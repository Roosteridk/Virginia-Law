45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|I|Administration|||2|Interstate Mining Compact|||||§ 45.2-201|(Effective October 1, 2021) Interstate Mining Compact.|<p>INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT</p><p>ARTICLE I  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES</p><p>A. The party states find that:</p><p>1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance.</p><p>2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water, and other resources for other uses present special problems that properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public.</p><p>3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.</p><p>4. Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources, but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated.</p><p>5. The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles and with due regard for local conditions.</p><p>B. The purposes of this compact are to:</p><p>1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water, and other resources affected by mining.</p><p>2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water, and air attributable to mining.</p><p>3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states that will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.</p><p>4. Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration, or protection of such land and other resources.</p><p>5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.</p><p>ARTICLE II  DEFINITIONS</p><p>As used in this compact:</p><p>"Mining" means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of onsite farming or construction.</p><p>"State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States.</p><p>ARTICLE III  STATE PROGRAMS</p><p>Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:</p><p>1. The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations.</p><p>2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational, or aesthetic value and utility of land and water.</p><p>3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.</p><p>4. The prevention, abatement, and control of water, air, and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past, and future.</p><p>ARTICLE IV  POWERS</p><p>In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Interstate Mining Commission, established by Article V of this compact, the Commission shall have power to:</p><p>1. Study mining operations, processes, and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes, and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change.</p><p>2. Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement, and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining.</p><p>3. Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact.</p><p>4. Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact.</p><p>5. Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interest in any subject coming within the purview of this compact.</p><p>6. Consult, upon the request of a party state and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact.</p><p>7. Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations.</p><p>8. Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources that are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.</p><p>ARTICLE V  THE COMMISSION</p><p>A. There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the Interstate Mining Commission (the Commission). The Commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each party state who shall be the Governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party state, each Governor shall have the assistance of any advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other public and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his state on the Commission. In any instance where a Governor is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the Commission, he shall designate an alternate from among the members of the advisory body required by this subsection who shall represent him and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the Governor to the Commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.</p><p>B. The commissioners shall be entitled to one vote each on the Commission. No action of the Commission making a recommendation pursuant to subdivision 3, 7, or 8 of Article IV or requesting, accepting, or disposing of funds, services, or other property pursuant to this subsection, subsection G or H of this article, or Article VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting, provided that action of the Commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, is present. The Commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The Commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.</p><p>C. The Commission shall have a seal.</p><p>D. The Commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The Commission shall appoint an Executive Director and fix his duties and compensation. Such Executive Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Executive Director, the Treasurer, and such other personnel as the Commission shall designate shall be bonded. The amount or amounts of such bond or bonds shall be determined by the Commission.</p><p>E. Irrespective of the civil service, personnel, or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the Executive Director with the approval of the Commission shall appoint, remove, or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Commission's functions and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.</p><p>F. The Commission may establish and maintain independently or in conjunction with a party state, a suitable retirement system for its employees. Employees of the Commission shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivor's insurance, provided that the Commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to the laws of the United States to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Commission may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as it may deem appropriate.</p><p>G. The Commission may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation.</p><p>H. The Commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and service, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the Commission pursuant to this subsection or services borrowed pursuant to subsection G of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the Commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount, and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.</p><p>I. The Commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The Commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.</p><p>J. The Commission annually shall make to the Governor, legislature, and advisory body required by subsection A of this article of each party state a report covering the activities of the Commission for the preceding year and embodying such recommendations as may have been made by the Commission. The Commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</p><p>ARTICLE VI  ADVISORY, TECHNICAL, AND REGIONAL COMMITTEES</p><p>The Commission shall establish such advisory, technical, and regional committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which shall include private persons and public officials, and shall cooperate with and use the services of any such committees and the organizations that the members represent in furthering any of its activities. Such committees may be formed to consider problems of special interest to any party states, problems dealing with particular commodities or types of mining operations, problems related to reclamation, development, or use of mined land, or any other matters of concern to the Commission.</p><p>ARTICLE VII  FINANCE</p><p>A. The Commission shall submit to the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p><p>B. Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-half in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the Commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.</p><p>C. The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under subsection H of Article V, provided that the Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Commission makes use of funds available to it under subsection H of Article V, the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p><p>D. The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.</p><p>E. The accounts of the Commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Commission.</p><p>F.

Within 30 days after the applicant is notified of the final decision of the Director on such permit application, the applicant, or any person with an interest that is or might be adversely affected, may request a hearing on the reasons for the final determination. The Director shall hold a formal adjudicatory hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-4000/'>2.2-4000</a> et seq.) and within 30 days thereafter shall issue to the applicant and every person who participated in the hearing the written decision of the Director granting or denying the permit in whole or in part and stating the reasons therefor. No person who presided at an informal hearing under § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1014/'>45.2-1014</a> shall preside at the formal adjudicatory hearing or participate in the decision therein or any administrative appeal therefrom.</p><p>C. Where a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection B, the Director, under such conditions as he prescribes, may grant temporary relief pending final determination of the proceedings if:</p><p>1. All parties to the proceeding have been notified and given an opportunity to be heard on any request for temporary relief;</p><p>2. The person requesting such relief shows that there is a substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the final determination of the proceeding; and</p><p>3. Such relief will not adversely affect the public health or safety or cause significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.</p><p>D. Any applicant or person who has an interest that is or might be adversely affected and has participated in the formal hearing as an objector who is aggrieved by the decision of the Director or by the failure of the Director to act within the time limits specified in this chapter has a right to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-4000/'>2.2-4000</a> et seq.).</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-240; 1983, c. 92; 1986, c. 615; 2021, Sp.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|II|Coal Mining|C|Surface Coal Mines|10|Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979|2|Regulation of Mining Activity|||§ 45.2-1016| Performance bonds.|<p>A. After a coal surface mining permit application has been approved, but before such permit is issued, the applicant shall file with the Director, on a form prescribed and furnished by the Director, a bond for performance payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the faithful performance of all the requirements of this chapter and the permit. The bond shall cover that area of land within the permit area upon which the operator plans to initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the initial term of the permit. As each succeeding increment of coal surface mining and reclamation operations is initiated and conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall file with the Director an additional bond to cover such increment in accordance with this section. The amount of the bond required for each bonded area shall be determined by the Director and shall (i) depend upon the reclamation requirements of the approved permit and (ii) reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such factors as topography, geology of the site, hydrology, and revegetation potential. The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work is performed by the Director in the event of forfeiture but in no case shall the bond for the entire area under one permit be less than $10,000.</p><p>B. Liability under a performance bond shall be for the duration of the coal surface mining and reclamation operation and for a period coincident with the operator's responsibility for revegetation as required under regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1017/'>45.2-1017</a>. The bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in the Commonwealth, except that the operator may elect to deposit cash, negotiable bonds of the United States or the Commonwealth, or negotiable certificates of deposit of any bank organized for transacting business in the United States. The cash deposit or market value of such securities shall be equal to or greater than the amount of the bond required for the bonded area.</p><p>C. Cash or securities deposited pursuant to subsection B shall be deposited upon the same terms as the terms upon which surety bonds may be deposited. Such securities shall be security for the repayment of such negotiable certificate of deposit.</p><p>D. The Director may accept a letter of credit on certain designated funds issued by a financial institution authorized to do business in the United States. Such letter of credit shall be irrevocable and unconditional, shall be payable to the Department upon demand, and shall afford the Department protection equivalent to a corporate surety's bond. Such letter of credit shall be provided on a form and in a format established by the Director. Nothing in this section shall relieve the permittee of responsibility under the permit or the issuer of liability on the letter of credit.</p><p>E. The issuer of a letter of credit pursuant to subsection D shall give prompt notice to the permittee and the Department of any notice received or action filed alleging the insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuer, or alleging any violation of a regulatory requirement that could result in the suspension or revocation of the issuer's charter or license to do business. In the event the issuer becomes unable to fulfill any of its obligations under the letter of credit for any reason, the issuer shall immediately notify the permittee and the Department. Upon the incapacity of an issuer by a reason of bankruptcy, insolvency, or the suspension or revocation of its charter or license, the permittee shall be deemed to be without proper performance bond coverage and shall promptly notify the Department. The Department shall then issue a notice to the permittee specifying a reasonable period not exceeding 90 days to replace bond coverage. If an adequate bond is not posted by the end of the period allowed, the permittee shall cease coal extraction and coal processing operations and shall immediately begin to conduct reclamation operations in accordance with its reclamation plan. No coal extraction or coal processing operation shall resume until the Department has determined that an acceptable bond has been posted. If an acceptable bond has not been posted by the end of the period allowed, the Department may suspend the permit until an acceptable bond is posted.</p><p>F. The Director may develop and adopt an alternative system to achieve the objectives and purposes of the bonding program established under this section.</p><p>G. The amount of the bond or deposit required and the terms of each acceptance of the applicant's bond shall be adjusted by the Director from time to time as affected land acreages are increased or decreased or where the cost of future reclamation changes.</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-241; 1984, c. 590; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0285'>285</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0692'>692</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0111'>111</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0135'>135</a>; 2021, Sp.

For the purpose of administering and enforcing any permit issued under this chapter or determining whether any person is in violation of any requirement of this chapter or any regulation adopted hereunder:</p><p>1. The Director shall require any permittee to (i) establish and maintain appropriate records; (ii) make monthly reports to the Division; (iii) install, use, and maintain any necessary monitoring equipment or methods; (iv) evaluate results in accordance with such methods, at such locations and intervals and in such manner as the Director prescribes; and (v) provide other information relative to a coal surface mining and reclamation operation as the Director deems reasonable and necessary;</p><p>2. For any coal surface mining and reclamation operation that removes or disturbs strata that serve as aquifers and thereby significantly ensure the hydrologic balance of water use, either on or off the mining site, the Director shall specify monitoring sites at which the permittee shall record (i) the quantity and quality of surface drainage above and below the mine site and in the potential zone of influence; (ii) the level, amount, and characteristics of samples of groundwater and aquifers that are potentially affected by mining or are located directly below the deepest coal seam to be mined; and (iii) amount of precipitation. The Director shall specify certain records of well logs and borehole data to be maintained. The monitoring, data collection, and analysis required by this section shall be conducted according to standards and procedures set forth in regulations adopted by the Director in order to assure their reliability and validity; and</p><p>3. Any authorized representative of the Director, without advance notice and upon presentation of appropriate credentials, has (i) the right of entry to, upon, or through any coal surface mining and reclamation operation and (ii) the right to inspect any monitoring equipment, method of exploration, method of operation, or records required by this chapter and to copy any such records.</p><p>No search warrant shall be required for any entry or inspection under this subsection, except with respect to entry into a building.</p><p>B. Inspections by the Director shall (i) occur on an irregular basis averaging not less than one partial inspection per month and one complete inspection per calendar quarter for the coal surface mining and reclamation operation covered by each permit, (ii) occur without prior notice to the permittee or any agent or employee of the permittee except for necessary on-site meetings with the permittee, and (iii) include the filing of inspection reports adequate to enforce the requirements of this chapter and carry out its terms and purposes.</p><p>C. Each permittee shall conspicuously maintain at the entrance to each coal surface mining and reclamation operation a clearly visible sign setting forth such information as is prescribed by regulation.</p><p>D. Each inspector, upon detection of a violation of any requirement of this chapter or of a regulation adopted hereunder, shall promptly inform the operator in writing and shall report such violation to the Director in writing.</p><p>E. Copies of any records, reports, inspection materials, or information obtained by the Director under this article shall be made immediately available to the public at central and sufficient locations in the area of mining so that they are conveniently available to residents in such areas. However, information that pertains only to the analysis of the chemical and physical properties of the coal, excepting information regarding mineral or elemental content that is potentially toxic in the environment, shall be kept confidential and be exempt from disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-3700/'>2.2-3700</a> et seq.).</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-244; 1984, cc. 323, 590; 2021, Sp.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|II|Coal Mining|C|Surface Coal Mines|10|Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979|2|Regulation of Mining Activity|||§ 45.2-1020| Enforcement of chapter generally.|<p>A. If the Director determines that any condition or practice or any violation by a permittee of any requirement of this chapter, regulation adopted hereunder, or permit condition (i) creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or (ii) is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Director shall immediately order a cessation of the coal surface mining and reclamation operation or the portion thereof relevant to the condition, practice, or violation. Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the Director determines that the condition, practice, or violation has been abated or until such order is modified, vacated, or terminated by the Director. Whenever the Director finds that the ordered cessation of coal surface mining and reclamation operations, or any portion thereof, is not expected to completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Director shall, in addition to ordering the cessation of the operation, impose affirmative obligations on the operator and require such operator to take whatever steps the Director determines necessary to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.</p><p>B. If the Director determines that a permittee is in violation of any requirement of this chapter, any regulation adopted hereunder, or any permit condition, but such violation does not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or cannot reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Director shall issue a notice of violation to the permittee or his agent setting a reasonable period of not more than 90 days for the abatement of the violation and shall provide an opportunity for public hearing.</p><p>C. Upon expiration of the period of time originally set pursuant to subsection B or subsequently extended for good cause shown upon the written finding of the Director, if the Director finds that a violation has not been abated, he shall immediately order a cessation of coal surface mining and reclamation operations or the portion thereof relevant to the violation. Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the Director determines that the violation has been abated or until such order is modified, vacated, or terminated by the Director pursuant to subsection E. The Director shall include in the cessation order the necessary measures to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible.</p><p>D. Whenever the Director determines that a pattern of violations of the requirements of this chapter, any regulation adopted hereunder, or any permit condition exists or has existed, and if the Director also finds that such violations are (i) caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with any such requirements or (ii) willfully caused by the permittee, the Director shall promptly issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked and shall provide opportunity for a formal public hearing. If a hearing is requested, the Director shall inform all interested parties of the time and place of the hearing. Upon the permittee's failure to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the Director shall promptly suspend or revoke the permit.</p><p>E. Each notice or order issued pursuant to this section shall set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation and the remedial action required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the coal surface mining and reclamation operation to which the notice or order applies. Each notice or order shall be given promptly to the permittee or his agent by the Director and shall be in writing and signed by the Director. Any notice or order issued pursuant to this section may be modified, vacated, or terminated by the Director. Any notice or order issued pursuant to this section that requires cessation of mining by the operator shall expire within 30 days of actual notice to the operator unless an informal public hearing is held at the site or close enough to the site to allow viewings thereof during the course of the public hearing. Such informal public hearing may be waived by the operator.</p><p>F. The Director may institute a civil action for injunctive or other relief in any court of competent jurisdiction whenever any permittee or his agent, or any other person:</p><p>1. Violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order or decision issued by the Director;</p><p>2. Interferes with, hinders, or delays the Director in carrying out the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder;</p><p>3. Refuses to admit the Director to a mine;</p><p>4. Refuses to permit inspection of a mine;</p><p>5. Refuses to furnish any information or report requested by the Director pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder;</p><p>6. Refuses to permit access to, and copying of, such records as the Director determines necessary in carrying out the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder; or</p><p>7.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|II|Coal Mining|C|Surface Coal Mines|10|Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979|2|Regulation of Mining Activity|||§ 45.2-1021| Civil and criminal penalties.|<p>A. Any permittee who violates any permit condition or any other provision of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the Director, except that if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order, the civil penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation except that if the violation resulted in a personal injury or fatality to any person, then the civil penalty shall not exceed $70,000 for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for the purposes of assessing penalties. In determining the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to the permittee's history of previous violations at the particular coal surface mining operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.</p><p>B. A civil penalty may be assessed by the Director only after the person charged with a violation has been given an opportunity for a public hearing. After such public hearing has been held, the Director shall make findings of fact and issue a written decision as to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty that is warranted, incorporating therein, when appropriate, an order requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the Director shall consolidate such hearing with other proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any hearing under this section shall be a formal adjudicatory hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-4000/'>2.2-4000</a> et seq.). If the person charged with such violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the Director after the Director determines that a violation has occurred and the amount of the penalty warranted and issues an order requiring that the penalty be paid.</p><p>C. Upon the issuance of a notice or order charging that a violation described under subsection A has occurred, the Director shall inform the permittee within 30 days of the proposed amount of the penalty. Such permittee shall, within 30 days of being so informed, pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the permittee contests either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, forward the proposed amount to the Director for placement in an interest-bearing trust account in the state treasury. Failure to forward the money to the Director within 30 days constitutes a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty it is determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty will be reduced, the Director shall within 30 days of such determination remit the appropriate amount to the permittee with accrued interest thereon.</p><p>D. If a permittee required to pay a civil penalty fails to do so, the Director may transmit a true copy of the final order assessing such penalty to the clerk of the court of any county or city wherein it is ascertained that the permittee owing the penalty has any estate; and the clerk to whom such copy is sent shall record such final order, as a judgment is required by law to be recorded, and index it in the name of the Commonwealth and the name of the person owing the penalty. Upon such recording and indexing, there shall be a lien in favor of the Commonwealth on the property of the permittee within such county or city in the amount of the penalty. The Director may collect civil penalties that are owed in the same manner as provided by law in respect to judgment of a court of record. All civil penalties shall be paid into a special fund in the state treasury to be used by the Director for enhancing conservation and recreational opportunities in the coal-producing counties of the Commonwealth. The Director shall transfer quarterly 50 percent of the fund balance to the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority, created pursuant to Chapter 60 (§ <a href='/vacode/15.2-6000/'>15.2-6000</a> et seq.) of Title 15.2, for the purposes of developing infrastructure and improvements at Breaks Interstate Park and 50 percent of the fund balance to the Heart of Appalachia Tourism Authority for the purpose of developing conservation and recreational opportunities consistent with the provisions of Chapter 55 (§ <a href='/vacode/15.2-5500/'>15.2-5500</a> et seq.) of Title 15.2.</p><p>E. Any person who willfully and knowingly (i) conducts any coal surface mining or coal exploration operation without first obtaining a permit, or after a permit has lapsed, or after suspension or revocation of a permit; (ii) violates a condition of a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; or (iii) disregards or fails or refuses to comply with any regulation adopted or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision under subsection B, shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, by confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, or both.</p><p>F. Whenever a corporate permittee violates a condition of a permit or disregards or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under subsection B, any director, officer, or agent of such corporation who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or refusal is subject to the same civil penalties, fines, and confinement in jail to which a person may be subject under subsections A and E.</p><p>G. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any required statement, representation, or certification, in any application, objection, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, any regulation adopted hereunder, or any order or decision issued by the Director under this chapter shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, by confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, or both.</p><p>H. Any operator who within the period permitted for the correction of such violation fails to correct a violation for which a notice or order has been issued shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than $750 for each day during which such failure or violation occurs. Such period for the correction of a violation shall not end until the entry of (i) a final order by the Director, in the case of any review proceedings initiated by the operator wherein the Director orders, after an expedited hearing, the suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or order after determining that the operator is likely to suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of such requirements or (ii) an order of the court, in the case of any review proceedings initiated by the operator wherein the court orders the suspension of the abatement requirements.</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-246; 1980, c. 510; 1993, c. 663; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0003'>3</a>; 2021, Sp.

The Director shall establish a planning process that enables objective decisions, based on competent and scientifically sound data and information, regarding which land areas of the Commonwealth, if any, are unsuitable for coal surface mining operations pursuant to the standards set forth in subdivisions 2 and 3. Such designation shall not prevent the mineral exploration pursuant to this chapter of any area so designated.</p><p>2. Upon petition pursuant to subsection C, the Director shall designate a land area as unsuitable for all or certain types of coal surface mining operations if the Director determines that reclamation pursuant to the requirements of this chapter is not technologically and economically feasible.</p><p>3. Upon petition pursuant to subsection C, the Director may designate a surface area as unsuitable for certain types of coal surface mining operations if such operations will (i) be incompatible with existing land use plans or programs; (ii) affect fragile or historic lands in which such operations could result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, scientific, or aesthetic values or natural systems; (iii) affect renewable resource lands, including aquifers and aquifer recharge areas, in which such operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of water supply or food or fiber products; or (iv) affect natural hazard lands, including areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology, in which such operations could substantially endanger life and property.</p><p>4. Any determination of the unsuitability of a land area for coal surface mining made pursuant to this section shall be integrated as closely as possible with present and future land use planning and regulation processes at the federal, state, and local levels.</p><p>5. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any land area (i) on which a coal surface mining operation was being conducted on August 3, 1977; (ii) on which a coal surface mining operation was being conducted under a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of the federal act; or (iii) where substantial legal and financial commitments in either such operation were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.</p><p>B. Prior to designating any land area as unsuitable for a coal surface mining operation, the Director shall cause to be prepared a detailed statement on (i) the potential coal resources of the area, (ii) the demand for coal resources, and (iii) the impact of such designation on the environment, the economy, and the supply of coal.</p><p>C. Any person having an interest that is or could be adversely affected has the right to petition the Director to have an area designated as unsuitable for coal surface mining operations, or to have such a designation terminated. Such petition shall contain allegations of facts with supporting evidence that would tend to establish the allegations. Within 10 months after receipt of the petition, the Department shall hold a public hearing in the locality in which the affected area is located, after appropriate notice and publication of the date, time, and location of the hearing. After a person having an interest that is or could be adversely affected has filed a petition but before the hearing required by this subsection has taken place, any person may intervene by filing allegations of facts with supporting evidence that would tend to establish the allegations. The Director shall issue and furnish to the petitioner and any other party to the hearing, within 60 days after such hearing, a written decision regarding the petition and the reasons therefor. In the event that all petitioners stipulate agreement prior to the hearing and withdraw their requests, such hearing need not be held.</p><p>D. Subject to valid existing rights, no coal surface mining operation, except an operation that existed on August 3, 1977, shall be permitted:</p><p>1. On any lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers designated under § 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; any National Recreation Area designated by act of Congress; or any federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest, except as otherwise provided by federal law;</p><p>2. That will adversely affect any publicly owned park or any site listed in the National Register of Historic Places unless approved jointly by the Director and the federal, state, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or historic site;</p><p>3. Within 100 feet of the outside right-of-way line of any public road, except where a mine access road or haulage road joins such right-of-way line. However, the Director may permit such mine access or haulage road to be relocated or the area affected to lie within 100 feet of such public road if, after public notice and opportunity for hearing in the locality, a written finding is made that the interests of the public and landowners affected thereby will be protected; or</p><p>4. Within 300 feet of any occupied dwelling, unless waived by the owner thereof; within 300 feet of any public building, school, church, community or institutional building, or public park; or within 100 feet of a cemetery.</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-252; 1984, c. 590; 2021, Sp.

The Director shall take all reasonable actions to obtain written consent from the owner or owners of record of the land or property to be entered onto to perform an inspection for purposes of reclamation or for conducting studies or exploratory work pertaining to the need for and feasibility of reclamation, prior to such entry.</p><p>B. The provisions of subsection C shall apply if the Director, pursuant to an approved state program, makes findings of fact that:</p><p>1. Land or water resources have been adversely affected by past coal mining practices;</p><p>2. The adverse effects are significant enough that, in the public interest, action to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent such effects should be taken; and</p><p>3. The owners of the land or water resources where entry will be made to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices (i) are not known or readily available or (ii) will not give permission for the Director or his agents, employees, or contractors to enter upon such property to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p><p>C. Upon making the findings of fact required by subsection B and giving notice by certified mail to the owners if known or, if not known, by posting notice upon the premises and advertising once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city in which the land lies, the Director, his agents, employees, or contractors shall have the right to enter upon the property adversely affected by past coal mining practices and any other property to have access to such property to do all things necessary or expedient to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects. Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation of property or trespass thereon. The moneys expended for such work and the benefits accruing to any such premises so entered upon shall be chargeable against such land to the extent provided in § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1036/'>45.2-1036</a> and shall mitigate or offset any claim in or any action brought by any owner of any interest in such premises for any alleged damages by virtue of such entry. Such provision regarding the mitigation or offsetting of a claim or action by an owner is not intended to create new rights of action or eliminate the existing sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth and its agents and employees.</p><p>D. The Director and his agents, employees, or contractors shall have the right to enter upon any property for the purpose of conducting studies or exploratory work to determine the existence of adverse effects of past coal mining practices and to determine the feasibility of restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of such adverse effects. Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation of property or trespass thereon.</p><p>E. The Director, pursuant to an approved state program, may acquire title in the name of the Commonwealth to any land or interest therein by purchase, donation, or condemnation, if such land or interest is adversely affected by past coal mining practices, after approval of the Secretary and upon determinations that acquisition of such land is necessary for successful reclamation and that:</p><p>1. The acquired land, after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices, will serve recreational, historical, conservation, or reclamation purposes or provide open space benefits; and</p><p>2. Either (a) permanent facilities, such as a treatment plant or a relocated stream channel, will be constructed on the land for the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices or (b) acquisition of coal refuse disposal sites and all coal refuse thereon will serve the purposes of this article or that public ownership is desirable to meet emergency situations and prevent recurrences of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p><p>F. The price paid for land acquired under this section shall reflect the market value of the land as adversely affected by past coal mining practices.</p><p>G. The Director, with the approval of the Secretary, and in accordance with the State Reclamation Plan, may:</p><p>1. Transfer the administrative responsibility for land acquired under this section to any state, regional, or local agency, department, or institution, with or without cost, upon terms that will ensure that the use of the land is consistent with the authorization under which the land was acquired;</p><p>2. Sell land acquired under this section that is suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational development, by public sale under a system of competitive bidding, at not less than fair market value and under regulations adopted to ensure that such lands are put to proper use consistent with local, state, or federal land use plans, if any, for the area in which the land is located; and</p><p>3. Transfer land acquired under this section to the United States to be reclaimed by the Secretary. After such reclamation is completed, any state, regional, or local agency, department, or institution may purchase such land from the Secretary for governmental, educational, recreational, historical, open-space, or other public purpose upon such terms as the Secretary requires.</p><p>H. Prior to the disposition of any land acquired under this section, the Director, pursuant to the State Reclamation Plan, when requested and after appropriate public notice, shall hold a public hearing in the county or city or counties or cities where the land is located. The hearing shall be held at a time that shall afford local citizens and governments the maximum opportunity to participate in the decision concerning the use or disposition of the lands after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p><p>I. The Director may authorize the use, pending disposition, of land acquired under this section for any lawful purpose that is not inconsistent with the reclamation and post-reclamation uses for which the land was acquired. The Director shall charge any user of the land a reasonable use fee that shall go toward the purpose of operating and maintaining improvement of the land, and any excess thereof shall be deposited in the State Reclamation Fund. The Director may waive the fee if the Director finds in writing that a waiver is in the public interest.</p><p>J. Any state, regional, or local agency, department, or institution may purchase or otherwise acquire and develop lands that the Secretary is authorized to dispose of pursuant to § 407(h) of the federal act.</p><p>1979, c. 290, § 45.1-263; 2021, Sp.

In deciding on objections by a coal owner to a proposed permit modification or drilling unit modification, only the following questions shall be considered:</p><p>1. Whether the work can be done safely with respect to persons engaged in coal mining at or near the well site; and</p><p>2. Whether the well work is an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the well operator's right to explore for, market, and produce gas or oil.</p><p>B. In deciding on objections by a coal owner to the establishment of a drilling unit, the issuance of a permit for a new well, or the stimulation of a coalbed methane gas well, the following safety aspects shall first be considered, and no order or permit shall be issued where the evidence indicates that the proposed activity will be unsafe:</p><p>1. Whether the drilling unit or drilling location is above or in close proximity to any mine opening or shaft, entry, travel way, airway, haulageway, drainageway, or passageway, or to any proposed extension thereof, in any operated or abandoned or operating coal mine or in any coal mine already surveyed and platted but not yet being operated;</p><p>2. Whether the proposed drilling can reasonably be done through an existing or planned pillar of coal, or in close proximity to an existing well or such pillar of coal, taking into consideration the surface topography;</p><p>3. Whether the proposed well can be drilled safely or the proposed coalbed methane gas well can be stimulated safely, taking into consideration the dangers from creeps, squeezes, or other disturbances due to the extraction of coal; and</p><p>4. The extent to which the proposed drilling unit or drilling location or stimulation of the coalbed methane gas well unreasonably interferes with the safe recovery of coal, gas, or oil.</p><p>C. The following questions with respect to the drilling unit or drilling location of a new well or stimulation of a new coalbed methane gas well shall also be considered:</p><p>1. The extent to which the proposed drilling unit or drilling location or coalbed methane gas well stimulation will unreasonably interfere with present or future coal mining operations;</p><p>2. The feasibility of moving the proposed drilling unit or drilling location to a mined-out area, an area below the coal outcrop, or some other area;</p><p>3. The feasibility of a drilling moratorium for not more than two years in order to permit the completion of coal mining operations;</p><p>4. The methods proposed for the recovery of coal and gas;</p><p>5. The practicality of locating the unit or the well on a uniform pattern with other units or wells;</p><p>6. The surface topography and use; and</p><p>7. Whether the decision will substantially affect the right of the gas operator to explore for and produce the gas.</p><p>D. The factors in subsection C are not intended to and shall not be construed to authorize the Director, or the Board under § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1638/'>45.2-1638</a>, to supersede, impair, abridge, or affect any contractual rights or obligations existing between the respective owners of coal and gas or any interest therein.</p><p>1982, c. 347, § 45.1-318; 1990, c. 92, § 45.1-361.11; 2021, Sp.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|IV|Gas and Oil|||16|Virginia Gas and Oil Act|2|Gas and Oil Conservation|||§ 45.2-1619| Field rules and drilling units for wells; hearings and orders.|<p>A. In order to prevent the waste of gas or oil or the drilling of unnecessary wells or to protect correlative rights, the Board on its own motion or upon application of the gas or oil owner may establish or modify drilling units. Drilling units, to the extent reasonably possible, shall be of uniform shape and size for an entire pool. Any gas, oil, or royalty owner may apply to the Board for the establishment of field rules and the creation of drilling units for the field. Unless such motion is made or an application is received at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Board, it shall not be heard by the Board at such meeting and shall be heard at the next meeting of the Board thereafter.</p><p>B. At any hearing of the Board regarding the establishment or modification of drilling units, the Board shall make the following determinations:</p><p>1. Whether the proposed drilling unit is an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of a gas or oil owner's right to explore for or produce gas or oil;</p><p>2. Whether the proposal would unreasonably interfere with the present or future mining of coal or other minerals;</p><p>3. The acreage to be included in the order;</p><p>4. The acreage to be embraced within each drilling unit and its shape;</p><p>5. The area within which wells may be drilled on each unit; and</p><p>6. The allowable production of each well.</p><p>C. In establishing or modifying a drilling unit for coalbed methane gas wells, and in order to accommodate the unique characteristics of coalbed methane development, the Board shall require that drilling units conform to the mine development plan, if any. If requested by the coal operator, well spacing shall correspond with mine operations, including the drilling of multiple coalbed methane gas wells on each drilling unit.</p><p>D. If an order to establish or modify a drilling unit will allow a well to be drilled into or through a coal seam, any coal owner within the area to be covered by the drilling unit may object to the establishment of the drilling unit. Upon a coal owner's objection, and without superseding, impairing, abridging, or affecting any contractual rights or obligations existing between coal and gas owners, the Board shall make its determination in accordance with the provisions of §§ <a href='/vacode/45.2-1611/'>45.2-1611</a> and <a href='/vacode/45.2-1612/'>45.2-1612</a>.</p><p>E. The Board may continue a hearing to its next meeting to allow for further investigation and the gathering and taking of additional data and evidence. If at the time of a hearing there is not sufficient evidence for the Board to determine field boundaries, drilling unit size or shape, or allowable production, the Board may enter a temporary order establishing provisional drilling units, field boundaries, and allowable production for the orderly development of the pool pending receipt of the information necessary to determine the ultimate pool boundaries, spacing of wells for the pool, and allowable production. Upon additional findings of fact, the boundaries of a pool, drilling units for the pool, and allowable production may be modified by the Board.</p><p>F. Unless otherwise provided for by the Board, after an application for a hearing to establish or modify drilling units or pool boundaries has been filed, no additional well shall be permitted in the pool until the Board's order establishing or modifying the pool or units has been entered.</p><p>G. After the Board issues a field or pool spacing order that creates drilling units or a pattern of drilling units for a pool, if a gas or oil owner applies for a permit or otherwise indicates his desire to drill a well outside of such drilling units or pattern of drilling units and thereby potentially extend the pool, the Board may, on its own motion or the motion of any interested person, require that the well be located and drilled in compliance with the provisions of the order affecting the pool.</p><p>1982, c. 347, § 45.1-301; 1987, c. 452; 1989, c. 529; 1990, c. 92, § 45.1-361.20; 2021, Sp.

Two or more separately owned tracts are embraced in a drilling unit;</p><p>2. There are separately owned interests in all or part of any such drilling unit and those owners having interests have not agreed to pool their interests; or</p><p>3. There are separately owned tracts embraced within the minimum statewide spacing requirements prescribed in § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1616/'>45.2-1616</a>.</p><p>However, no pooling order shall be entered until the notice and hearing requirements of this article have been satisfied.</p><p>B. Subject to any contrary provision contained in a gas or oil lease regarding the property, gas or oil operations incident to the drilling of a well on any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed to be the conduct of such operations on each tract in the unit. The portion of production allocated to any tract covered by a pooling order shall be in the same proportion as the acreage of that tract bears to the total acreage of the unit.</p><p>C. Every pooling order entered by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this section shall:</p><p>1. Authorize the drilling and operation of a well, including the stimulation of all coal seams in the case of a coalbed methane well when authorized pursuant to clause (iii) of subdivision F 2 b of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1631/'>45.2-1631</a>, subject to the permit provisions contained in Article 3 (§ <a href='/vacode/45.2-1629/'>45.2-1629</a> et seq.);</p><p>2. Include the time and date when such order expires;</p><p>3. Designate the gas or oil owner who is authorized to drill and operate the well. Except in the case of a coalbed methane gas well, such designated operator shall possess the right to conduct operations or possess the written consent of owners with the right to conduct operations on at least 25 percent of the acreage included in the unit;</p><p>4. Prescribe the conditions under which a gas or oil owner may become a participating operator or exercise a right of election under subdivision 7;</p><p>5. Establish the sharing of all reasonable costs, including a reasonable supervision fee, between participating operators so that each participating operator pays the same percentage of such costs as his acreage bears to the total unit acreage;</p><p>6. Require that any nonleasing gas or oil owner be provided with reasonable access to unit records submitted to the Director or Inspector;</p><p>7. Establish a procedure for a gas or oil owner who received notice of the hearing but does not decide to become a participating operator to elect to (i) sell or lease his gas or oil ownership to a participating operator, (ii) enter into a voluntary agreement to share in the operation of the well at a rate of payment mutually agreed to by the gas or oil owner and the gas or oil operator authorized to drill the well, or (iii) share in the operation of the well as a nonparticipating operator on a carried basis after the proceeds allocable to his share equal the following:</p><p>a. In the case of a leased tract, 300 percent of the share of such costs allocable to his interest; or</p><p>b. In the case of an unleased tract, 200 percent of the share of such costs allocable to his interest.</p><p>D. Any gas or oil owner whose identity and location remain unknown at the conclusion of a hearing concerning the establishment of a pooling order for which public notice was given shall be deemed to have elected to lease his interest to the gas or oil operator at a rate to be established by the Board. The Board shall cause to be established an escrow account into which the unknown lessor's share of proceeds shall be paid and held for his benefit. Such escrowed proceeds shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and shall be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-2500/'>55.1-2500</a> et seq.). Upon discovery of the identity and location of any unknown owner of an interest that is subject to escrow under the provisions of this subsection and is not subject to conflicting claims of ownership, the designated operator shall, within 30 days, file with the Board a petition for disbursement of funds to be considered at the next available hearing. The petition shall include a detailed accounting of all funds deposited in escrow that are subject to the proposed disbursement.</p><p>E. Any person who does not make an election under the pooling order shall be deemed to have leased his gas or oil interest to the gas or oil well operator as the pooling order provides.</p><p>F. If a gas or oil owner is a person under a disability, the applicant for a pooling order may petition the appropriate circuit court to appoint a guardian ad litem pursuant to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-261/'>8.01-261</a> for purposes of making the election provided for by this section.</p><p>G. Any royalty or overriding royalty reserved in any lease that is deducted from a nonparticipating operator's share of production shall not be subject to charges for operating costs but shall be separately calculated and paid to the royalty owner.</p><p>H. The Board shall resolve all disputes arising among gas or oil operators regarding the amount and reasonableness of well operation costs.

The Board shall enter an order requiring that the matter of disputed ownership be submitted to arbitration and notify the circuit court in the jurisdiction in which the majority of the subject tract is located (i) upon written request from all claimants to the ownership of coalbed methane gas related to the subject tract under § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1622/'>45.2-1622</a>; (ii) upon receipt of an affidavit executed by all such claimants affirming that there is no other known surface owner, gas or oil owner, coal owner, mineral owner, or operator of a gas storage field certificated by the State Corporation Commission having an interest underlying the subject tract; (iii) after a hearing noticed pursuant to subsection B of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a>; and (iv) upon a determination by the Department whether sufficient funds are available to pay the estimated costs of the arbitration pursuant to subsection F. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice from the Board, the circuit court shall appoint an attorney from the list maintained by the Department pursuant to subsection C or, at the discretion of the court, another attorney meeting the qualifications set forth in subsection C. Prior to his appointment as an arbitrator of a particular dispute, the attorney shall certify to the circuit court that he has not derived more than 10 percent of his income during any of the preceding three years from any (a) claimants asserting ownership or rights in the subject tract or (b) affiliated entities or immediate family members of such claimants. If the attorney cannot provide such certification, he shall notify the circuit court and he will be disqualified from serving as arbitrator for that particular dispute.</p><p>B. The Department shall send notice to all claimants if it determines that there are insufficient funds to pay the estimated costs of the arbitration pursuant to subsection F. The claimants may, by unanimous agreement, proceed with the arbitration process, notify the Board of such agreement, and bear the costs to the extent of the insufficiency. If the parties do not agree, the arbitration shall be delayed until such funds are available.</p><p>C. To be qualified as an arbitrator, a candidate shall (i) be an attorney licensed in the Commonwealth; (ii) have at least 10 years of experience in real estate law, including substantial expertise in mineral title examination; and (iii) disclose to the Board whether he has been engaged within the preceding three years by any person in a matter subject to the jurisdiction of the Board or the Department under this chapter.

The Department shall update its list at least once annually. To maintain qualification, each attorney whose name appears on the list shall update annually his disclosures as set forth in clause (iii).</p><p>D. The arbitrator shall determine a time and place for the arbitration hearing and cause written notification of such hearing to be served on each surface owner, gas or oil owner, coal owner, mineral owner, or operator of a gas storage field certificated by the State Corporation Commission having an interest underlying the tract that is the subject of the hearing. Parties shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 14 days before the hearing. Appearance at the hearing waives such party's right to challenge notice. Any party to the arbitration has the right to representation before the arbitrator pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/8.01-581.05/'>8.01-581.05</a>. In accordance with § <a href='/vacode/8.01-581.06/'>8.01-581.06</a>, the arbitrator may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and for the production of books, records, documents, and other evidence; administer oaths; and, upon application by a party to the arbitration, permit the taking of depositions for use as evidence. The arbitrator shall hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence and consistent with applicable law, notwithstanding the failure of a party to appear at the hearing.</p><p>E. The arbitrator shall issue his determination as to the ownership in the coalbed methane gas and entitlement to proceeds held in escrow within six months from the order of the Board requiring the matter be submitted to arbitration, unless a longer period is otherwise agreed to by all parties. Such determination shall be in writing and sent to the Board and to each party to whom notice is required to be given under subsection D.</p><p>F. Upon the issuance of the arbitrator's determination of ownership and subject to the availability of funds, the fees and expenses of the arbitration, but not including fees or costs of counsel engaged by the respective claimants or any other costs of the claimants, shall be paid from the accrued interest on general escrow account funds.</p><p>G. An arbitrator's determination rendered pursuant to subsection E shall be binding upon the parties, and upon request of any party to the arbitration such determination may be entered as the judgment of the circuit court responsible for appointing the arbitrator under subsection A.</p><p>H. Upon application of any party to the arbitration, a determination rendered pursuant to subsection E may be confirmed, vacated, corrected, or appealed pursuant to the grounds set forth in Chapter 21 (§ <a href='/vacode/8.01-577/'>8.01-577</a> et seq.) of Title 8.01.</p><p>2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0442'>442</a>, § 45.1-361.22:1; 2021, Sp.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|IV|Gas and Oil|||16|Virginia Gas and Oil Act|2|Gas and Oil Conservation|||§ 45.2-1624| Release of funds held in escrow or suspense because of conflicting claims to coalbed methane gas.|<p>A. For a coalbed methane gas well that was force-pooled prior to July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall, on or before January 1, 2016, apply to the Board for the release of the funds in escrow and give written notice of such application to every conflicting claimant identified in the pooling orders, or to the successor of such claimant where the successor is known to the coalbed methane gas well operator or has identified himself to the coalbed methane gas well operator or the Board. Such notice shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a> and, if any unknown person or unlocatable conflicting claimant is subject to escrow, such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties where the drilling unit is located once each week for four successive weeks. The application shall include a detailed accounting in accordance with subdivision B 5 of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1622/'>45.2-1622</a>. The Board shall order payment of the principal and accrued interest, less escrow account fees, held in escrow, along with all future royalties attributable to the drilling unit, to each gas claimant identified in the pooling order unless, within 45 days of the coalbed methane gas well operator's notice of its application, the coal claimant provides the Board and the coalbed methane gas well operator with evidence of a proceeding or agreement. The Board, pursuant to its authority granted by § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1614/'>45.2-1614</a>, may extend the time for filing the application and delay the payment of funds for a gas title conflict, the existence of an unknown gas claimant, the existence of an unlocatable gas claimant, an unresolved gas heirship issue, or any other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator and shall not order payment if the gas claimant fails to provide the Board with information needed under applicable law or regulation to distribute the funds.</p><p>B. For a coalbed methane gas well force-pooled on or after July 1, 2015, the Board, in its pooling order, shall direct the coalbed methane gas well operator to pay royalties to the gas claimant unless the coal claimant provides the coalbed methane gas well operator and the Board with evidence of a proceeding or agreement not later than the time and place of the pooling hearing. The coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide written notice of the hearing to every gas claimant and coal claimant in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a>. However, the Board, pursuant to its authority granted by § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1614/'>45.2-1614</a>, shall not order the coalbed methane gas well operator to make payment to a gas claimant if there exists any gas title conflict, unknown gas claimant, unlocatable gas claimant, unresolved gas heirship issue, or other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator or if the gas claimant fails to provide the coalbed methane gas well operator with the information required under applicable law or regulation to pay royalties. If the Board so declines to order payment to be made to a gas claimant, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide each affected gas claimant and the Board with written notice of the reason payment is not required to be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a>. If payment is not required to be made due to the gas claimant's failure to provide needed information under applicable law or regulation, the notice shall identify the information that is needed to enable the payment to be made.</p><p>C. For a coalbed methane gas well voluntarily pooled at any time, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall pay royalties, including past royalties held, to each gas claimant unless, within 45 days of the coalbed methane gas well operator's provision of written notice to the coal claimant that the operator will be paying royalties to the gas claimants, the coal claimant provides the coalbed methane gas well operator and each gas claimant with evidence of a proceeding or agreement. For any unit voluntarily pooled before July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide such written notice to each gas claimant and coal claimant on or before January 1, 2016. For any unit voluntarily pooled on or after July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide such written notice to each gas claimant and coal claimant not later than 45 days after production commences. However, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall not be required to make payment to a gas claimant if there exists any gas title conflict, unknown gas claimant, unlocatable gas claimant, unresolved gas heirship issue, or other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator or if the gas claimant fails to provide the coalbed methane gas well operator with information to process or pay royalties. If the Board so declines to order payment to be made to a gas claimant, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide each affected gas claimant with written notice of the reason payment is not required to be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a>. If payment is not required to be made due to a gas claimant's failure to provide needed information, the notice shall identify the information that is needed to enable the payment to be made.</p><p>D. Any pending judicial or arbitration proceeding shall be pursued by the coal claimant with diligence and shall not be voluntarily dismissed or nonsuited without the consent of the gas claimant. No default judgment shall be entered against a gas claimant in such proceeding. Royalties shall be paid as determined by the final order in the proceeding. A prevailing gas claimant may recover from the nonprevailing coal claimant reasonable costs and attorney fees if such gas claimant substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the coal claimant's position is not substantially justified.</p><p>E. A coalbed methane gas well operator paying funds to a gas claimant in accordance with this section shall have no liability to a coal claimant for the payments made by the coalbed methane gas well operator to a gas claimant.</p><p>F.

Every permit application or permit modification application filed with the Director shall be verified by the permit applicant and shall contain all data, maps, plats, plans, and other information as required by regulation or the Director.</p><p>B. For each permit issued on or after July 1, 1996, a new permit issued by the Director shall be issued only for the following activities: geophysical operations, drilling, casing, equipping, stimulating, producing, reworking an initially productive zone, plugging a well, or construction and operation of a gathering pipeline. An application for a new permit to conduct geophysical operations shall be accompanied by an application fee of $130. An application for a new permit for any other activity shall be accompanied by an application fee of $600.</p><p>C. For a permit issued prior to July 1, 1996, prior to commencing any reworking, deepening, or plugging of a well, or other activity not previously approved on the permitted site, a permittee shall first obtain a permit modification from the Director. Each application for a permit modification shall be accompanied by a permit modification fee of $300. For a permit issued on or after July 1, 1996, prior to commencing any new zone completion, a permittee shall first obtain a permit modification from the Director.</p><p>D. Every permit and all operations provided for under this section shall conform to the regulations and orders of the Director and the Board. If permit terms or conditions required or provided for under this article are in conflict with any provision of a conservation order issued pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 (§ <a href='/vacode/45.2-1613/'>45.2-1613</a> et seq.), the terms or conditions of the permit shall control. In such event, the operator shall return to the Board for reconsideration of the conservation order in light of the conflicting permit. Every permittee shall be responsible for all operations, activities, or disturbances associated with the permitted site.</p><p>E. No permit or permit modification shall be issued by the Director until he has received from the applicant a written certification that (i) all notice requirements of this article have been complied with, together with proof thereof, and (ii) the applicant has the right to conduct the operations as set forth in the application and operations plan.</p><p>F. A permit is required to drill any coalbed methane gas well or to convert any methane drainage borehole into a coalbed methane gas well.

The consent required by this subsection may be (i) contained in a lease or other such agreement; (ii) contained in an instrument of title; or (iii) in any case where a coal operator cannot be located or identified and the operator has complied with § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1618/'>45.2-1618</a>, provided by a pooling order entered pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1620/'>45.2-1620</a> or <a href='/vacode/45.2-1622/'>45.2-1622</a> if such order contains a finding that the operator has exercised due diligence in attempting to identify and locate the coal operator, contained in such order. The consent required by this subsection shall be deemed to be granted for any tract where title to the coal is held by multiple owners if the applicant has obtained consent to stimulate from the cotenants holding a majority interest in the tract and none of the coal cotenants has leased the tract for coal development. The requirement of signed consent contained in this subsection shall in no way be considered to impair, abridge, or affect any contractual rights or objections arising out of a coalbed methane gas contract or coalbed methane gas lease entered into prior to January 1, 1990, between the applicant and any coal operator or any extension or renewal thereto, and the existence of such lease or contractual arrangement and any extension or renewal thereto shall constitute a waiver of the requirement for the applicant to file an additional signed consent.</p><p>3. The unit map, if any, approved by the Board.</p><p>G. No permit that is required by this chapter for an activity to be conducted within an area of Tidewater Virginia where drilling is authorized under subsection B of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1646/'>45.2-1646</a> shall be granted until the environmental impact assessment required by § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1646/'>45.2-1646</a> has been conducted and the assessment has been reviewed by the Department.</p><p>H. The applicant for a permit for a gathering pipeline, oil or gas well, or coalbed methane well shall identify in the permit application any cemetery, as identified on a United States Geological Survey topographic map or located by routine field review, within 100 feet of the permitted activity.</p><p>I. The operator of any coalbed methane well drilled within 250 feet of a cemetery shall comply with a written request of any person owning an interest in a private cemetery or the authorized agent of a public cemetery that the operator of such well suspend operations for a period from two hours before to two hours after any burial service that takes place on the surface area of such cemetery. However, if the well operator or a mine operator determines that such suspension of operations will have an adverse effect on the safety of the well operations or mining operations, the operator shall be under no obligation to comply with the request, and operation of the well shall continue.</p><p>1982, c. 347, § 45.1-311; 1985, c. 601; 1987, c. 452; 1988, c. 160, § 45.1-311.1; 1990, cc. 92, 967, § 45.1-361.29; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0957'>957</a>; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0269'>269</a>; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0854'>854</a>; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0759'>759</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0229'>229</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0542'>542</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0550'>550</a>; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0227'>227</a>; 2021, Sp.

To ensure compliance with all laws and regulations pertaining to permitted activities and the furnishing of reports and other information required by the Board or Director, each permit applicant shall give bond with surety acceptable to the Director and payable to the Commonwealth. At the election of the permit applicant, a cash bond may be given. The amount of the bond required shall be sufficient to cover the costs of properly plugging the well and restoring the site but in no case shall the amount of the bond be less than $10,000 per well plus $2,000 per acre of disturbed land, calculated to the nearest tenth of an acre. Each bond shall remain in force until released by the Director. The Director may require additional bond or financial security for any well proposed to be drilled in Tidewater Virginia.</p><p>B. Upon receipt of an application for multiple permits for gas or oil operations and at the request of the permit applicant, the Director may, in lieu of requiring a separate bond for each permit, require a blanket bond. The amount of the blanket bond shall be as follows:</p><p>1. For one to 10 wells, $25,000.</p><p>2. For 11 to 50 wells, $50,000.</p><p>3. For 51 to 200 wells, $100,000.</p><p>4. For more than 200 wells, $200,000.</p><p>For purposes of calculating blanket bond amounts, from one-tenth of an acre to five acres of disturbed land for a separately permitted gathering pipeline shall be equivalent to one well. The Director shall adopt regulations for the release of acreage used to calculate blanket bond amounts for separately permitted gathering pipelines in cases where sites have been stabilized.</p><p>C. Any gas or oil operator who elects to post a blanket bond shall pay into the Gas and Oil Plugging and Restoration Fund those fees and assessments required under the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1634/'>45.2-1634</a>.</p><p>1990, c. 92, § 45.1-361.31; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0351'>351</a>; 2021, Sp.

There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Gas and Oil Plugging and Restoration Fund, referred to in this section as "the Fund." All payments made into the Fund by gas or oil operators, all collections of debt for expenditures made from the Fund, and all interest payments made into the Fund pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to the Fund. The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller and any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Director or his designee.</p><p>B. Each permittee operating under a blanket bond pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1633/'>45.2-1633</a> shall annually pay to the Fund an amount equal to $50 multiplied by the number of permits he then holds, such payment to be submitted with the annual report required under § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1640/'>45.2-1640</a>, until the payments and interest accruing to the Fund totals $100,000. Whenever the Director determines that the Fund's balance has fallen below $25,000 due to uncollectible debts, the Director shall assess a fee of $50 per permit per year on each permittee with a blanket bond until the Fund's balance once again reaches $100,000.</p><p>C. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purpose of supplementing bond proceeds in order to pay for the full cost of plugging and restoration in the event of a blanket bond forfeiture.</p><p>D. The amount by which the cost of plugging and restoration exceeds the amount of the gas or oil operator's forfeited bond shall constitute a debt of the operator to the Commonwealth. The Director is authorized to collect such debts together with the costs of collection through appropriate legal action. All moneys collected pursuant to this subsection, less the costs of collection, shall be deposited in the Fund.</p><p>E. No permit shall be issued to a gas or oil operator until he has fully reimbursed the Commonwealth for any debt incurred pursuant to the provisions of subsection D.</p><p>F. In the event of a discontinuance of the Fund, any amounts remaining in the Fund shall be returned to each gas or oil operator with a blanket bond in proportion to the number of permits under the blanket bond of each operator.</p><p>1990, c. 92, § 45.1-361.32; 2021, Sp.

Objections to a new permit or permit modification may be filed with the Director by any person having standing as set out in § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1632/'>45.2-1632</a>. Such objections shall be filed within 15 days of the objecting party's receipt of the notice required by § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1632/'>45.2-1632</a>. Any person objecting to a permit shall state the reasons for his objections.</p><p>B. The only objections to permits or permit modifications that may be raised by a surface owner are:</p><p>1. The operations plan for soil erosion and sediment control is not adequate or not effective;</p><p>2. Measures in addition to the requirement for a well's water-protection string are necessary to protect freshwater-bearing strata;</p><p>3. The permitted work will constitute a hazard to the safety of any person;</p><p>4. Location of the coalbed methane well or coalbed methane well pipeline will unreasonably infringe on the surface owner's use of the surface, so long as a reasonable alternative site is available within the unit and granting the objection will not materially impair any right contained in an agreement, valid at the time of the objection, between the surface owner and the operator or their predecessors or successors in interest; and</p><p>5. If the surface owner is an interstate park commission, the location of the well or pipeline will unreasonably infringe on the surface owner's use of the surface, so long as a reasonable alternative site is available within the unit and granting the objection will not materially impair any right contained in an agreement, valid at the time of the objection, between the surface owner and the operator or their predecessors or successors in interest.</p><p>C. The only objections to permits or permit modifications that may be raised by a royalty owner are that the proposed well work:</p><p>1. Directly impinges upon the royalty owner's gas and oil interest;</p><p>2. Threatens to violate the objecting royalty owner's property or statutory rights aside from his contractual rights; and</p><p>3. Would not adequately prevent the escape of the Commonwealth's gas and oil resources or provide for the accurate measurement of gas and oil production and delivery to the first point to sale.</p><p>D. Objections to permits or permit modifications may be raised by a coal owner or operator pursuant to the provisions of §§ <a href='/vacode/45.2-1611/'>45.2-1611</a> and <a href='/vacode/45.2-1612/'>45.2-1612</a>.</p><p>E. The only objections to permits or permit modifications that may be raised by a mineral owner are those that could be raised by a coal owner under § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1611/'>45.2-1611</a>, so long as the mineral owner makes the objection and affirmatively proves that it does in fact apply with equal force to the mineral in question.</p><p>F. The only objections to permits or permit modifications that may be raised by a gas storage field operator are those in which the gas storage operator affirmatively proves that the proposed well work will adversely affect the operation of his gas storage field certificated by the State Corporation Commission; however, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the owner of nonstorage strata from drilling a well for the purpose of producing oil or gas from any stratum above or below the storage stratum.</p><p>G. The Director shall fix a time and place for an informal fact-finding hearing concerning an objection filed pursuant to this section. The hearing shall be scheduled for not less than 20 nor more than 30 days after the objection is filed. The Director shall prepare a notice of the hearing, stating all objections and by whom each is made, and send a copy of such notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least 10 days prior to the hearing date to the permit applicant and to every person with standing to object as prescribed by § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1632/'>45.2-1632</a>.</p><p>H.

45.2|Mines, Minerals, and Energy|V|Other Sources of Energy; Energy Policy|||17|Other Sources of Energy Generally; Energy Policy|3|Energy Policy of the Commonwealth|||§ 45.2-1706.1| Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy.|<p>A. The Commonwealth recognizes that effectively addressing climate change and enhancing resilience will advance the health, welfare, and safety of the residents of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth further recognizes that addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the Commonwealth's economy sufficient to reach net-zero emission by 2045 in all sectors, including the electric power, transportation, industrial, agricultural, building, and infrastructure sectors. To achieve these objectives, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to:</p><p>1. Develop energy resources necessary to produce 30 percent of Virginia's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030 and 100 percent of Virginia's electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040;</p><p>2. Enable widespread integration of distributed energy resources, including energy storage and rooftop solar, into the grid to achieve decarbonization and to enhance resilience;</p><p>3. Support the distributed generation of renewable electricity by:</p><p>a. Encouraging private sector investments in distributed renewable energy;</p><p>b. Increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during a widespread power outage; and</p><p>c. Enhancing the ability of private property owners to generate their own renewable energy for their own personal use from renewable energy sources on their property;</p><p>4. Lead by example in state government by supporting the carbon-free energy resources required to fully decarbonize the electric power supply of the Commonwealth, including deploying 30 percent renewables by 2030, realizing 100 percent carbon-free electric power by 2040, and achieving net zero emissions by 2045;</p><p>5. Maximize energy efficiency programs as defined in § <a href='/vacode/56-576/'>56-576</a>, to the extent determined to be in the public interest, that are the lowest-cost energy option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in order to produce electricity cost savings and to create jobs and economic opportunity from the energy efficiency sector;</p><p>6. Support net-zero emission targets by promoting zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure, including electrified transport, decreasing the carbon intensity of the transportation sector, encouraging alternative transportation options, and increasing the efficiency of motor vehicles operating on Virginia's roads;</p><p>7. Support electric distribution grid transformation projects as defined in § <a href='/vacode/56-576/'>56-576</a>;</p><p>8. Promote building and construction practices that reduce emissions associated with built environment, including energy efficiency targets, new building standards, and transit-oriented and other sustainable development practices; and</p><p>9. Ensure that energy development projects avoid, minimize, and, if necessary, mitigate damage to the Commonwealth's natural and cultural resources.</p><p>B. The Commonwealth recognizes the need to promote environmental justice and ensure that it is carried out throughout the Commonwealth, as provided in § <a href='/vacode/2.2-235/'>2.2-235</a>, and the need to address and prevent energy inequities in historically economically disadvantaged communities, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/56-576/'>56-576</a>. To achieve these objectives, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to:</p><p>1. Recognize the disproportionate and inequitable impacts of climate change on historically economically disadvantaged communities and prioritize solutions and investment in these communities to maximize the benefits of clean energy and minimize the burdens of climate change;</p><p>2. Ensure the fair treatment and meaningful involvement, as those terms are defined in § <a href='/vacode/2.2-234/'>2.2-234</a>, of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, faith, disability, or income with respect to the administration of energy laws, regulations, and policies; and</p><p>3. Increase access to clean energy and the benefits from clean energy to historically economically disadvantaged communities.</p><p>C. As Virginia transforms its energy economy, the Commonwealth must continue to prioritize economic competiveness and workforce development in an equitable manner. To achieve this objective, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to:</p><p>1. Equitably incorporate requirements for technical, policy, and economic analyses and assessments that recognize the unique attributes of different energy resources and delivery systems to identify pathways to net-zero carbon that maximize Virginia's energy reliability and resilience, economic development, and jobs;</p><p>2. Require that pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions be determined on the basis of technical, policy, and economic analysis to maximize their effectiveness, optimize Virginia's economic development, support industrial employment, and create quality jobs while minimizing adverse impacts on public health, affected communities, and the environment;</p><p>3. Ensure an adequate energy supply and a Virginia-based energy production capacity, while also optimizing intrastate and interstate use of energy supply and delivery to maximize energy availability, reliability, and price opportunities to the benefit of all user classes and the Commonwealth's economy;</p><p>4.

Ensure the availability of reliable energy at costs that are reasonable and in quantities that will support the Commonwealth's economy;</p><p>6. Ensure reliable energy availability in the event of a disruption occurring to a portion of the Commonwealth's energy matrix and to address the needs of businesses during the transition to clean energy;</p><p>7. Minimize the Commonwealth's long-term exposure to volatility and increases in world energy prices by expanding the use of innovative clean energy technology within the Commonwealth;</p><p>8. Create training opportunities and green career pathways for local workers and workers in historically economically disadvantaged communities in onshore and offshore wind, solar energy, electrification, energy efficiency, clean transportation, and other emerging clean energy industries;</p><p>9. Support the repurposing and development of clean energy resources on previously developed project sites as defined in § <a href='/vacode/56-576/'>56-576</a>;</p><p>10. Ensure that decision making is transparent and includes opportunities for full participation by the public;</p><p>11. Explore approaches to maximizing and leveraging the capacity of lands and waters in the Commonwealth to store energy; and</p><p>12. Increase the Commonwealth's reliance on and production of sustainably produced biofuels made from traditional agricultural crops and other feedstocks, such as winter cover crops, warm season grasses, fast-growing trees, algae, or other suitable feedstocks grown in the Commonwealth, that will (i) create jobs and income, (ii) produce clean-burning fuels that will help to improve air quality, and (iii) provide the new markets for Virginia's silvicultural and agricultural products needed to preserve farm employment, conserve farmland and forestland, and increase implementation of silvicultural and agricultural best management practices to protect water quality.</p><p>D. The elements of the policy set forth in subsections A, B, and C shall be referred to collectively in this title as the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy.</p><p>E. All agencies and political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, in taking discretionary action with regard to energy issues, shall recognize the elements of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy and, where appropriate, shall act in a manner consistent therewith.</p><p>F. The Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy is intended to provide guidance to the agencies and political subdivisions of the Commonwealth in taking discretionary action with regard to energy issues and shall not be construed to amend, repeal, or override any contrary provision of applicable law. Nothing in this section shall preclude reliable access to electricity and natural gas during the transition to renewable energy.

The Division shall complete the Plan.</p><p>B. Prior to the completion of the Plan and each update thereof, the Division shall present drafts to, and consult with, the Virginia Coal and Energy Commission established pursuant to Chapter 25 (§ <a href='/vacode/30-188/'>30-188</a> et seq.) of Title 30 and the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation established pursuant to Chapter 31 (§ <a href='/vacode/30-201/'>30-201</a> et seq.) of Title 30.</p><p>C. The Plan shall be updated by the Division and submitted as provided in § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1713/'>45.2-1713</a> by October 1, 2014, and every fourth October 1 thereafter. In addition, the Division shall provide interim updates on the Plan by October 1 of the third year of each Governor's administration. Updated reports shall specify any progress attained toward each proposed action of the Plan, as well as reassess goals for energy conservation on the basis of progress to date in meeting the goals in the previous Plan and lessons learned from attempts to meet such goals.</p><p>D. Beginning with the Plan update in 2014, the Division shall include a section setting forth energy policy positions relevant to any potential regulations proposed or promulgated by the State Air Pollution Control Board to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under § 111(d) of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d). In such section of the Plan, the Division shall address policy options for establishing separate standards of performance pursuant to § 111(d) of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d), for carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units to promote the Plan's overall goal of fuel diversity as follows:</p><p>1. The Plan shall address policy options for establishing the standards of performance for existing coal-fired electric generating units, including the following factors:</p><p>a. The most suitable system of emission reduction that (i) takes into consideration (a) the cost and benefit of achieving such reduction, (b) any non-air quality health and environmental impacts, and (c) the energy requirements of the Commonwealth and (ii) has been adequately demonstrated for coal-fired electric generating units that are subject to the standard of performance;</p><p>b. Reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide that can be achieved through measures reasonably undertaken at each coal-fired electric generating unit; and</p><p>c. Increased efficiencies and other measures that can be implemented at each coal-fired electric generating unit to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the unit without converting from coal to other fuels, co-firing other fuels with coal, or limiting the utilization of the unit.</p><p>2. The Plan shall also address policy options for establishing the standards of performance for existing gas-fired electric generating units, including the following factors:</p><p>a. The application of the criteria specified in subdivisions 1 a and b to natural gas-fired electric generating units instead of to coal-fired electric generating units; and</p><p>b. Increased efficiencies and other measures that can be reasonably implemented at the unit to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the unit without switching from natural gas to other lower-carbon fuels or limiting the utilization of the unit.</p><p>3. The Plan shall examine policy options for state regulatory action to adopt less stringent standards or longer compliance schedules than those provided for in applicable federal rules or guidelines based on analysis of the following:</p><p>a. Consumer impacts, including any disproportionate impacts of energy price increases on lower-income populations;</p><p>b. Unreasonable cost of reducing emissions resulting from plant age, location, or basic process design;</p><p>c. Physical difficulties with or impossibility of implementing emission reduction measures;</p><p>d. The absolute cost of applying the performance standard to the unit;</p><p>e. The expected remaining useful life of the unit;</p><p>f. The economic impacts of closing the unit, including expected job losses, if the unit is unable to comply with the performance standard; and</p><p>g. Any other factors specific to the unit that make application of a less stringent standard or longer compliance schedule more reasonable.</p><p>4. The Plan shall identify options, to the maximum extent permissible, for any federally required regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and regulatory mechanisms that provide flexibility in complying with such standards, including the averaging of emissions, emissions trading, or other alternative implementation measures that are determined to further the interests of the Commonwealth and its citizens.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0939'>939</a>, § 67-202; 2008, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0651'>651</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0883'>883</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0161'>161</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0419'>419</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0603'>603</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0756'>756</a>; 2021, Sp.
