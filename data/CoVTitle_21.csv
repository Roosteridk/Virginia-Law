The district may borrow the full amount of the grant or reimbursement that the federal or state government is obligated to pay at the time the loan is issued.

No board shall refuse to service other premises of the owner not occupied by an occupant who is delinquent in the payment of such rates or charges on account of such delinquency provided that such owner has paid in full any delinquent charges for which he would be responsible for paying.
