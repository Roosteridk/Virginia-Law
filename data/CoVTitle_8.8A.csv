However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.</p><p>(c) An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:</p><p>(1) one year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or</p><p>(2) six months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date.</p><p>(d) A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:</p><p>(1) whether in bearer or registered form, has been endorsed "for collection" or "for surrender" or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or</p><p>(2) is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.</p><p>(e) Filing of a financing statement under Title 8.9A is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.</p><p>1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0216'>216</a>.</p>
