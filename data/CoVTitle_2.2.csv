2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|I|ORGANIZATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT|A|OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR|1|GOVERNOR|1|General Provisions|||§ 2.2-115|Commonwealth's Development Opportunity Fund.|<p>A. As used in this section, unless the context requires otherwise:</p><p>"New job" means employment of an indefinite duration, created as the direct result of the private investment, for which the firm pays the wages and standard fringe benefits for its employee, requiring a minimum of either (i) 35 hours of the employee's time a week for the entire normal year of the firm's operations, which "normal year" must consist of at least 48 weeks or (ii) 1,680 hours per year.</p><p>Seasonal or temporary positions, positions created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to the location of the economic development project, positions with suppliers, and multiplier or spin-off jobs shall not qualify as new jobs. The term "new job" shall include positions with contractors provided that all requirements included within the definition of the term are met.</p><p>"New teleworking job" means a new job that is held by a Virginia resident, for which the majority of the work is performed remotely, and that pays at least 1.2 times the Virginia minimum wage, as provided by the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§ <a href='/vacode/40.1-28.8/'>40.1-28.8</a> et seq.).</p><p>"Prevailing average wage" means that amount determined by the Virginia Employment Commission to be the average wage paid workers in the city or county of the Commonwealth where the economic development project is located. The prevailing average wage shall be determined without regard to any fringe benefits.</p><p>"Private investment" means the private investment required under this section.</p><p>B. There is created the Commonwealth's Development Opportunity Fund (the Fund) to be used by the Governor to attract economic development prospects and secure the expansion of existing industry in the Commonwealth. The Fund shall consist of any funds appropriated to it by the general appropriation act and revenue from any other source, public or private. The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller, and any funds remaining in the Fund at the end of a biennium shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Interest earned on the Fund shall be credited to the Fund. The Governor shall report to the Chairmen of the House Committees on Appropriations and Finance and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations as funds are awarded in accordance with this section.</p><p>C. Funds shall be awarded from the Fund by the Governor as grants or loans to political subdivisions. The criteria for making such grants or loans shall include (i) job creation, (ii) private capital investment, and (iii) anticipated additional state tax revenue expected to accrue to the state and affected localities as a result of the capital investment and jobs created. Loans shall be approved by the Governor and made in accordance with guidelines established by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and approved by the Comptroller. Loans shall be interest-free unless otherwise determined by the Governor and shall be repaid to the Fund. The Governor may establish the interest rate to be charged; otherwise, any interest charged shall be at market rates as determined by the State Treasurer and shall be indicative of the duration of the loan. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall be responsible for monitoring repayment of such loans and reporting the receivables to the Comptroller as required.</p><p>Beginning with the five fiscal years from fiscal year 2006-2007 through fiscal year 2010-2011, and for every five fiscal years' period thereafter, in general, no less than one-third of the moneys appropriated to the Fund in every such five-year period shall be awarded to counties and cities having an annual average unemployment rate that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for the calendar year that immediately precedes the calendar year of the award. However, if such one-third requirement will not be met because economic development prospects in such counties and cities are unable to fulfill the applicable minimum private investment and new jobs requirements set forth in this section, then any funds remaining in the Fund at the end of the five-year period that would have otherwise been awarded to such counties and cities shall be made available for awards in the next five fiscal years' period.</p><p>D. Funds may be used for public and private utility extension or capacity development on and off site; public and private installation, extension, or capacity development of high-speed or broadband Internet access, whether on or off site; road, rail, or other transportation access costs beyond the funding capability of existing programs; site acquisition; grading, drainage, paving, and any other activity required to prepare a site for construction; construction or build-out of publicly or privately owned buildings; training; or grants or loans to an industrial development authority, housing and redevelopment authority, or other political subdivision for purposes directly relating to any of the foregoing. However, in no case shall funds from the Fund be used, directly or indirectly, to pay or guarantee the payment for any rental, lease, license, or other contractual right to the use of any property.</p><p>It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth that moneys in the Fund shall not be used for any economic development project in which a business relocates or expands its operations in one or more Virginia localities and simultaneously closes its operations or substantially reduces the number of its employees in another Virginia locality, unless the procedures set forth in § <a href='/vacode/30-310/'>30-310</a> are followed. The Secretary of Commerce and Trade shall enforce this policy and for any exception thereto shall, pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/30-310/'>30-310</a>, submit such projects to the MEI Project Approval Commission established pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/30-309/'>30-309</a>.</p><p>E. 1. a. Except as provided in this subdivision, no grant or loan shall be awarded from the Fund unless the project involves a minimum private investment of $5 million and creates at least 50 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than the prevailing average wage. For projects, including but not limited to projects involving emerging technologies, for which the average wage of the new jobs created, excluding fringe benefits, is at least twice the prevailing average wage for that locality or region, the Governor shall have the discretion to require no less than one-half the number of new jobs as set forth for that locality in this subdivision.</p><p>b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, a grant or loan may be awarded from the Fund if the project involves a minimum private investment of $100 million and creates at least 25 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than the prevailing average wage.</p><p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1 a, in localities (i) with an annual unemployment rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for that calendar year or (ii) with a poverty rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that exceeds the statewide average poverty rate for that year, a grant or loan may be awarded from the Fund pursuant to subdivision 1 a if the project involves a minimum private investment of $2.5 million and creates at least 25 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage.</p><p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions 1 a and 2, in localities (i) with an annual unemployment rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for that calendar year and (ii) with a poverty rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that exceeds the statewide average poverty rate for that year, a grant or loan may be awarded from the Fund pursuant to such subdivisions if the project involves a minimum private investment of $1.5 million and creates at least 15 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage.</p><p>4. For projects that are eligible under subdivision 2 or 3, the average wage of the new jobs, excluding fringe benefits, shall be no less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage. In addition, for projects in such localities, the Governor may award a grant or loan for a project paying less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage but still providing customary employee benefits, only after the Secretary of Commerce and Trade has made a written finding that the economic circumstances in the area are sufficiently distressed (i.e., high unemployment or underemployment and negative economic forecasts) that assistance to the locality to attract the project is nonetheless justified. However, the minimum private investment and number of new jobs required to be created as set forth in this subsection shall still be a condition of eligibility for an award from the Fund. Such written finding shall promptly be provided to the chairs of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations and the House Committee on Appropriations.</p><p>5. A business beneficiary may count new teleworking jobs toward the minimum number of new jobs required under subdivision 1, 2, or 3, if so permitted in the contract required by subdivision F 2.</p><p>6. The minimum private investment required under subdivision 1, 2, or 3 may be reduced or waived if at least 75 percent, measured against the minimum number of new jobs required, of jobs created by the business beneficiary are new teleworking jobs, if so permitted in the contract required by subdivision F 2.</p><p>F. 1. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall assist the Governor in developing objective guidelines and criteria that shall be used in awarding grants or making loans from the Fund. The guidelines may require that as a condition of receiving any grant or loan incentive that is based on employment goals, a recipient company must provide copies of employer quarterly payroll reports that have been provided to the Virginia Employment Commission to verify the employment status of any position included in the employment goal. The guidelines may include a requirement for the affected locality or localities to provide matching funds which may be cash or in-kind, at the discretion of the Governor; however, if the minimum private investment is reduced or waived pursuant to subdivision E 6, the Governor may provide full or partial relief from such matching requirement. The guidelines and criteria shall include provisions for geographic diversity and a cap on the amount of funds to be provided to any individual project. At the discretion of the Governor, this cap may be waived for qualifying projects of regional or statewide interest. In developing the guidelines and criteria, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall use the measure for Fiscal Stress published by the Commission on Local Government of the Department of Housing and Community Development for the locality in which the project is located or will be located as one method of determining the amount of assistance a locality shall receive from the Fund.</p><p>2. a. Notwithstanding any provision in this section or in the guidelines, each political subdivision that receives a grant or loan from the Fund shall enter into a contract with the Commonwealth, through the Virginia Economic Development Partnership Authority as its agent, and each business beneficiary of funds from the Fund. A person or entity shall be a business beneficiary of funds from the Fund if grant or loan moneys awarded from the Fund by the Governor are paid to a political subdivision and (i) subsequently distributed by the political subdivision to the person or entity or (ii) used by the political subdivision for the benefit of the person or entity but never distributed to the person or entity.</p><p>b. The contract between the political subdivision, the Commonwealth, and the business beneficiary shall provide in detail (i) the fair market value of all funds that the Commonwealth has committed to provide, (ii) the fair market value of all matching funds (or in-kind match) that the political subdivision has agreed to provide, (iii) how funds committed by the Commonwealth (including but not limited to funds from the Fund committed by the Governor) and funds that the political subdivision has agreed to provide are to be spent, (iv) the minimum private investment to be made and the number of new jobs to be created agreed to by the business beneficiary, (v) the average wage (excluding fringe benefits) agreed to be paid in the new jobs, (vi) the prevailing average wage, and (vii) the formula, means, or processes agreed to be used for measuring compliance with the minimum private investment and new jobs requirements, including consideration of any layoffs instituted by the business beneficiary over the course of the period covered by the contract.</p><p>The contract shall state the date by which the agreed upon private investment and new job requirements shall be met by the business beneficiary of funds from the Fund and may provide for the political subdivision and the Commonwealth to grant up to a 15-month extension of such date if deemed appropriate by the political subdivision and the Commonwealth subsequent to the execution of the contract. Any extension of such date granted by the political subdivision shall be in writing and promptly delivered to the business beneficiary, and the political subdivision shall simultaneously provide a copy of the extension to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.</p><p>The contract shall provide that if the private investment and new job contractual requirements are not met by the expiration of the date stipulated in the contract, including any extension granted by the political subdivision and the Commonwealth, the business beneficiary shall be liable to the political subdivision and the Commonwealth for repayment of a portion of the funds provided by the political subdivision under the contract and liable to the Commonwealth for repayment of a portion of the funds provided from the Commonwealth's Development Opportunity Fund. The contract shall include a formula for purposes of determining the portion of such funds to be repaid. The formula shall, in part, be based upon the fair market value of all funds that have been provided by the Commonwealth and the political subdivision and the extent to which the business beneficiary has met the private investment and new job contractual requirements. All such funds repaid to the political subdivision or the Commonwealth that relate to the award from the Commonwealth's Development Opportunity Fund shall promptly be remitted to the State Treasurer. Upon receipt by the State Treasurer of such payment, the Comptroller shall deposit such repaid funds into the Commonwealth's Development Opportunity Fund.</p><p>c. The contract shall be amended to reflect changes in the funds committed by the Commonwealth or agreed to be provided by the political subdivision.</p><p>d. Notwithstanding any provision in this section or in the guidelines, whenever layoffs instituted by a business beneficiary over the course of the period covered by a contract cause the net total number of the new jobs created to be fewer than the number agreed to, then the business beneficiary shall return the portion of any funds received pursuant to the repayment formula established by the contract.</p><p>3. Notwithstanding any provision in this section or in the guidelines, prior to executing any such contract with a business beneficiary, the political subdivision shall provide a copy of the proposed contract to the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall review the proposed contract (i) for enforceability as to its provisions and (ii) to ensure that it is in appropriate legal form. The Attorney General shall provide any written suggestions to the political subdivision within seven days of his receipt of the copy of the contract. The Attorney General's suggestions shall be limited to the enforceability of the contract's provisions and the legal form of the contract.</p><p>4. Notwithstanding any provision in this section or in the guidelines, a political subdivision shall not expend, distribute, pledge, use as security, or otherwise use any award from the Fund unless and until such contract as described herein is executed with the business beneficiary.</p><p>G. Within the 30 days immediately following each quarter, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall provide a report to the Chairmen of the House Committees on Appropriations and Finance and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations which shall include, but is not limited to, the following information regarding grants and loans awarded from the Fund during the immediately preceding six-month period for economic development projects: the name of the company that is the business beneficiary of the grant or loan and the type of business in which it engages; the location (county, city, or town) of the project; the amount of the grant or loan committed from the Fund and the amount of all other funds committed by the Commonwealth from other sources and the purpose for which such grants, loans, or other funds will be used; the amount of all moneys or funds agreed to be provided by political subdivisions and the purposes for which they will be used; the number of new jobs agreed to be created by the business beneficiary; the amount of investment in the project agreed to be made by the business beneficiary; the timetable for the completion of the project and new jobs created; the prevailing average wage; and the average wage (excluding fringe benefits) agreed to be paid in the new jobs.</p><p>H. The Governor shall provide grants and commitments from the Fund in an amount not to exceed the dollar amount contained in the Fund. If the Governor commits funds for years beyond the fiscal years covered under the existing appropriation act, the State Treasurer shall set aside and reserve the funds the Governor has committed, and the funds shall remain in the Fund for those future fiscal years. No grant or loan shall be payable in the years beyond the existing appropriation act unless the funds are currently available in the Fund.</p><p>I. On a quarterly basis, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall notify the Governor, his campaign committee, and his political action committee of awards from the Fund made in the prior quarter. Within 18 months of the date of each award from the Fund, the Governor, his campaign committee, and his political action committee shall submit to the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council established in § <a href='/vacode/30-355/'>30-355</a> a report listing any contribution, gift, or other item with a value greater than $100 provided by the business beneficiary of such award to the Governor, his campaign committee, or his political action committee, respectively, during (i) the period in which the business beneficiary's application for such award was pending and (ii) the one-year period immediately after any such award was made.</p><p>J. 1. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Governor may give grants or loans to any eligible company, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/58.1-405.1/'>58.1-405.1</a>, provided that such company shall be required to distribute at least half of such grant or loan to its employees in jobs located in a qualified locality, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/58.1-405.1/'>58.1-405.1</a>. If the Governor gives a grant or loan pursuant to this subsection, it shall not be required to meet other provisions in this section, including provisions, restrictions, and procedural requirements related to job creation, investment, local matching funds, or contracts with business beneficiaries.</p><p>2. The grant or loan shall not exceed $2,000 per new job, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/58.1-405.1/'>58.1-405.1</a>; however, the Governor may give a new grant or loan each year to the same eligible company.</p><p>3. An eligible company's eligibility for or receipt of a grant or loan pursuant to this subsection shall not prevent it from receiving any other grant or loan for which it may be qualified pursuant to this section.</p><p>1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0590'>590</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0598'>598</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0859'>859</a>, § 2.1-51.6:5; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0787'>787</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0816'>816</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2006, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0251'>251</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0890'>890</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0654'>654</a>; 2010, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0078'>78</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0470'>470</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0580'>580</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0735'>735</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0768'>768</a>; 2011, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0539'>539</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0574'>574</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0587'>587</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0547'>547</a>; 2015, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0763'>763</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0777'>777</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0641'>641</a>; 2017, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0663'>663</a>; 2018, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0801'>801</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0802'>802</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0829'>829</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0591'>591</a>; 2021, Sp.

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|I|Organization of State Government|C|State Agencies Related to the General Operation of Government|6|General Provisions|2|IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL MANDATES ACT|||§ 2.2-616|Legislative declaration.|<p>A. In enacting this chapter, the General Assembly employs its legislative authority to establish that the people of Virginia, acting through their elected officials in Virginia government, have the responsibility and authority to establish policy in and for Virginia pertaining to federal programs mandated in federal statutes.</p><p>B. The intent of the General Assembly is to assure the primacy of the Commonwealth's legal and political authority to implement in and for Virginia the policy mandated by federal statutes and to vigorously challenge and scrutinize the extent and scope of authority asserted by federal executive branch agencies when federal agency actions and interpretations are inconsistent with Virginia policy and exceed the lawful authority of the federal government or are not required by federal law.</p><p>C. In this connection the General Assembly finds and declares that:</p><p>1. The power to implement federal policies in and for Virginia is central to the ability of the people of Virginia to govern themselves under a federal system of government; and</p><p>2. Any implementation of federal policies in and for Virginia by federal executive branch agencies that is contrary to fundamental notions of federalism and self-determination must be identified and countered.</p><p>D. The General Assembly further finds and declares that:</p><p>1. There is an urgent need to modify federal mandates because the implementation of these mandates by the Commonwealth wastes the financial resources of local governments, the citizens of Virginia and the Commonwealth and does not properly respect the rights of the Commonwealth, local governments, and citizens.</p><p>2. The state government has an obligation to the public to do what is necessary to protect the rights of Virginia citizens under federal law while minimizing or eliminating any additional cost or regulatory burden on any citizen of the Commonwealth.</p><p>3. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution directs that powers that are not delegated to the United States are reserved to the states or to the people. Virginia, as one of the sovereign states within the Union, has constitutional authority to enact laws protecting the environment of the Commonwealth and safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Virginia. However, this authority has too often been ignored by the federal government, as the federal government has intruded more and more into areas that must be left to the states. It is essential that the dilution of the authority of state and local governments be halted and that the provisions of the Tenth Amendment be accorded proper respect.</p><p>4. Current federal regulatory mandates, as reflected in federal administrative regulations, guidelines, and policies, often do not reflect the realities of Virginia and federal regulators frequently do not understand the needs and priorities of the citizens of Virginia.</p><p>5. The citizens of the Commonwealth can create and wish to create innovative solutions to Virginia's problems, but the current manner in which legal challenges to state policies and federal programmatic substitutions of state programs are handled does not allow the Commonwealth the flexibility it needs. It is not possible for the Commonwealth of Virginia to effectively and efficiently implement the provisions of federal statutes unless the burden to prove the insufficiency of the Commonwealth's efforts to implement federal requirements is shifted to the person or agency who asserts such insufficiency.</p><p>6. The provisions of this chapter will better balance the exercise of the powers of the federal government and the powers reserved to the states. In addition, the application of this chapter ultimately will bring about greater protection for the Commonwealth and the nation because it will direct the Commonwealth to implement federal statutes at the least possible cost, thereby freeing more moneys for other needs.</p><p>7. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that federal mandates implemented in Virginia comply with state policy as established by the General Assembly.</p><p>1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0604'>604</a>, § 2.1-796; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>.</p>

The Department shall identify real property assets that are surplus to the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Commonwealth and may dispose of surplus assets as provided in this section, except when a department, agency or institution notifies the Department of a need for property that has been declared surplus, and the Department finds that stated need to be valid and best satisfied by the use of the property.</p><p>B. After it determines the property to be surplus to the needs of the Commonwealth and that such property should be sold, the Department shall request the written opinion of the Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources as to whether the property is a significant component of the Commonwealth's natural or historic resources, and if so how those resources should be protected in the sale of the property. The Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources shall provide this review within 15 business days of receipt of full information from the Department.</p><p>C. Upon receipt of the Secretary's review under subsection B and prior to offering the surplus property for sale to the public, the Department shall notify the chief administrative officer of the locality within which the property is located as well as any economic development entity for such locality of the pending disposition of such property. The chief administrative officer or local economic development entity shall have up to 180 days from the date of such notification to submit a proposal to the Department for the use by the locality or the local economic development entity of such property in conjunction with a bona fide economic development activity. The Department shall review such proposal, and if the Department determines that such proposal is viable and could benefit the Commonwealth, the Department may negotiate with the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of such property to the locality or economic development entity. If no agreement is reached between the Department and the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of the property, or if no proposal for the use of the property is submitted to the Department by the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity within 180 days of notification of the pending disposition of the property, the Department, with the prior, written approval of the Governor, may proceed to dispose of the property as provided in this section.</p><p>D. If the surplus property is not disposed of pursuant to subsection C, the sale shall be by public auction, or sealed bids, or by marketing through one or more real estate brokers licensed by the Commonwealth. Notice of the date, time and place of sale, if by public auction or sealed bids shall be given by advertisement in at least one newspaper published and having general circulation in the county or city in which the property to be sold is located and be posted on the Department's website. At least 30 days shall elapse between publication of the notice and the auction or the date on which sealed bids will be opened.</p><p>E. The Department may reject any and all bids or offers when, in the opinion of the Department, the price is inadequate in relation to the value of the property, the proposed terms are unacceptable, or if a need has been found for the property.</p><p>F. In lieu of the sale of any such property, or in the event the Department determines there is space within a building owned by the Commonwealth or any space leased by the Commonwealth in excess of current and reasonably anticipated needs, the Department may, with the approval of the Governor, lease or sublease such property or space to any responsible person, firm or corporation on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided, however, that the authority herein to sublease space leased by the Commonwealth shall be subject to the terms of the original lease. The Department may with the approval of the Governor permit charitable organizations exempt from taxation under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that provide addiction recovery services to lease or sublease such property or space at cost and on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided such use is deemed appropriate.</p><p>The Department shall post reports from the Commonwealth's statewide electronic procurement system, known as eVA, on the Department's website. The report shall include, at a minimum, current leasing opportunities and sales of surplus real property posted on the eVA's Virginia Business Opportunities website. Such reports shall also be made available by electronic subscription. The provisions of this section requiring disposition of property through the medium of sealed bids, public auction, or marketing through licensed real estate brokers shall not apply to any lease thereof, although such procedures may be followed in the discretion of the Department.</p><p>G. The deed, lease, or sublease conveying the property or excess space shall be executed in the name of the Commonwealth and shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and notwithstanding how title to the property was acquired, the deed or lease may be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Director of the Department or his designee, and such action shall not create a cloud on the title to the property.</p><p>In the event that the Department determines that a boundary line of a surplus property requires adjustment, the Department may work with the adjacent landowner to adjust the boundary line and to transfer property to, or acquire property from, such adjacent landowner. In the event the Department determines that granting or accepting an easement over surplus property or the property of the adjacent landowner would facilitate the transfer of the surplus property, the Department may enter into any such easement on behalf of the department, agency, or institution in possession or control of the property, provided, however, that any such easement shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General and subject to the written approval of the Governor. The terms of the sale, lease, or sublease shall be subject to the written approval of the Governor.</p><p>H. An exception to sale by sealed bids, public auction, or listing the property with a licensed real estate broker may be granted by the Governor if the property is landlocked and inaccessible from a public road or highway. In such cases, the Department shall notify all adjacent landowners of the Commonwealth's desire to dispose of the property. After the notice has been given, the Department may begin negotiations for the sale of the property with each interested adjacent landowner. The Department, with the approval of the Governor, may accept any offer that it deems to be fair and adequate consideration for the property. In all cases, the offer shall be the best offer made by any adjacent landowner. The terms of all negotiations shall be public information.</p><p>I. Subject to any law to the contrary, 50 percent of the proceeds from all sales or leases, or from the conveyance of any interest in property under the provisions of this article, above the costs of the transaction, which costs shall include fees or commissions, if any, negotiated with and paid to auctioneers or real estate brokers, shall be paid into the State Park Acquisition and Development Fund, so long as the sales or leases pertain to general fund agencies or the property involved was originally acquired through the general fund, except as provided in Chapter 180 of the Acts of Assembly of 1966. The remaining 50 percent of proceeds involving general fund sales or leases, less a pro rata share of any costs of the transactions, shall be deposited in the general fund of the state treasury. The Department of Planning and Budget shall develop guidelines that allow, with the approval of the Governor, any portion of the deposit in the general fund to be credited to the agency, department or institution having control of the property at the time it was determined surplus to the Commonwealth's needs. Any amounts so credited to an agency, department or institution may be used, upon appropriation, to supplement maintenance reserve funds or capital project appropriations, or for the acquisition, construction or improvement of real property or facilities. Net proceeds from sales or leases of special fund agency properties or property acquired through a gift for a specific purpose shall be retained by the agency or used in accordance with the original terms of the gift. Notwithstanding the foregoing, income from leases or subleases above the cost of the transaction shall first be applied to rent under the original lease and to the cost of maintenance and operation of the property. The remaining funds shall be distributed as provided herein.</p><p>J. When the Department deems it to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, it may, with the approval of the Governor, authorize the department, institution or agency in possession or control of the property to dispose of surplus property in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.</p><p>1968, c. 717, § 2.1-106.7; 1970, c. 202; 1972, c. 763; 1977, c. 672, § 2.1-512; 1978, c. 545; 1981, c. 104; 1984, c. 641; 1989, c. 687; 1991, c. 679; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0399'>399</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0466'>466</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0281'>281</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0997'>997</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0612'>612</a>; 2011, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0659'>659</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0675'>675</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0291'>291</a>; 2018, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0825'>825</a>; 2019, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0659'>659</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0660'>660</a>; 2021, Sp.

Participation in such insurance plan or plans shall be (i) voluntary, (ii) approved by the participant's respective governing body, or by the local school board in the case of teachers, and (iii) subject to regulations adopted by the Department. In addition, at the option of a governing body or school board that has elected to participate in the health insurance plan or plans offered by the Department, the governing body or school board may elect to participate in the voluntary employee-pay-all long-term care program offered by the Commonwealth.</p><p>B.

The Department may engage the services of other professional advisors and vendors as necessary for the prudent administration of the plan or plans. The assets of the plan or plans, together with all appropriations, premiums, and other payments, shall be deposited in the employee health insurance fund, from which payments for claims, premiums, cost containment programs, and administrative expenses shall be withdrawn from time to time. The assets of the fund shall be held for the sole benefit of the employee health insurance fund. The fund shall be held in the state treasury. Any interest on unused balances in the fund shall revert back to the credit of the fund. The State Treasurer shall charge reasonable fees to recover the actual costs of investing the assets of the plan or plans.</p><p>In establishing the participation requirements, the Department may provide that those employees, officers, and teachers without access to employer-sponsored health care coverage may participate in the plan. It shall collect all premiums directly from the employers of such employees, officers, and teachers.</p><p>C. In the event that the financial reserves of the plan fall to an unacceptably low level as determined by the Department, it shall have the authority to secure from the State Treasurer a loan sufficient to raise the reserve level to one that is considered adequate. The State Treasurer may make such a loan, to be repaid on such terms and conditions as established by him.</p><p>D.

The Central Capital Planning Fund, the State Agency Capital Account, and the Public Educational Institution Capital Account established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1520/'>2.2-1520</a> shall be used to fund capital outlay projects included in the six-year capital outlay plan enacted into law.</p><p>2. In addition, public educational institutions and state agencies may request authority and appropriation to conduct pre-planning for any such project using nongeneral fund sources. Such costs may be reimbursed up to the lesser of $250,000 or one percent of the project construction costs.</p><p>B. A Virginia-based contractor who does not have the same number of years of comparable experience under construction management or design-build shall not be penalized for having less comparable experience in construction management or design-build projects, provided such contractor does have significant experience in constructing comparable projects under design-bid-build. The procuring entity shall consider the experience and quality of work that a contractor has done on projects comparable to the project being procured, whether under construction management, design-build, or design-bid-build. These factors shall be considered by the procuring entity in making its decisions in a pre-qualification or a contractor selection process.</p><p>C. If at any time during the detailed planning phase the total cost of a capital outlay project is estimated to exceed a threshold amount set forth in the general appropriation act for the required use of value engineering, then value engineering shall be utilized for such project. Each agency and public educational institution shall retain documentation of the value engineering process conducted for any project, including documentation relating to (i) recommendations offered to the agency or institution, (ii) recommendations accepted and rejected by the agency or institution, and (iii) any savings to the agency or institution resulting from the adoption of each recommendation.</p><p>D. For capital outlay projects for which an appropriation is made to the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, after an agency or public educational institution has received authorization to move to the construction phase of a project, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget shall transfer sufficient appropriation from the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, as appropriate.</p><p>E. 1. Prior to an agency or public educational institution awarding a construction contract for a project, the Director of the Department of General Services shall review the lowest bid or best proposal for the project. If the total amount of such bid or proposal, plus previously expended funds and a reasonable allowance for contingencies, does not exceed 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources for the project as determined during the detailed planning phase, the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget may approve the contract. If the total amount of such bid or proposal, plus previously expended funds and a reasonable allowance for contingencies, exceeds 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources for the project, the Directors shall not approve the contract unless funding of that portion of such total project cost in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project is from nongeneral fund sources such as private funds, gifts, grants, auxiliary funds, or federal funds as appropriate.</p><p>2. If an agency or public educational institution is unable to procure funding from nongeneral fund sources for that portion of such total project cost in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project, then the agency or institution may reduce the size or scope of the project as necessary to remain within 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project, provided that (i) it has completed a value engineering review by or in collaboration with the Department of General Services, (ii) it has provided a written, detailed analysis of the proposed reduction to the Governor and to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, and (iii) the project after such reduction in size or scope is substantially similar in quality and functionality to the original project.</p><p>3. An agency or public educational institution may request a supplemental allocation of general fund-supported resources through the budget process only if it submits a written certification to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, the Director of the Department of General Services, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget, and, for public institutions of higher education only, the Executive Director of the State Council of Higher Education, which certification (i) states that additional funding from nongeneral fund sources as described in subdivision 1 will be insufficient to pay for the full amount of the project cost that is in excess of 105 percent of the general fund-supported resources allocated to the project and (ii) provides a detailed analysis and description of the project as modified for a reduction in size or scope as described in subdivision 2 as well as a justification for why such modifications in size or scope cannot be achieved.</p><p>4. Nothing in this section shall preclude an agency or public educational institution from providing for re-design or additional value engineering of projects or re-bidding or re-submitting of proposals.</p><p>5. No construction contract for a capital outlay project included in the six-year capital outlay plan enacted into law shall be awarded unless first approved by the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget.</p><p>F. After a project has been approved by the Director of the Department of General Services and the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget, the Director of the Department of Planning and Budget shall transfer to the project the remaining funds needed for construction from the State Agency Capital Account or the Public Educational Institution Capital Account, as appropriate.</p><p>2008, Sp.

Such certification programs shall deny certification to vendors from states that deny like certifications to Virginia-based small, women-owned, or minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations or that provide a preference for small, women-owned, or minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations based in that state that is not available to Virginia-based businesses. The regulations shall (i) establish minimum requirements for certification of small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations; (ii) provide a process for evaluating existing local, state, and private sector certification programs that meet the minimum requirements; and (iii) mandate certification without any additional paperwork of any small, women-owned, or minority-owned business that has obtained (a) certification under any federal certification program or (b) certification under any other certification program that is determined to meet the minimum requirements established in the regulations, and of any employment services organization that has been approved by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. All employment services organization certifications shall remain in effect until the Department is notified by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services that such organization is no longer approved. The regulations shall also require as a prerequisite for approval that any out-of-state business applying for certification in Virginia as a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business have the equivalent certification in the business's state of origin. An out-of-state business located in a state that does not have a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business certification program shall be exempt from the requirements of this provision. The regulations shall establish a process for businesses that are denied initial certification as a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business to appeal such denial on the basis that the Department made a mistake in denying the business's application for certification.</p><p>9.

The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. The Fund shall consist of all moneys collected from the handling fee established by the Department pursuant to subsection G and such other funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it.

An advisory board, commission or council serves as a formal liaison between the agency or office and the public to ensure that the agency or office understands public concerns and that the activities of the agency or office are communicated to the public. An advisory board, commission or council does not serve a regulatory or rule-making purpose. It may participate in the development of public policy by providing comment and advice.</p><p>"Policy" -- A board, commission or council shall be classified as policy if it is specifically charged by statute to promulgate public policies or regulations. It may also be charged with adjudicating violations of those policies or regulations. Specific functions of the board, commission or council may include, but are not limited to, rate setting, distributing federal funds, and adjudicating regulatory or statutory violations, but each power shall be enumerated by law. Policy boards, commissions or councils are not responsible for supervising agencies or employing personnel. They may review and comment on agency budget requests.</p><p>"Supervisory" -- A board, commission, or council shall be classified as supervisory if it is responsible for agency operations including approval of requests for appropriations. A supervisory board, commission, or council appoints the agency director and ensures that the agency director complies with all board and statutory directives. The agency director is subordinate to the board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Education shall be considered a supervisory board.</p><p>B. Each executive branch board, commission or council shall be assigned only one of the above classifications. The classification for boards and councils that are created by law shall be designated by the enabling legislation. The classification for commissions that are created by executive order shall be designated by the executive order.</p><p>1985, c. 419, § 9-6.25; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, the "Virginia Retirement System" shall include any hybrid retirement program established under Title 51.1.</p><p>The following rules shall apply:</p><p>1. The Authority shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions to the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan for retirement and group life insurance in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (§ <a href='/vacode/51.1-124.1/'>51.1-124.1</a> et seq.) of Title 51.1 for any employee who elects to remain a member of the Virginia Retirement System or a statutory optional retirement plan.</p><p>2.

The actuarial present value shall be determined by using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used in determining the funding needs of the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan so that the transfer of assets to the Authority retirement plan will have no effect on the funded status and financial stability of the Virginia Retirement System or the statutory optional retirement plan. The Authority shall reimburse the Virginia Retirement System for the cost of actuarial services necessary to determine the present value of the accrued basic benefit of employees who transfer to an Authority retirement plan.</p><p>4. The Authority may provide that employees of the Authority who are eligible to participate in any deferred compensation plan sponsored by the Authority shall be enrolled automatically in such plan, unless such employee elects, in a manner prescribed by the Board of the Authority, not to participate. The amount of the deferral under the automatic enrollment and the group of employees to which the automatic enrollment shall apply shall be set by the Board, provided, however, that such employees are provided the opportunity to increase or decrease the amount of the deferral in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</p><p>E.

The Authority may make appropriations to any such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the Authority may require active and former employees covered by a postemployment benefit program to contribute to the trust or equivalent arrangement through payments or deductions from their wages, salaries, or pensions.</p><p>C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to inhibit the Authority's right to revise or discontinue its plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for its active and former officers and employees as it may deem necessary. If all plans or programs providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement is established are repealed or terminated by the Authority, then there shall be no continuing responsibility of the Authority to continue to make appropriations to such trust or equivalent arrangement, and the assets of such trust or equivalent arrangement shall be used to provide any benefits continuing to be due to active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) under such plans or programs. If there are no active or former employees (or dependents or beneficiaries) due a benefit under any plan or program providing such postemployment benefits other than pensions for which the trust or equivalent arrangement was established, then any remaining assets may revert to the Authority.</p><p>D. Postemployment benefits other than pensions shall be defined by the Authority pursuant to applicable accounting standards and law. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, hearing, life, or accident insurance (not provided through a pension plan), long-term care benefits, and long-term disability benefits (not covered under a pension plan) provided to individuals who have terminated their service and to the dependents of such individuals, and may be provided by purchasing insurance, by a program of self-insurance, or by a combination of both. However, postemployment benefits other than pensions shall not include defined benefit pension plans for retirees and eligible dependents of retirees, termination benefits, or other pension benefits. Such postemployment benefits other than pensions may be provided to the officers and employees or to their dependents, estates, or designated beneficiaries. Any benefits arising from any postemployment benefits other than pension programs shall be clearly defined and strictly construed.</p><p>E. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the moneys and other property comprising the trust or equivalent arrangement established hereunder shall be invested, reinvested, and managed by the Authority or the trust company or bank having powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth that is selected by the Board to act as a trustee for the trust or equivalent arrangement with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with the same aims. Such investments shall be diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. Such investments shall not be limited by Chapter 45 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4500/'>2.2-4500</a> et seq.).</p><p>2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0779'>779</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0817'>817</a>.</p>

The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. Bonds issued in registered form may be issued under a system of book-entry for recording the ownership and transfer of ownership of rights to receive payment of principal of, and premium on, if any, and interest on such bonds.

The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided in this article for such payment. Any bonds of the Authority issued pursuant to this article shall not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth, or any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority, and shall so state on their face. Neither the members of the Authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest, shall mature at such time not exceeding forty years from their date as determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price and under such terms and conditions as determined by the Authority, prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denominations of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it determines will best effect the purposes of this article.</p><p>The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in the manner and under the restrictions, if any, the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, is less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional projects.</p><p>Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this article without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things that are specifically required by this article.</p><p>1981, c. 569, § 2.1-234.14; 1998, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0498'>498</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0504'>504</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>.</p>

The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any project or any part thereof. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the acquisition, construction, establishment, improvement, extension, enlargement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the project in connection with which the bonds have been authorized, the rates and fees to be charged, the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish the indemnifying bonds or to pledge the securities required by the Authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority deems reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of a trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the project.</p><p>1981, c. 569, § 2.1-234.15; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>.</p>

Such rates, fees, and other charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth.

Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, the revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or of the trust agreement.

This article shall be known and may be cited as the Fort Monroe Authority Act.</p><p>B. The General Assembly finds and declares that:</p><p>1. Fort Monroe, located on a barrier spit at Hampton Roads Harbor and the southern end of Chesapeake Bay where the Old Point Comfort lighthouse has been welcoming ships since 1802, is one of the Commonwealth's most important cultural treasures. Strategically located near Virginia's Historic Triangle of Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown, the 565-acre site has been designated a National Historic Landmark District;</p><p>2. As a result of decisions made by the federal Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (known as the BRAC Commission), Fort Monroe will cease to be an army base in 2011, and at that time most of the site will revert to the Commonwealth;</p><p>3. The planning phase of Fort Monroe's transition from use as a United States Army base was managed by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority (FMFADA), originally established by the City of Hampton pursuant to legislation enacted by the General Assembly in 2007. The Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, a partnership between the City and the Commonwealth, has fulfilled its primary purpose of formulating a reuse plan for Fort Monroe;</p><p>4. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to protect the historic resources at Fort Monroe, provide public access to the Fort's historic resources and recreational opportunities, exercise exemplary stewardship of the Fort's natural resources, and maintain Fort Monroe in perpetuity as a place that is a desirable one in which to reside, do business, and visit, all in a way that is economically sustainable;</p><p>5. Fort Monroe's status is unique. Municipal services will need to be provided to Fort Monroe's visitors, residents, and businesses. Both the Commonwealth and the FMFADA are signatories to a Programmatic Agreement under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires several specific actions be taken, including the enforcement of design standards to be adopted by the FMFADA or its successor to govern any new development or building restoration or renovation at Fort Monroe. There exists a need for an entity that can manage the property for the Commonwealth and ensure adherence to the findings, declarations, and policies set forth in this section; and</p><p>6.

The amount of such fee shall be determined as follows: (i) all property in the Area of Operation shall be assessed as if privately owned; (ii) property that would not be taxed if located elsewhere in the City of Hampton by virtue of the ownership, control, or use of the property, other than property classified solely under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/58.1-3606/'>58.1-3606</a>, shall be excluded from the calculation of the fee in lieu of taxes; and (iii) the total assessed value, less any exemptions, shall then be divided by $100, multiplied by the then-current real estate tax rate set by the City of Hampton, minus the real estate taxes (a) owed to the City of Hampton directly from taxpayers other than the Authority within the Area of Operation, including lessees subject to taxation and billed to the lessee pursuant to subsection E, and (b) collected by the Authority and remitted to the City of Hampton pursuant to subsection E in the calendar year prior to the year for which the fee in lieu of taxes is then determined. The Authority may apply to the assessor of real estate for the City of Hampton and follow the process for recognition of an exemption applicable to other such properties in the City for any property subject to the fee in lieu of taxes, other than property subject to taxation and billed directly to the lessee pursuant to subsection E.</p><p>C. The Authority shall use all funds available and manage its finances and take all necessary and prudent actions to ensure that the fee in lieu of taxes provided in subsection B is paid when due and shall notify the City of Hampton and the Trustees as soon as practical if the funds will not be available to pay the fee in lieu of taxes when due and the Trustees shall take all necessary actions to remedy any deficiency. In the event the fee in lieu of taxes is not paid when due, interest thereon shall at that time accrue at the rate, not to exceed the maximum amount allowed by § <a href='/vacode/2.2-4355/'>2.2-4355</a>, determined by the City of Hampton until such time as the overdue payment and interest are paid. Unpaid fees in lieu of taxes and interest thereon shall rank in parity with liens for unpaid taxes and may be collected by the City of Hampton as taxes are collected; however, no real property of the Commonwealth or the Authority may be sold in such collection efforts.</p><p>D. The Authority shall have the right to contest the assessments made on property at Fort Monroe owned by the Commonwealth or the Authority or any property for which the Commonwealth or the Authority shall be responsible for payment of the fee in lieu of taxes, using the procedures utilized by other citizens of the City of Hampton, including appeals to the Board of Review of Real Estate Assessments for the City of Hampton and appeals therefrom to the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton, which is hereby granted jurisdiction to adjudicate any such appeal by the Authority in the same manner as applicable to private property owners or lessees in the City.</p><p>E. Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/58.1-3203/'>58.1-3203</a>, all real property in the Area of Operation that is leased, whether by short-term operating/revenue lease or long-term ground lease, shall be assessed as if it were privately owned, and each lessee thereof shall be subject to taxation to be billed and collected by the City of Hampton as if the lessee were the owner, regardless of the term; however, leases for a cumulative term of less than 20 years shall be billed to and collected from the Authority by the City of Hampton. For purposes of this subsection, "cumulative term" includes the original term plus any optional extensions or renewals of that term. The City of Hampton shall have no obligation to assess any leased property that may be subject to taxation pursuant to this subsection unless and until it has received from the Authority a complete and fully executed copy of the lease, which shall include a description of the property comparable to that which would be required for the fee simple conveyance of such leased property. Any property not assessed by the City of Hampton pursuant to this subsection shall remain subject to the provisions of subsection B. This subsection shall not apply to leases of any term with other government entities.</p><p>F. The Authority and any lessee that is directly billed by the City of Hampton (i) may apply to the assessor of real estate for the City of Hampton and follow the process for recognition of an exemption applicable to other such properties in the City and (ii) shall have the right to contest the assessments made on property taxed to the lessee pursuant to this section using the procedures utilized by other citizens of the City of Hampton, including appeals to the Board of Review of Real Estate Assessments for the City of Hampton and appeals therefrom to the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton, which is hereby granted jurisdiction to adjudicate any such appeal by a qualifying lessee in the same manner applicable to private property owners and other lessees in the City.</p><p>2011, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0716'>716</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0221'>221</a>; 2019, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0468'>468</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0469'>469</a>.</p>

The Board shall establish guidelines, procedures, and objective criteria for the award and distribution of grants from the Fund to regional councils.</p><p>B. In order to qualify to receive grants from the Fund, a regional council shall develop an economic growth and diversification plan to (i) promote private-sector growth and opportunity in the region; (ii) identify issues of economic competitiveness for the region, including gaps in education and skills required to meet existing and prospective employer needs within the region; and (iii) outline steps that the collaborating business, education, and government entities in the region will pursue to expand economic opportunity, diversify the economy, and align workforce development activities with the education and skills needed by employers in the region. A regional council shall review such plan not less than biennially while the regional council is receiving grants from the Fund.</p><p>C. The Board shall only consider those regional activities endorsed by a regional council in its application for grants from the Fund. For any regional activity included in a regional council's application, the regional council shall identify (i) the amount of grants requested and the number of years for which grants are sought; (ii) the participating business, education, and government entities and their respective roles and contributions; (iii) the private, local, and other sources of nonstate funding that the grant from the Fund will assist in generating, including specific amounts pledged by such sources as of the application date; (iv) how the regional activity addresses the skills gaps identified in the council's economic growth and diversification plan; and (v) the economic impact or other outcomes that are reasonably expected to result from the proposed regional activity, including timetables and means of measurement.</p><p>D. Regional activities eligible for grants from the Fund shall be focused on high-impact, collaborative projects in a region that promote new job creation, entrepreneurship, and new capital investment; leverage nonstate resources to enhance collaboration; foster research, development, and commercialization activities; encourage cooperation among public bodies to reduce costs and duplication of government services; and promote other economic or workforce development activities consistent with this article that are authorized by the Board. The Board shall give initial priority to grant proposals that promote workforce development and other activities focused on eliminating skills gaps identified in a region's economic growth and diversification plan.</p><p>E. In determining a regional council's eligibility to receive grants from the Fund, and the amount of such grants, the Board shall review and score the proposed regional activities. Scores shall be assigned on the basis of predetermined criteria established by the Board in its guidelines and procedures based on the following factors:</p><p>1. The expected economic impact or outcome of the activity, with particular emphasis on goals identified in the regional council's plan for economic growth and diversification;</p><p>2. The fiscal resources from non-Fund sources that will be committed to the activity, including local or federal funds, private contributions, and cost savings expected to be achieved through regional collaboration;</p><p>3. The number and percentage of localities, including political subdivisions and bodies corporate and politic, within the region that are participating in the activity, the portion of the region's population represented by the participating localities, and the participation of localities that are outside of the applicant region;</p><p>4. The compatibility with other projects, programs, or existing infrastructure in a region to maximize the leverage of grants from the Fund to encourage new collaborative activities;</p><p>5. The expected economic impact and outcomes of the project and the complexity of the project relative to the size of the economy of the region or to the population of the participating localities;</p><p>6. The projected cost savings and other efficiencies generated by the proposed activity, and the local resources generated by collaboration that have been or will be repurposed to support the activity;</p><p>7. The character of the regional collaboration, including the nature and extent of the regional effort involved in developing and implementing the proposed activity, the complexity of the activity, the prospective impact on relations between and among the affected localities, and the prospective impact on collaboration between and among business, education, and government entities in the region;</p><p>8. Interstate, inter-regional, and other beneficial forms of collaboration, if any, that will accompany, result from, or be encouraged by the activity;</p><p>9. Efficiency in the administration and oversight of regional activities; and</p><p>10. Other factors deemed to be appropriate by the Board.</p><p>F. Each regional council awarded a grant from the Fund shall issue an annual report that shall include, at a minimum, an assessment of the impact and outcomes from regional activities supported by grants from the Fund and the region's overall progress in addressing the goals and strategies identified in the region's plan for economic growth and diversification. Such assessment shall address performance criteria prescribed in the program guidelines and procedures.</p><p>G. Subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode//'></a><a href='/vacode/2.2-2488/'>2.2-2488</a> and this section, once a regional council becomes eligible for grants from the Fund, the regional council may continue to apply for and receive grants from the Fund to support economic activities consistent with the regional council's economic growth and diversification plan in such amounts and for such duration as the Board may determine in accordance with its guidelines and procedures. The Board may terminate any payments to regional councils that fail to perform in accordance with this article, the Board's guidelines or procedures, or any conditions expressly agreed upon as part of a grant award, or for malfeasance. The Board may require the refund of moneys from the Fund upon such termination. Grants that are terminated shall revert to the Fund for distribution on an unallocated competitive basis.</p><p>H. In making Fund recommendations and awards, the Board may consider regional activities that commenced prior to the enactment of this article, provided that the grant-funded program or project will expand the scope of, or increase the number of localities participating in, such preexisting activity.</p><p>I. No regional council may have outstanding grant commitments of more than 25 percent of the total amount appropriated to the Fund.</p><p>J. The year for grant payments shall be the Commonwealth's fiscal year following the calendar year in which the region qualifies, with payments made annually by the Comptroller upon certification by the Board. Grant amounts shall be made at the sole discretion of the Board.</p><p>K. (Effective until July 1, 2023) Any grant awarded from the Fund to a regional council shall require matching funds at least equal to the grant, provided, however, that the Board shall have the authority to reduce the match requirement to no less than half of the grant upon a finding by the Board of fiscal distress or an exceptional economic opportunity in a region. Such matching funds may be from local, regional, federal, or private funds. Matching funds may also be from grants awarded to a locality by the Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission but shall not include any other state general or nongeneral funds, from whatever source.</p><p>K. (Effective July 1, 2023) Any grant awarded from the Fund to a regional council shall require matching funds at least equal to the grant, provided, however, that the Board shall have the authority to reduce the match requirement to no less than half of the grant upon a finding by the Board of fiscal distress or an exceptional economic opportunity in a region. Such matching funds may be from local, regional, federal, or private funds, but shall not include any state general or nongeneral funds, from whatever source.</p><p>L.

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|I|Organization of State Government|E|State Officers and Employees|30|State Grievance Procedure|||||§ 2.2-3003|Grievance procedure generally.|<p>A. As part of the Commonwealth's program of employee relations management, the Department of Human Resource Management shall develop a grievance procedure that includes not more than three successively higher grievance resolution steps and a formal hearing as provided in this chapter. However, grievances involving dismissals due to formal discipline or unsatisfactory job performance shall proceed directly to a formal hearing, omitting the grievance resolution steps, the face-to-face meeting specified in subsection D, and the agency head qualification determination specified in subsection D of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3004/'>2.2-3004</a>.</p><p>B. Prior to initiating a written grievance, the employee shall be encouraged to pursue an informal complaint with his immediate supervisor. The supervisor shall have authority to resolve the complaint if it involves actions within his control.</p><p>C. An employee may pursue a formal written grievance through the grievance resolution steps if the complaint has been presented to management within 30 calendar days of the employee's knowledge of the event that gave rise to the complaint. Employees' rights to pursue grievances shall not be used to harass or otherwise impede the efficient operations of government.</p><p>D. Except as provided in subsection A, upon receipt of a timely written complaint, management shall review the grievance and respond to the merits thereof. Each level of management review shall have the authority to provide the employee with a remedy, subject to the agency head's approval. At least one face-to-face meeting between the employee and management shall be required. The persons who may be present at this meeting are the employee, the appropriate manager, an individual selected by the employee, and an individual selected by the manager. Witnesses may be called by either party.</p><p>E. Absent just cause, all documents, as defined in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, relating to the actions grieved shall be made available, upon request from a party to the grievance, by the opposing party, in a timely fashion. Upon such request a party shall have a duty to search its records to ensure that all such relevant documents are provided. Documents pertaining to nonparties that are relevant to the grievance shall be produced in such a manner as to preserve the privacy of the individuals not personally involved in the grievance. A party shall not be required to create a document if the document does not exist.</p><p>F. All time limitations prescribed in the grievance procedure, including, but not limited to, submission of an initial complaint and employee appeal of management decisions, shall be reasonable, specific, and equally applicable to the agency and the employee. Expedited grievance procedures shall be established for terminations, demotions, suspensions, and lost wages or salaries.</p><p>G. Within five workdays of the receipt of a written notice of noncompliance, failure of the employee or the agency to comply with a substantial procedural requirement of the grievance procedure without just cause may result in a decision against the noncomplying party on any qualified issue. Written notice of noncompliance by the agency shall be made to the agency head. The Director of the Department of Human Resource Management shall render all decisions related to procedural compliance, and such decisions shall contain the reasons for such decision and shall be final.</p><p>H. Grievances qualified pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3004/'>2.2-3004</a> that have not been resolved through the grievance resolution steps shall advance to a hearing that shall be the final step in the grievance procedure.</p><p>1995, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0770'>770</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0818'>818</a>, § 2.1-116.05; 1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0164'>164</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0869'>869</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0703'>703</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0726'>726</a>; 2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0947'>947</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1006'>1006</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0252'>252</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0674'>674</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0056'>56</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0349'>349</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0803'>803</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0835'>835</a>.</p>

The General Assembly finds that (i) the advent of the information age throughout the United States and around the world has resulted in lasting changes in information technology; (ii) use of interactive visual display terminals by state and state-assisted organizations is becoming a widespread means of access for employees and the public to obtain information available electronically, but nonvisual access, whether by speech, Braille, or other appropriate means has been overlooked in purchasing and deploying the latest information technology; (iii) presentation of electronic data solely in a visual format is a barrier to access by individuals who are blind or visually impaired, preventing them from participating on equal terms in crucial areas of life, such as education and employment; (iv) alternatives, including both software and hardware adaptations, have been created so that interactive control of computers and use of the information presented is possible by both visual and nonvisual means; and (v) the goals of the state in obtaining and deploying the most advanced forms of information technology properly include universal access so that the segments of society with particular needs (including individuals unable to use visual displays) will not be left out of the information age.</p><p>B. It is the policy of the Commonwealth that all covered entities shall conduct themselves in accordance with the following principles: (i) individuals who are blind or visually impaired have the right to full participation in the life of the Commonwealth, including the use of advanced technology that is provided by such covered entities for use by employees, program participants, and members of the general public, and (ii) technology purchased in whole or in part with funds provided by the Commonwealth to be used for the creation, storage, retrieval, or dissemination of information and intended for use by employees, program participants, and members of the general public shall be adaptable for access by individuals who are blind or visually impaired.

The affairs of government are not intended to be conducted in an atmosphere of secrecy since at all times the public is to be the beneficiary of any action taken at any level of government. Unless a public body or its officers or employees specifically elect to exercise an exemption provided by this chapter or any other statute, every meeting shall be open to the public and all public records shall be available for inspection and copying upon request. All public records and meetings shall be presumed open, unless an exemption is properly invoked.</p><p>The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote an increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities and afford every opportunity to citizens to witness the operations of government. Any exemption from public access to records or meetings shall be narrowly construed and no record shall be withheld or meeting closed to the public unless specifically made exempt pursuant to this chapter or other specific provision of law. This chapter shall not be construed to discourage the free discussion by government officials or employees of public matters with the citizens of the Commonwealth.</p><p>All public bodies and their officers and employees shall make reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with a requester concerning the production of the records requested.</p><p>Any ordinance adopted by a local governing body that conflicts with the provisions of this chapter shall be void.</p><p>1968, c. 479, § 2.1-340; 1976, c. 467, § 2.1-340.1; 1989, c. 358; 1990, c. 538; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0703'>703</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0726'>726</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0393'>393</a>.</p>

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|ADMINISTRATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT|B|TRANSACTION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS|37|VIRGINIA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT|||||§ 2.2-3704|Public records to be open to inspection; procedure for requesting records and responding to request; charges; transfer of records for storage, etc.|<p>A. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all public records shall be open to citizens of the Commonwealth, representatives of newspapers and magazines with circulation in the Commonwealth, and representatives of radio and television stations broadcasting in or into the Commonwealth during the regular office hours of the custodian of such records. Access to such records shall be provided by the custodian in accordance with this chapter by inspection or by providing copies of the requested records, at the option of the requester. The custodian may require the requester to provide his name and legal address. The custodian of such records shall take all necessary precautions for their preservation and safekeeping.</p><p>B. A request for public records shall identify the requested records with reasonable specificity. The request need not make reference to this chapter in order to invoke the provisions of this chapter or to impose the time limits for response by a public body. Any public body that is subject to this chapter and that is the custodian of the requested records shall promptly, but in all cases within five working days of receiving a request, provide the requested records to the requester or make one of the following responses in writing:</p><p>1. The requested records are being entirely withheld. Such response shall identify with reasonable particularity the volume and subject matter of withheld records, and cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the withholding of the records.</p><p>2. The requested records are being provided in part and are being withheld in part. Such response shall identify with reasonable particularity the subject matter of withheld portions, and cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the withholding of the records.</p><p>3. The requested records could not be found or do not exist. However, if the public body that received the request knows that another public body has the requested records, the response shall include contact information for the other public body.</p><p>4. It is not practically possible to provide the requested records or to determine whether they are available within the five-work-day period. Such response shall specify the conditions that make a response impossible. If the response is made within five working days, the public body shall have an additional seven work days or, in the case of a request for criminal investigative files pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/2.2-3706.1/'>2.2-3706.1</a>, 60 work days in which to provide one of the four preceding responses.</p><p>C. Any public body may petition the appropriate court for additional time to respond to a request for records when the request is for an extraordinary volume of records or requires an extraordinarily lengthy search, and a response by the public body within the time required by this chapter will prevent the public body from meeting its operational responsibilities. Before proceeding with the petition, however, the public body shall make reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with the requester concerning the production of the records requested.</p><p>D. Subject to the provisions of subsection G, no public body shall be required to create a new record if the record does not already exist. However, a public body may abstract or summarize information under such terms and conditions as agreed between the requester and the public body.</p><p>E. Failure to respond to a request for records shall be deemed a denial of the request and shall constitute a violation of this chapter.</p><p>F. Except with regard to scholastic records requested pursuant to subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/2.2-3705.4/'>2.2-3705.4</a> that must be made available for inspection pursuant to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232g) and such requests for scholastic records by a parent or legal guardian of a minor student or by a student who is 18 years of age or older, a public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested records and shall make all reasonable efforts to supply the requested records at the lowest possible cost. No public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the public body. Any duplicating fee charged by a public body shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication. The public body may also make a reasonable charge for the cost incurred in supplying records produced from a geographic information system at the request of anyone other than the owner of the land that is the subject of the request. However, such charges shall not exceed the actual cost to the public body in supplying such records, except that the public body may charge, on a pro rata per acre basis, for the cost of creating topographical maps developed by the public body, for such maps or portions thereof, which encompass a contiguous area greater than 50 acres. Prior to conducting a search for records, the public body shall notify the requester in writing that the public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for requested records and inquire of the requester whether he would like to request a cost estimate in advance of the supplying of the requested records. The public body shall provide the requester with a cost estimate if requested. The period within which the public body shall respond under this section shall be tolled for the amount of time that elapses between notice of the cost estimate and the response of the requester. If the public body receives no response from the requester within 30 days of sending the cost estimate, the request shall be deemed to be withdrawn. Any costs incurred by the public body in estimating the cost of supplying the requested records shall be applied toward the overall charges to be paid by the requester for the supplying of such requested records.</p><p>G. Public records maintained by a public body in an electronic data processing system, computer database, or any other structured collection of data shall be made available to a requester at a reasonable cost, not to exceed the actual cost in accordance with subsection F. When electronic or other databases are combined or contain exempt and nonexempt records, the public body may provide access to the exempt records if not otherwise prohibited by law, but shall provide access to the nonexempt records as provided by this chapter.</p><p>Public bodies shall produce nonexempt records maintained in an electronic database in any tangible medium identified by the requester, including, where the public body has the capability, the option of posting the records on a website or delivering the records through an electronic mail address provided by the requester, if that medium is used by the public body in the regular course of business. No public body shall be required to produce records from an electronic database in a format not regularly used by the public body. However, the public body shall make reasonable efforts to provide records in any format under such terms and conditions as agreed between the requester and public body, including the payment of reasonable costs. The excision of exempt fields of information from a database or the conversion of data from one available format to another shall not be deemed the creation, preparation, or compilation of a new public record.</p><p>H. In any case where a public body determines in advance that charges for producing the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the public body may, before continuing to process the request, require the requester to pay a deposit not to exceed the amount of the advance determination. The deposit shall be credited toward the final cost of supplying the requested records. The period within which the public body shall respond under this section shall be tolled for the amount of time that elapses between notice of the advance determination and the response of the requester.</p><p>I. Before processing a request for records, a public body may require the requester to pay any amounts owed to the public body for previous requests for records that remain unpaid 30 days or more after billing.</p><p>J. In the event a public body has transferred possession of public records to any entity, including but not limited to any other public body, for storage, maintenance, or archiving, the public body initiating the transfer of such records shall remain the custodian of such records for purposes of responding to requests for public records made pursuant to this chapter and shall be responsible for retrieving and supplying such public records to the requester. In the event a public body has transferred public records for storage, maintenance, or archiving and such transferring public body is no longer in existence, any public body that is a successor to the transferring public body shall be deemed the custodian of such records. In the event no successor entity exists, the entity in possession of the public records shall be deemed the custodian of the records for purposes of compliance with this chapter, and shall retrieve and supply such records to the requester. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply to records transferred to the Library of Virginia for permanent archiving pursuant to the duties imposed by the Virginia Public Records Act (§ <a href='/vacode/42.1-76/'>42.1-76</a> et seq.). In accordance with § <a href='/vacode/42.1-79/'>42.1-79</a>, the Library of Virginia shall be the custodian of such permanently archived records and shall be responsible for responding to requests for such records made pursuant to this chapter.</p><p>1968, c. 479, § 2.1-342;

However, no student shall have access to (i) financial records of a parent or guardian or (ii) records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel and educational personnel ancillary thereto, that are in the sole possession of the maker thereof and that are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a substitute.</p><p>The parent or legal guardian of a student may prohibit, by written request, the release of any individual information regarding that student until the student reaches the age of 18 years. For scholastic records of students under the age of 18 years, the right of access may be asserted only by his legal guardian or parent, including a noncustodial parent, unless such parent's parental rights have been terminated or a court of competent jurisdiction has restricted or denied such access. For scholastic records of students who are emancipated or attending a public institution of higher education in the Commonwealth, the right of access may be asserted by the student.</p><p>Any person who is the subject of any scholastic record and who is 18 years of age or older may waive, in writing, the protections afforded by this subdivision.

Individual members of a public body may use remote participation instead of attending a public meeting in person if, in advance of the public meeting, the public body has adopted a policy as described in subsection D and the member notifies the public body chair that:</p><p>1. The member has a temporary or permanent disability or other medical condition that prevents the member's physical attendance;</p><p>2.

No closed meeting shall be held unless the public body proposing to convene such meeting has taken an affirmative recorded vote in an open meeting approving a motion that (i) identifies the subject matter, (ii) states the purpose of the meeting as authorized in subsection A of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3711/'>2.2-3711</a> or other provision of law and (iii) cites the applicable exemption from open meeting requirements provided in subsection A of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3711/'>2.2-3711</a> or other provision of law. The matters contained in such motion shall be set forth in detail in the minutes of the open meeting. A general reference to the provisions of this chapter, the authorized exemptions from open meeting requirements, or the subject matter of the closed meeting shall not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements for holding a closed meeting.</p><p>B. The notice provisions of this chapter shall not apply to closed meetings of any public body held solely for the purpose of interviewing candidates for the position of chief administrative officer. Prior to any such closed meeting for the purpose of interviewing candidates, the public body shall announce in an open meeting that such closed meeting shall be held at a disclosed or undisclosed location within 15 days thereafter.</p><p>C. The public body holding a closed meeting shall restrict its discussion during the closed meeting only to those matters specifically exempted from the provisions of this chapter and identified in the motion required by subsection A.</p><p>D. At the conclusion of any closed meeting, the public body holding such meeting shall immediately reconvene in an open meeting and shall take a roll call or other recorded vote to be included in the minutes of that body, certifying that to the best of each member's knowledge (i) only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements under this chapter and (ii) only such public business matters as were identified in the motion by which the closed meeting was convened were heard, discussed or considered in the meeting by the public body. Any member of the public body who believes that there was a departure from the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii), shall so state prior to the vote, indicating the substance of the departure that, in his judgment, has taken place. The statement shall be recorded in the minutes of the public body.</p><p>E. Failure of the certification required by subsection D to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the public body present during a meeting shall not affect the validity or confidentiality of such meeting with respect to matters considered therein in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The recorded vote and any statement made in connection therewith, shall upon proper authentication, constitute evidence in any proceeding brought to enforce the provisions of this chapter.</p><p>F. A public body may permit nonmembers to attend a closed meeting if such persons are deemed necessary or if their presence will reasonably aid the public body in its consideration of a topic that is a subject of the meeting.</p><p>G. A member of a public body shall be permitted to attend a closed meeting held by any committee or subcommittee of that public body, or a closed meeting of any entity, however designated, created to perform the delegated functions of or to advise that public body. Such member shall in all cases be permitted to observe the closed meeting of the committee, subcommittee or entity. In addition to the requirements of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3707/'>2.2-3707</a>, the minutes of the committee or other entity shall include the identity of the member of the parent public body who attended the closed meeting.</p><p>H.

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|ADMINISTRATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT|B|TRANSACTION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS|37|VIRGINIA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT|||||§ 2.2-3713|Proceedings for enforcement of chapter.|<p>A. Any person, including the attorney for the Commonwealth acting in his official or individual capacity, denied the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter may proceed to enforce such rights and privileges by filing a petition for mandamus or injunction, supported by an affidavit showing good cause. Such petition may be brought in the name of the person notwithstanding that a request for public records was made by the person's attorney in his representative capacity. Venue for the petition shall be addressed as follows:</p><p>1. In a case involving a local public body, to the general district court or circuit court of the county or city from which the public body has been elected or appointed to serve and in which such rights and privileges were so denied;</p><p>2. In a case involving a regional public body, to the general district or circuit court of the county or city where the principal business office of such body is located; and</p><p>3. In a case involving a board, bureau, commission, authority, district, institution, or agency of the state government, including a public institution of higher education, or a standing or other committee of the General Assembly, to the general district court or the circuit court of the residence of the aggrieved party or of the City of Richmond.</p><p>B. In any action brought before a general district court, a corporate petitioner may appear through its officer, director or managing agent without the assistance of counsel, notwithstanding any provision of law or Rule of Supreme Court of Virginia to the contrary.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-644/'>8.01-644</a>, the petition for mandamus or injunction shall be heard within seven days of the date when the same is made, provided the party against whom the petition is brought has received a copy of the petition at least three working days prior to filing. However, if the petition or the affidavit supporting the petition for mandamus or injunction alleges violations of the open meetings requirements of this chapter, the three-day notice to the party against whom the petition is brought shall not be required. The hearing on any petition made outside of the regular terms of the circuit court of a locality that is included in a judicial circuit with another locality or localities shall be given precedence on the docket of such court over all cases that are not otherwise given precedence by law.</p><p>D. The petition shall allege with reasonable specificity the circumstances of the denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter. A single instance of denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter shall be sufficient to invoke the remedies granted herein. If the court finds the denial to be in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the petitioner shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs, including costs and reasonable fees for expert witnesses, and attorney fees from the public body if the petitioner substantially prevails on the merits of the case, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust. In making this determination, a court may consider, among other things, the reliance of a public body on an opinion of the Attorney General or a decision of a court that substantially supports the public body's position.</p><p>E. In any action to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the public body shall bear the burden of proof to establish an exclusion by a preponderance of the evidence. No court shall be required to accord any weight to the determination of a public body as to whether an exclusion applies. Any failure by a public body to follow the procedures established by this chapter shall be presumed to be a violation of this chapter.</p><p>F. Failure by any person to request and receive notice of the time and place of meetings as provided in § <a href='/vacode/2.2-3707/'>2.2-3707</a> shall not preclude any person from enforcing his rights and privileges conferred by this chapter.</p><p>1968, c. 479, § 2.1-346; 1976, c. 709; 1978, c. 826; 1989, c. 358; 1990, c. 217; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0578'>578</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0703'>703</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0726'>726</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0560'>560</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0634'>634</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0299'>299</a>; 2011, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0133'>133</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0783'>783</a>; 2016, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0620'>620</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0716'>716</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0531'>531</a>.</p>

This chapter may be cited as the "Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act."</p><p>B. The General Assembly finds that:</p><p>1. An individual's privacy is directly affected by the extensive collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information;</p><p>2. The increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the harm that can occur from these practices;</p><p>3. An individual's opportunities to secure employment, insurance, credit, and his right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain of these personal information systems; and</p><p>4. In order to preserve the rights guaranteed a citizen in a free society, legislation is necessary to establish procedures to govern information systems containing records on individuals.</p><p>C. Recordkeeping agencies of the Commonwealth and political subdivisions shall adhere to the following principles of information practice to ensure safeguards for personal privacy:</p><p>1. There shall be no personal information system whose existence is secret.</p><p>2. Information shall not be collected unless the need for it has been clearly established in advance.</p><p>3. Information shall be appropriate and relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected.</p><p>4. Information shall not be obtained by fraudulent or unfair means.</p><p>5. Information shall not be used unless it is accurate and current.</p><p>6. There shall be a prescribed procedure for an individual to learn the purpose for which information has been recorded and particulars about its use and dissemination.</p><p>7. There shall be a clearly prescribed and uncomplicated procedure for an individual to correct, erase or amend inaccurate, obsolete or irrelevant information.</p><p>8. Any agency holding personal information shall assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent its misuse.</p><p>9. There shall be a clearly prescribed procedure to prevent personal information collected for one purpose from being used or disseminated for another purpose unless such use or dissemination is authorized or required by law.</p><p>10. The Commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision thereof shall not collect personal information except as explicitly or implicitly authorized by law.</p><p>1976, c. 597, §§ 2.1-377, 2.1-378; 1987, c. 506; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0791'>791</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0914'>914</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0918'>918</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0927'>927</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0849'>849</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0867'>867</a>; 2018, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0597'>597</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0679'>679</a>.</p>

Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this chapter, or that any person or group of persons has been denied any of the rights granted by this chapter and such denial raises an issue of general public importance, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in the appropriate circuit court for appropriate relief.</p><p>B. In such civil action, the court may:</p><p>1. Award such preventive relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person responsible for a violation of this chapter, as is necessary to assure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this chapter.</p><p>2. Assess a civil penalty against the respondent (i) in an amount not exceeding $50,000 for a first violation and (ii) in an amount not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation. Such civil penalties are payable to the Literary Fund.</p><p>3. Award a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p><p>C. The court or jury may award such other relief to the aggrieved person as the court deems appropriate, including compensatory damages and punitive damages.</p><p>D. Upon timely application, any person may intervene in a civil action commenced by the Attorney General under subsection A that involves an alleged discriminatory practice pursuant to this chapter with respect to which such person is an aggrieved person.

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|Administration of State Government|B|Transaction of Public Business|39|Virginia Human Rights Act|||||§ 2.2-3907|Procedures for a charge of unlawful discrimination; notice; investigation; report; conciliation; notice of the right to file a civil action; temporary relief.|<p>A. Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice may file a complaint in writing under oath or affirmation with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Law (the Office ). The Office itself or the Attorney General may in a like manner file such a complaint. The complaint shall be in such detail as to substantially apprise any party properly concerned as to the time, place, and facts surrounding the alleged unlawful discrimination.</p><p>B. Upon perfection of a complaint filed pursuant to subsection A, the Office shall timely serve a charge on the respondent and provide all parties with a notice informing the parties of the complainant's rights, including the right to commence a civil action, and the dates within which the complainant may exercise such rights. In the notice, the Office shall notify the complainant that the charge of unlawful discrimination will be dismissed with prejudice and with no right to further proceed if a written complaint is not timely filed with the appropriate general district or circuit court.</p><p>C. The complainant and respondent may agree to voluntarily submit the charge to mediation without waiving any rights that are otherwise available to either party pursuant to this chapter and without incurring any obligation to accept the result of the mediation process. Nothing occurring in mediation shall be disclosed by the Office or admissible in evidence in any subsequent proceeding unless the complainant and the respondent agree in writing that such disclosure be made.</p><p>D. Once a charge has been issued, the Office shall conduct an investigation sufficient to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged discrimination occurred. Such charge shall be the subject of a report made by the Office. The report shall be a confidential document subject to review by the Attorney General, authorized Office employees, and the parties. The review shall state whether there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed.</p><p>E. If the report on a charge of discrimination concludes that there is no reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed, the charge shall be dismissed and the complainant shall be given notice of his right to commence a civil action.</p><p>F. If the report on a charge of discrimination concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed, the complainant and respondent shall be notified of such determination and the Office shall immediately endeavor to eliminate any alleged unlawful discriminatory practice by informal methods such as conference, conciliation, and persuasion. When the Office determines that further endeavor to settle a complaint by conference, conciliation, and persuasion is unworkable and should be bypassed, the Office shall issue a notice that the case has been closed and the complainant shall be given notice of his right to commence a civil action.</p><p>G. At any time after a notice of charge of discrimination is issued, the Office or complainant may petition the appropriate court for temporary relief, pending final determination of the proceedings under this section, including an order or judgment restraining the respondent from doing or causing any act that would render ineffectual an order that a court may enter with respect to the complainant. Whether it is brought by the Office or by the complainant, the petition shall contain a certification by the Office that the particular matter presents exceptional circumstances in which irreparable injury will result from unlawful discrimination in the absence of temporary relief.</p><p>H. Upon receipt of a written request from the complainant, the Office shall promptly issue a notice of the right to file a civil action to the complainant after (i) 180 days have passed from the date the complaint was filed or (ii) the Office determines that it will be unable to complete its investigation within 180 days from the date the complaint was filed.</p><p>2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1140'>1140</a>; 2021, Sp.

An aggrieved person who has been provided a notice of his right to file a civil action pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/2.2-3907/'>2.2-3907</a> may commence a timely civil action in an appropriate general district or circuit court having jurisdiction over the person who allegedly unlawfully discriminated against such person in violation of this chapter.</p><p>B. If the court or jury finds that unlawful discrimination has occurred, the court or jury may award to the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, compensatory and punitive damages and the court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs and may grant as relief any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice, or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.</p><p>C. Upon timely application, the Attorney General may intervene in such civil action if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance. Upon intervention, the Attorney General may obtain such relief as would be available to a private party under subsection B.</p><p>2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1140'>1140</a>.</p>

No employer shall:</p><p>1. Refuse to make reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a person related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer.</p><p>a. In determining whether an accommodation would constitute an undue hardship on the employer, the following shall be considered:</p><p>(1) Hardship on the conduct of the employer's business, considering the nature of the employer's operation, including composition and structure of the employer's workforce;</p><p>(2) The size of the facility where employment occurs; and</p><p>(3) The nature and cost of the accommodations needed.</p><p>b. The fact that the employer provides or would be required to provide a similar accommodation to other classes of employees shall create a rebuttable presumption that the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.</p><p>2. Take adverse action against an employee who requests or uses a reasonable accommodation pursuant to this section. As used in this subdivision, "adverse action" includes failure to reinstate any such employee to her previous position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, seniority, and other benefits when her need for a reasonable accommodation ceases.</p><p>3. Deny employment or promotion opportunities to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee because such employer will be required to make reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of such applicant or employee related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.</p><p>4. Require an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided to the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of such employee.</p><p>C. Each employer shall engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with an employee who has requested an accommodation pursuant to this section to determine if the requested accommodation is reasonable and, if such accommodation is determined not to be reasonable, discuss alternative accommodations that may be provided.</p><p>D. An employer shall post in a conspicuous location and include in any employee handbook information concerning an employee's rights to reasonable accommodation for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Such information shall also be directly provided to (i) new employees upon commencement of their employment and (ii) any employee within 10 days of such employee's providing notice to the employer that she is pregnant.</p><p>E. An employee or applicant who has been denied any of the rights afforded under subsection B may bring an action in a general district or circuit court having jurisdiction over the employer that allegedly denied such rights. Any such action shall be brought within two years from the date of the unlawful denial of rights, or, if the employee or applicant has filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Law or a local human rights or human relations agency or commission within two years of the unlawful denial of rights, such action shall be brought within 90 days from the date that the Office or a local human rights or human relations agency or commission has rendered a final disposition on the complaint.</p><p>If the court or jury finds that an unlawful denial of rights afforded under subsection B has occurred, the court or jury may award to the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, compensatory damages, back pay, and other equitable relief. The court may also award reasonable attorney fees and costs and may grant as relief any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice, or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.</p><p>F.

In addition to determining the public benefit, the Department of Planning and Budget in coordination with the agency shall, within 45 days, prepare an economic impact analysis of the proposed regulation, as follows:</p><p>1. The economic impact analysis shall include but need not be limited to the projected number of businesses or other entities to which the regulation would apply; the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected by the regulation; the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected; the impact of the regulation on the use and value of private property, including additional costs related to the development of real estate for commercial or residential purposes; and the projected costs to affected businesses, localities, or entities of implementing or complying with the regulations, including the estimated fiscal impact on such localities and sources of potential funds to implement and comply with such regulation.

The Department shall revise and reissue its economic impact analysis within the time limits set forth for the Department's review of regulations at the final stage pursuant to the Governor's executive order for executive branch review if any of the following conditions is present that would materially change the Department's analysis:</p><p>1. Public comment timely received at the proposed stage indicates significant errors in the economic impact analysis; or</p><p>2. There is significant or material difference between the agency's proposed economic impact analysis and the anticipated negative economic impacts to the business community as indicated by public comment.</p><p>The determination of whether a condition is present under this subsection shall be made by the Department and shall not be subject to judicial review.</p><p>2007, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0316'>316</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0561'>561</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0873'>873</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0916'>916</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0608'>608</a>; 2017, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0483'>483</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0493'>493</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0599'>599</a>.</p>

Agencies may also adopt emergency regulations in situations in which Virginia statutory law or the appropriation act or federal law or federal regulation requires that a regulation be effective in 280 days or less from its enactment and the regulation is not exempt under the provisions of subdivision A 4 of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4006/'>2.2-4006</a>. In such cases, the agency shall state in writing the nature of the emergency and of the necessity for such action and may adopt the regulations.

During the 18-month period, an agency may issue additional emergency regulations as needed addressing the subject matter of the initial emergency regulation, but any such additional emergency regulations shall not be effective beyond the 18-month period from the effective date of the initial emergency regulation. If the agency wishes to continue regulating the subject matter governed by the emergency regulation beyond the 18-month limitation, a regulation to replace the emergency regulation shall be promulgated in accordance with this article. The Notice of Intended Regulatory Action to promulgate a replacement regulation shall be filed with the Registrar within 60 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation and published as soon as practicable, and the proposed replacement regulation shall be filed with the Registrar within 180 days after the effective date of the emergency regulation and published as soon as practicable.</p><p>D. In the event that an agency concludes that despite its best efforts a replacement regulation cannot be adopted before expiration of the 18-month period described in subsection C, it may seek the prior written approval of the Governor to extend the duration of the emergency regulation for a period of not more than six additional months. Any such request must be submitted to the Governor at least 30 days prior to the scheduled expiration of the emergency regulation and shall include a description of the agency's efforts to adopt a replacement regulation together with the reasons that a replacement regulation cannot be adopted before the scheduled expiration of the emergency regulation. Upon approval of the Governor, provided such approval occurs prior to the scheduled expiration of the emergency regulation, the duration of the emergency regulation shall be extended for a period of no more than six months. Such approval shall be in the sole discretion of the Governor and shall not be subject to judicial review. Agencies shall notify the Registrar of Regulations of the new expiration date of the emergency regulation as soon as practicable.</p><p>E.

In all such formal proceedings the parties shall be entitled to be accompanied by and represented by counsel, to submit oral and documentary evidence and rebuttal proofs, to conduct such cross-examination as may elicit a full and fair disclosure of the facts, and to have the proceedings completed and a decision made with dispatch. The burden of proof shall be upon the proponent or applicant. The presiding officers at the proceedings may (i) administer oaths and affirmations, (ii) receive probative evidence, exclude irrelevant, immaterial, insubstantial, privileged, or repetitive proofs, rebuttal, or cross-examination, rule upon offers of proof, and oversee a verbatim recording of the evidence, (iii) hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues by consent, (iv) dispose of procedural requests, and (v) regulate and expedite the course of the hearing.

The request for a summary case decision shall be in writing, signed by or on behalf of the requestor, and be submitted to the agency secretary as defined by the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The request shall include:</p><p>1. A statement that no material facts are in dispute;</p><p>2. A proposed stipulation of all such undisputed material facts concerning the application or notice;</p><p>3. A clear and concise statement of the questions of law to be decided by summary case decision; and</p><p>4. A statement that the requestor waives his right to any other administrative proceeding provided in this article by the agency on the questions of law to be decided by summary case decision.</p><p>B. Within 21 days of receipt of a complete request for summary case decision, the agency shall determine whether the matter in dispute properly may be decided by summary case decision and shall promptly notify the requestor of its determination in writing. If a request for summary case decision is not complete, the agency may request additional specific information from the requestor. The agency shall decide the matter by summary case decision if it determines that there are no disputed issues of material fact. However, if (i) an informal fact-finding proceeding as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4019/'>2.2-4019</a>, a formal hearing as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4020/'>2.2-4020</a>, or other proceeding authorized by the agency's basic law concerning the application or notice has been scheduled, the requestor has been notified, and the issues that are the subject of such proceeding or hearing include questions that are the subject of the request for summary case decision or (ii) the matter must be decided through any public participation requirements under this chapter or the agency's basic law, the agency shall not be required to decide the matter by summary case decision.</p><p>C. Denial of a request for summary case decision shall not be subject to judicial review in accordance with this chapter and the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and shall not prejudice any rights the requestor has or may have under this chapter or the agency's basic law. Nothing in this article shall prevent an agency from consolidating the summary case decision proceeding into, or proceeding with, a separate informal fact-finding proceeding, formal hearing, or other proceeding authorized by the agency's basic law concerning the matter in question.</p><p>D. Upon granting a request for summary case decision, the agency shall establish a schedule for the parties to submit briefs on the questions of law in dispute and may, by agreement of the parties, provide for oral argument.</p><p>E. All decisions or recommended decisions shall be served on the requestor, become a part of the record, and briefly state or recommend the findings, conclusions, reasons, or basis therefor upon the evidence contained in the record and relevant to the basic law under which the agency is operating, together with the appropriate order, license, grant of benefits, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0702'>702</a>.</p>

A party may file a petition for reconsideration of an agency's final decision made pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4020/'>2.2-4020</a>. The petition shall be filed with the agency not later than 15 days after service of the final decision and shall state the specific grounds on which relief is requested. The petition shall contain a full and clear statement of the facts pertaining to the reasons for reconsideration, the grounds in support thereof, and a statement of the relief desired. A timely filed petition for reconsideration shall not suspend the execution of the agency decision nor toll the time for filing a notice of appeal under Rule 2A:2 of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, unless the agency provides for suspension of its decision when it grants a petition for reconsideration. The failure to file a petition for reconsideration shall not constitute a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies.</p><p>B. The agency shall render a written decision on a party's timely petition for reconsideration within 30 days from receipt of the petition for reconsideration. Such decision shall (i) deny the petition, (ii) modify the case decision, or (iii) vacate the case decision and set a new hearing for further proceedings. The agency shall state the reasons for its action.</p><p>C. If reconsideration is sought for the decision of a policy-making board of an agency, such board may (i) consider the petition for reconsideration at its next regularly scheduled meeting; (ii) schedule a special meeting to consider and decide upon the petition within 30 days of receipt; or (iii) notwithstanding any other provision of law, delegate authority to consider the petition to either the board chairman, a subcommittee of the board, or the director of the agency that provides administrative support to the board, in which case a decision on the reconsideration shall be rendered within 30 days of receipt of the petition by the board.</p><p>D. Denial of a petition for reconsideration shall not constitute a separate case decision and shall not on its own merits be subject to judicial review. It may, however, be considered by a reviewing court as part of any judicial review of the case decision itself.</p><p>E. The agency may reconsider its final decision on its own initiative for good cause within 30 days of the date of the final decision. An agency may develop procedures for reconsideration of its final decisions on its own initiative.</p><p>F. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, (i) any agency may promulgate regulations that specify the scope of evidence that may be considered by such agency in support of any petition for reconsideration and (ii) any agency that has statutory authority for reconsideration in its basic law may respond to requests in accordance with such law.</p><p>2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0694'>694</a>.</p>

Any hearing officer empowered by the agency to provide a recommendation or conclusion in a case decision matter shall render that recommendation or conclusion as follows:</p><p>1. If the agency's written regulations or procedures require the hearing officer to render a recommendation or conclusion within a specified time period, the hearing officer shall render the recommendation or conclusion on or before the expiration of the specified period; and</p><p>2. In all other cases, the hearing officer shall render the recommendation or conclusion within 90 days from the date of the case decision proceeding or from a later date agreed to by the named party and the agency.</p><p>If the hearing officer does not render a decision within the time required by this subsection, then the agency or the named party to the case decision may provide written notice to the hearing officer and the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court that a decision is due. If no decision is made within 30 days from receipt by the hearing officer of the notice, then the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court shall remove the hearing officer from the hearing officer list and report the hearing officer to the Virginia State Bar for possible disciplinary action, unless good cause is shown for the delay.</p><p>E. The Executive Secretary shall remove hearing officers from the list, upon a showing of cause after written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. When there is a failure by a hearing officer to render a decision as required by subsection D, the burden shall be on the hearing officer to show good cause for the delay. Decisions to remove a hearing officer may be reviewed by a request to the Executive Secretary for reconsideration, followed by judicial review in accordance with this chapter.</p><p>F. This section shall not apply to hearings conducted by (i) any commission or board where all of the members, or a quorum, are present; (ii) the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, the State Corporation Commission, the Virginia Employment Commission, the Department of Motor Vehicles under Title 46.2 (§ <a href='/vacode/46.2-100/'>46.2-100</a> et seq.), § 58.1-2409, or Chapter 27 (§ <a href='/vacode/58.1-2700/'>58.1-2700</a> et seq.) of Title 58.1, or the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board under Chapter 15 (§ <a href='/vacode/46.2-1500/'>46.2-1500</a> et seq.) of Title 46.2; or (iii) any panel of a health regulatory board convened pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/54.1-2400/'>54.1-2400</a>, including any panel having members of a relevant advisory board to the Board of Medicine.

An individual who has served as investigator, prosecutor, or advocate at any stage in a contested case or who is subject to the authority, direction, or discretion of an individual who has served as investigator, prosecutor, or advocate at any stage in a contested case may not serve as the presiding officer or hearing officer in the same case. An agency head who has participated in a determination of probable cause or other preliminary determination in an adjudication may serve as the presiding officer in the adjudication unless a party demonstrates grounds for disqualification under subsection B.</p><p>B. A presiding officer or hearing officer is subject to disqualification for any factor that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the presiding officer or hearing officer, which may include bias, prejudice, financial interest, or ex parte communications; however, the fact that a hearing officer is employed by an agency as a hearing officer, without more, is not grounds for disqualification. The presiding officer or hearing officer, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to the parties all known facts related to grounds for disqualification that are material to the impartiality of the presiding officer or hearing officer in the proceeding. The presiding officer or hearing officer may self-disqualify and withdraw from any case for reasons listed in this subsection.</p><p>C. A party may petition for the disqualification of the presiding officer or hearing officer promptly after notice that the person will preside or, if later, promptly on discovering facts establishing a ground for disqualification. The petition must state with particularity the ground on which it is claimed that a fair and impartial hearing cannot be accorded or the applicable rules of ethics that require disqualification. The petition may be denied if the party fails to promptly request disqualification after discovering a ground for disqualification.</p><p>D. A presiding officer not appointed pursuant to the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4024/'>2.2-4024</a>, whose disqualification is requested shall decide whether to grant the petition and state in a record the facts and reasons for the decision. The decision to deny disqualification by a hearing officer appointed pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4024/'>2.2-4024</a> shall be reviewable according to the procedure set forth in subsection C of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4024/'>2.2-4024</a>. In all other circumstances, the presiding officer's or hearing officer's decision to deny disqualification is subject to judicial review in accordance with this chapter, but is not otherwise subject to interlocutory review.</p><p>2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0636'>636</a>.</p>

A hearing officer may communicate with any person on ministerial matters about a pending formal hearing conducted in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4020/'>2.2-4020</a> if the communication does not augment, diminish, or modify the evidence in the record.</p><p>C.

If a communication prohibited by this section is made, the hearing officer shall notify all parties of the prohibited communication and permit the parties to respond not later than 15 days after the notice is given. For good cause, the hearing officer may permit additional evidence in response to the prohibited communication.</p><p>E. If necessary to eliminate any prejudicial effect of a communication made that is prohibited by this section, a hearing officer may (i) be disqualified under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4024.1/'>2.2-4024.1</a>; (ii) seal the parts of the record pertaining to the communication by protective order; or (iii) grant other appropriate relief, including an adverse ruling on the merits of the case.</p><p>2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0478'>478</a>.</p>

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|Administration of State Government|B|Transaction of Public Business|43|Virginia Public Procurement Act|1|General Provisions|||§ 2.2-4300|Short title; purpose; declaration of intent.|<p>A. This chapter may be cited as the Virginia Public Procurement Act.</p><p>B. The purpose of this chapter is to enunciate the public policies pertaining to governmental procurement from nongovernmental sources, to include governmental procurement that may or may not result in monetary consideration for either party. This chapter shall apply whether the consideration is monetary or nonmonetary and regardless of whether the public body, the contractor, or some third party is providing the consideration.</p><p>C. To the end that public bodies in the Commonwealth obtain high quality goods and services at reasonable cost, that all procurement procedures be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any impropriety or appearance of impropriety, that all qualified vendors have access to public business and that no offeror be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded, it is the intent of the General Assembly that competition be sought to the maximum feasible degree, that procurement procedures involve openness and administrative efficiency, that individual public bodies enjoy broad flexibility in fashioning details of such competition, that the rules governing contract awards be made clear in advance of the competition, that specifications reflect the procurement needs of the purchasing body rather than being drawn to favor a particular vendor, and that the purchaser and vendor freely exchange information concerning what is sought to be procured and what is offered. Public bodies may consider best value concepts when procuring goods and nonprofessional services, but not construction or professional services. The criteria, factors, and basis for consideration of best value and the process for the consideration of best value shall be as stated in the procurement solicitation.</p><p>1982, c. 647, § 11-35; 1983, c. 593; 1984, c. 764; 1986, cc. 149, 212, 559; 1994, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0661'>661</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0918'>918</a>; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0018'>18</a>; 1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0683'>683</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP1019'>1019</a>; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0085'>85</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0488'>488</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0785'>785</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0861'>861</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0863'>863</a>; 1998, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0121'>121</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0132'>132</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0230'>230</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0248'>248</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0735'>735</a>; 2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0029'>29</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0382'>382</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0400'>400</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0642'>642</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0644'>644</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0666'>666</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0703'>703</a>; 2001, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0392'>392</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0409'>409</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0736'>736</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0753'>753</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0774'>774</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>.</p>

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|Administration of State Government|B|Transaction of Public Business|43|Virginia Public Procurement Act|1|General Provisions|||§ 2.2-4302.2|Process for competitive negotiation.|<p>A. The process for competitive negotiation shall include the following:</p><p>1. Issuance of a written Request for Proposal indicating in general terms that which is sought to be procured, specifying the factors that will be used in evaluating the proposal, indicating whether a numerical scoring system will be used in evaluation of the proposal, and containing or incorporating by reference the other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any unique capabilities, specifications or qualifications that will be required. Except with regard to contracts for architectural, professional engineering, transportation construction, or transportation-related construction services, a public body may include as a factor that will be used in evaluating a proposal the proposer's employment of persons with disabilities to perform the specifications of the contract. In the event that a numerical scoring system will be used in the evaluation of proposals, the point values assigned to each of the evaluation criteria shall be included in the Request for Proposal or posted at the location designated for public posting of procurement notices prior to the due date and time for receiving proposals. No Request for Proposal for construction authorized by this chapter shall condition a successful offeror's eligibility on having a specified experience modification factor;</p><p>2. Public notice of the Request for Proposal at least 10 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals by posting on the Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website or other appropriate websites. Public bodies may also publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the contract is to be performed so as to provide reasonable notice to the maximum number of offerors that can be reasonably anticipated to submit proposals in response to the particular request. Posting on the Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website shall be required of (i) any state public body and (ii) any local public body if such local public body elects not to publish notice of the Request for Proposal in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the contract is to be performed. Local public bodies are encouraged to utilize the Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website to provide the public with centralized visibility and access to the Commonwealth's procurement opportunities. In addition, proposals may be solicited directly from potential contractors. Any additional solicitations shall include certified businesses selected from a list made available by the Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity; and</p><p>3. For goods, nonprofessional services, and insurance, selection shall be made of two or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on the basis of the factors involved in the Request for Proposal, including price if so stated in the Request for Proposal. In the case of a proposal for information technology, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/2.2-2006/'>2.2-2006</a>, a public body shall not require an offeror to state in a proposal any exception to any liability provisions contained in the Request for Proposal. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so selected. The offeror shall state any exception to any liability provisions contained in the Request for Proposal in writing at the beginning of negotiations, and such exceptions shall be considered during negotiation. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole or primary determining factor. After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the public body shall select the offeror which, in its opinion, has made the best proposal and provides the best value, and shall award the contract to that offeror. When the terms and conditions of multiple awards are so provided in the Request for Proposal, awards may be made to more than one offeror. Should the public body determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror; or</p><p>4. For professional services, the public body shall engage in individual discussions with two or more offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. The offerors shall be encouraged to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project, as well as alternative concepts. In addition, offerors shall be informed of any ranking criteria that will be used by the public body in addition to the review of the professional competence of the offeror. The Request for Proposal shall not, however, request that offerors furnish estimates of man-hours or cost for services. At the discussion stage, the public body may discuss nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including, but not limited to, life-cycle costing, and where appropriate, nonbinding estimates of price for services. In accordance with § <a href='/vacode/2.2-4342/'>2.2-4342</a>, proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. For architectural or engineering services, the public body shall not request or require offerors to list any exceptions to proposed contractual terms and conditions, unless such terms and conditions are required by statute, regulation, ordinance, or standards developed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/2.2-1132/'>2.2-1132</a>, until after the qualified offerors are ranked for negotiations. At the conclusion of discussion, outlined in this subdivision, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the Request for Proposal and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the public body shall select in the order of preference two or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious.</p><p>Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the public body can be negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable and pursuant to contractual terms and conditions acceptable to the public body, the award shall be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations with the offeror ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the Request for Proposal, a public body may award contracts to more than one offeror.</p><p>Should the public body determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror.</p><p>B. Multiphase professional services contracts satisfactory and advantageous to the completion of large, phased, or long-term projects may be negotiated and awarded based on a fair and reasonable price for the first phase only, where the completion of the earlier phases is necessary to provide information critical to the negotiation of a fair and reasonable price for succeeding phases. Prior to entering into any such contract, the public body shall (i) state the anticipated intended total scope of the project and (ii) determine in writing that the nature of the work is such that the best interests of the public body require awarding the contract.</p><p>For the purposes of subdivision A 1, "experience modification factor" means a value assigned to an employer as determined by a rate service organization in accordance with its uniform experience rating plan required to be filed pursuant to subsection D of § <a href='/vacode/38.2-1913/'>38.2-1913</a>.</p><p>2013, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0518'>518</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0540'>540</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0543'>543</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0583'>583</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0217'>217</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0630'>630</a>; 2015, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0350'>350</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0570'>570</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0760'>760</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0776'>776</a>; 2016, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0174'>174</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0175'>175</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0295'>295</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0362'>362</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0754'>754</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0274'>274</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1158'>1158</a>.</p>

The contractor does not have sufficient financial ability to perform the contract that would result from such procurement. If a bond is required to ensure performance of a contract, evidence that the contractor can acquire a surety bond from a corporation included on the United States Treasury list of acceptable surety corporations in the amount and type required by the public body shall be sufficient to establish the financial ability of the contractor to perform the contract resulting from such procurement;</p><p>2.

The contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of prior construction contracts with a public body without good cause. If the public body has not contracted with a contractor in any prior construction contracts, the public body may deny prequalification if the contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of comparable construction contracts with another public body without good cause. A public body may not utilize this provision to deny prequalification unless the facts underlying such substantial noncompliance were documented in writing in the prior construction project file and such information relating thereto given to the contractor at that time, with the opportunity to respond;</p><p>5.

It is the intent of the General Assembly, in accordance with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193, to authorize public bodies to enter into contracts with faith-based organizations for the purposes described in this section on the same basis as any other nongovernmental source without impairing the religious character of such organization, and without diminishing the religious freedom of the beneficiaries of assistance provided under this section.</p><p>B. For the purposes of this section, "faith-based organization" means a religious organization that is or applies to be a contractor to provide goods or services for programs funded by the block grant provided pursuant to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193.</p><p>C. Public bodies, in procuring goods or services, or in making disbursements pursuant to this section, shall not (i) discriminate against a faith-based organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or (ii) impose conditions that (a) restrict the religious character of the faith-based organization, except as provided in subsection F, or (b) impair, diminish, or discourage the exercise of religious freedom by the recipients of such goods, services, or disbursements.</p><p>D. Public bodies shall ensure that all invitations to bid, requests for proposals, contracts, and purchase orders prominently display a nondiscrimination statement indicating that the public body does not discriminate against faith-based organizations.</p><p>E. A faith-based organization contracting with a public body (i) shall not discriminate against any recipient of goods, services, or disbursements made pursuant to a contract authorized by this section on the basis of the recipient's religion, religious belief, or refusal to participate in a religious practice or on the basis of race, age, color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin and (ii) shall be subject to the same rules as other organizations that contract with public bodies to account for the use of the funds provided; however, if the faith-based organization segregates public funds into separate accounts, only the accounts and programs funded with public funds shall be subject to audit by the public body. Nothing in clause (ii) shall be construed to supersede or otherwise override any other applicable state law.</p><p>F. Consistent with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193, funds provided for expenditure pursuant to contracts with public bodies shall not be spent for religious worship, instruction, or proselytizing; however, this prohibition shall not apply to expenditures pursuant to contracts, if any, for the services of chaplains.</p><p>G. Nothing in this section shall be construed as barring or prohibiting a faith-based organization from any opportunity to make a bid or proposal or contract on the grounds that the faith-based organization has exercised the right, as expressed in 42 U.S.C. (§ 2000 e-1 et seq.), to employ persons of a particular religion.</p><p>H. If an individual, who applies for or receives goods, services, or disbursements provided pursuant to a contract between a public body and a faith-based organization, objects to the religious character of the faith-based organization from which the individual receives or would receive the goods, services, or disbursements, the public body shall offer the individual, within a reasonable period of time after the date of his objection, access to equivalent goods, services, or disbursements from an alternative provider.</p><p>The public body shall provide to each individual who applies for or receives goods, services, or disbursements provided pursuant to a contract between a public body and a faith-based organization a notice in bold face type that states: "Neither the public body's selection of a charitable or faith-based provider of services nor the expenditure of funds under this contract is an endorsement of the provider's charitable or religious character, practices, or expression. No provider of services may discriminate against you on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or your refusal to actively participate in a religious practice. If you object to a particular provider because of its religious character, you may request assignment to a different provider. If you believe that your rights have been violated, please discuss the complaint with your provider or notify the appropriate person as indicated in this form."</p><p>2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0774'>774</a>, § 11-35.1; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0928'>928</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1137'>1137</a>.</p>

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|ADMINISTRATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT|B|TRANSACTION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS|52|CHILDREN'S SERVICES ACT|||||§ 2.2-5211|State pool of funds for community policy and management teams.|<p>A. There is established a state pool of funds to be allocated to community policy and management teams in accordance with the appropriation act and appropriate state regulations. These funds, as made available by the General Assembly, shall be expended for public or private nonresidential or residential services for troubled youths and families. However, funds for private special education services shall only be expended on private educational programs that are licensed by the Board of Education or an equivalent out-of-state licensing agency. Effective July 1, 2022, funds for private special education services shall only be expended on private educational programs that the Office of Children's Services certifies as having reported their tuition rates on a standard reporting template developed by the Office. The Office of Children's Services shall consult with private special education services providers in developing the standard reporting template for tuition rates.</p><p>The purposes of this system of funding are to:</p><p>1. Place authority for making program and funding decisions at the community level;</p><p>2. Consolidate categorical agency funding and institute community responsibility for the provision of services;</p><p>3. Provide greater flexibility in the use of funds to purchase services based on the strengths and needs of children, youths, and families; and</p><p>4. Reduce disparity in accessing services and to reduce inadvertent fiscal incentives for serving children and youth according to differing required local match rates for funding streams.</p><p>B. The state pool shall consist of funds that serve the target populations identified in subdivisions 1 through 6 in the purchase of residential and nonresidential services for children and youth. References to funding sources and current placement authority for the targeted populations of children and youth are for the purpose of accounting for the funds in the pool. It is not intended that children and youth be categorized by individual funding streams in order to access services. The target population shall be the following:</p><p>1. Children and youth placed for purposes of special education in approved private school educational programs, previously funded by the Department of Education through private tuition assistance;</p><p>2. Children and youth with disabilities placed by local social services agencies or the Department of Juvenile Justice in private residential facilities or across jurisdictional lines in private, special education day schools, if the individualized education program indicates such school is the appropriate placement while living in foster homes or child-caring facilities, previously funded by the Department of Education through the Interagency Assistance Fund for Noneducational Placements of Handicapped Children;</p><p>3. Children and youth for whom foster care services, as defined by § <a href='/vacode/63.2-905/'>63.2-905</a>, are being provided;</p><p>4. Children and youth placed by a juvenile and domestic relations district court, in accordance with the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/16.1-286/'>16.1-286</a>, in a private or locally operated public facility or nonresidential program, or in a community or facility-based treatment program in accordance with the provisions of subsections B or C of § <a href='/vacode/16.1-284.1/'>16.1-284.1</a>;</p><p>5. Children and youth committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice and placed by it in a private home or in a public or private facility in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/66-14/'>66-14</a>; and</p><p>6. Children and youth previously placed pursuant to subdivision 1 in approved private school educational programs for at least six months who will receive transitional services in a public school setting. State pool funds shall be allocated for no longer than 12 months for transitional services. Local agencies may contract with a private school education program provider to provide transition services in the public school.</p><p>C. The General Assembly and the governing body of each county and city shall annually appropriate such sums of money as shall be sufficient to (i) provide special education services and foster care services for children and youth identified in subdivisions B 1, 2, 3, and 6 and (ii) meet relevant federal mandates for the provision of these services. The community policy and management team shall anticipate to the best of its ability the number of children and youth for whom such services will be required and reserve funds from its state pool allocation to meet these needs. Nothing in this section prohibits local governments from requiring parental or legal financial contributions, where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law or regulation, utilizing a standard sliding fee scale based upon ability to pay, as provided in the appropriation act.</p><p>D. When a community services board established pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/37.2-501/'>37.2-501</a>, local school division, local social service agency, court service unit, or the Department of Juvenile Justice has referred a child and family to a family assessment and planning team and that team has recommended the proper level of treatment and services needed by that child and family and has determined the child's eligibility for funding for services through the state pool of funds, then the community services board, the local school division, local social services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice has met its fiscal responsibility for that child for the services funded through the pool. However, the community services board, the local school division, local social services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice shall continue to be responsible for providing services identified in individual family service plans that are within the agency's scope of responsibility and that are funded separately from the state pool.</p><p>Further, in any instance that an individual 18 through 21 years of age, inclusive, who is eligible for funding from the state pool and is properly defined as a school-aged child with disabilities pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/22.1-213/'>22.1-213</a> is placed by a local social services agency that has custody across jurisdictional lines in a group home in the Commonwealth and the individual's individualized education program (IEP), as prepared by the placing jurisdiction, indicates that a private day school placement is the appropriate educational program for such individual, the financial and legal responsibility for the individual's special education services and IEP shall remain, in compliance with the provisions of federal law, Article 2 (§ <a href='/vacode/22.1-213/'>22.1-213</a>) of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1, and Board of Education regulations, the responsibility of the placing jurisdiction until the individual reaches the age of 21, inclusive, or is no longer eligible for special education services. The financial and legal responsibility for such special education services shall remain with the placing jurisdiction, unless the placing jurisdiction has transitioned all appropriate services with the individual.</p><p>E. In any matter properly before a court for which state pool funds are to be accessed, the court shall, prior to final disposition, and pursuant to §§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-5209/'>2.2-5209</a> and <a href='/vacode/2.2-5212/'>2.2-5212</a>, refer the matter to the community policy and management team for assessment by a local family assessment and planning team authorized by policies of the community policy and management team for assessment to determine the recommended level of treatment and services needed by the child and family. The family assessment and planning team making the assessment shall make a report of the case or forward a copy of the individual family services plan to the court within 30 days of the court's written referral to the community policy and management team. The court shall consider the recommendations of the family assessment and planning team and the community policy and management team. If, prior to a final disposition by the court, the court is requested to consider a level of service not identified or recommended in the report submitted by the family assessment and planning team, the court shall request the community policy and management team to submit a second report characterizing comparable levels of service to the requested level of service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the court may make any disposition as is authorized or required by law. Services ordered pursuant to a disposition rendered by the court pursuant to this section shall qualify for funding as appropriated under this section.</p><p>F. As used in this section, "transitional services" includes services delivered in a public school setting directly to students with significant disabilities or intensive support needs to facilitate their transition back to public school after having been served in a private special education day school or residential facility for at least six months. "Transitional services" includes one-on-one aides, speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral health services, counseling, applied behavior analysis, specially designed instruction delivered directly to the student, or other services needed to facilitate such transition that are delivered directly to the student in their public school over the 12-month period as identified in the child's individualized education program.</p><p>1992, cc. 837, 880, § 2.1-757; 1993, c. 567; 1994, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0854'>854</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0865'>865</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0534'>534</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0669'>669</a>; 2000, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0914'>914</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2004, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0286'>286</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0631'>631</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0304'>304</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0005'>5</a>; 2021, Sp.

Policy and Purpose. </p><p>The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from the acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.</p><p>Article II. The Board. </p><p>A. There is created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Southern States Energy Board" (hereinafter called the Board). The Board shall be composed of three members from each party state, one of whom shall be appointed or designated in each state to represent the Governor, the State Senate and the State House of Representatives, respectively. Each member shall be designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law. Any member of the Board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon (either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provisions therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.</p><p>B. Each party state shall be entitled to one vote on the Board, to be determined by majority vote of each member or member's representative from the party state present and voting on any question. No action of the Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all party states are represented and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the Board are cast in favor thereof.</p><p>C. The Board shall have a seal.</p><p>D. The Board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The Board shall appoint an Executive Director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as Secretary, and who, together with the Treasurer, shall be bonded in such amounts as the Board may require.</p><p>E. The Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.</p><p>F. The Board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the Board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the Board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.</p><p>G. The Board may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.</p><p>H.

The Board shall publish its bylaws, rules and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof, and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.</p><p>K. The Board annually shall make to the governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the Board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the Board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of said state. The Board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</p><p>Article III. Finances. </p><p>A. The Board shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p><p>B. Each of the Board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. One-half of the total amount of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned among the party states in equal shares; one quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on the last decennial federal census; and one quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the latest computations published by the federal census-taking agency. Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the Board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the Board.</p><p>C. The Board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II (h) of this compact, provided that the Board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the Board makes use of funds available to it under Article II H, the Board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet the same.</p><p>D. The Board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Board shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Board shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Board.</p><p>E. The accounts of the Board shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection.</p><p>Article IV.

Recommend such changes in, or amendments or additions to the laws, codes, rules, regulations, administrative procedures and practices or ordinances of the party states in any of the fields of its interest and competence as in its judgment may be appropriate. Any such recommendation shall be made through the appropriate state agency with due consideration of the desirability of uniformity but shall also give appropriate weight to any special circumstance which may justify variations to meet local conditions.</p><p>I. Prepare, publish and distribute, (with or without charge) such reports, bulletins, newsletters or other material as it deems appropriate.</p><p>J. Cooperate with the United States Department of Energy or any agency successor thereto, any other officer or agency of the United States, and any other governmental unit or agency or officer thereof, and with any private persons or agencies in any of the fields of its interests.</p><p>K.

Supplementary Agreements. </p><p>A. To the extent that the Board has not undertaken any activity or project which would be within its power under the provisions of Article V of this compact, any two or more of the party states (acting by their duly constituted administrative officials) may enter into supplementary agreements for the undertaking and continuance of such an activity or project. Any such agreement shall specify its purpose or purposes; its duration and the procedure for termination thereof or withdrawal therefrom; the method of financing and allocating the costs of the activity or project; and such other matters as may be necessary or appropriate. No such supplementary agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall become effective prior to its submission to and approval by the Board.

Unless all of the party states participate in a supplementary agreement, any cost or costs thereof shall be borne separately by the states party thereto. However, the Board may administer or otherwise assist in the operation of any supplementary agreement.</p><p>C. No party to a supplementary agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall be relieved thereby of any obligation or duty assumed by said party state under or pursuant to this compact, except that timely and proper performance of such obligation or duty by means of the supplementary agreement may be offered as performance pursuant to the compact.</p><p>Article VII. Other Laws and Relationships. </p><p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:</p><p>A.

2.2|ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT|II|ADMINISTRATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT|C|INTERSTATE COMPACTS AND AGREEMENTS|59|CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES COMPACT|||||§ 2.2-5900|Form of compact.|<p>The General Assembly hereby enacts, and the Commonwealth of Virginia hereby enters into, the Chesapeake Regional Olympic Games Compact with any and all states legally joining therein according to its terms, in the form substantially as follows:</p><p>CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES COMPACT. </p><p>Article I. Purpose and Findings. </p><p>A. The purpose of this compact shall be to create a regional authority to oversee the conduct of the 2012 Olympic Games, coordinated and managed by the local Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG), and to assure that the region's guarantees and commitments accepted in conjunction with hosting the Olympic Games are fulfilled.</p><p>B. The General Assembly finds that:</p><p>1. For some time, the State of Maryland (including the City of Baltimore), the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the nonprofit organization known as the Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition (WBRC 2012), have been actively engaged in national competition to win the U.S. Candidate City designation and, subsequently, the Host City designation and the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games.</p><p>2. Hosting the Olympic Games will provide several major, lasting, and unique benefits for all of the citizens of the Chesapeake region, including:</p><p>a. Direct, positive economic impact on our regional economy;</p><p>b. An opportunity to showcase our region to the world;</p><p>c. A catalyst for regional action; and</p><p>d. A renewed sense of pride along with a tangible legacy (e.g. new and improved venues and enhanced transportation infrastructure).</p><p>3. Independent economic studies show that preparing for and hosting the Olympic Games will have a positive economic impact on the region, including:</p><p>a. Direct and indirect spending in excess of $5,000,000,000;</p><p>b. The creation of approximately 70,000 jobs;</p><p>c. Increased tax revenues resulting from Olympic-related economic activity in excess of $130,000,000, without raising or creating any new taxes; and</p><p>d. A lasting improvement in the region's competitive position within the travel/tourism industry, as well as the region's ability to attract new businesses.</p><p>4. The citizens of the region have responded positively to WBRC 2012's efforts and solidly embraced the cause to host the Olympic Games, expressed in part by the endorsement of scores of local business, civic, governmental, academic, and amateur sports organizations, and by survey results that show (i) eighty-two percent of the region's residents support the effort to bring the 2012 Olympic Games to this area and (ii) eighty-six percent of area residents believe that the Olympic Games will bring substantial economic benefits to our region.</p><p>5. Through the submission of the region's official bid proposal to the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on December 15, 2000, WBRC 2012 reached a milestone in the process of capturing the Olympic Games by providing a 631-page logistical, operational, and financial blueprint for hosting the 2012 Games.</p><p>6. The bid proposal highlights the great venues and vistas found in our region and is developed around key principles, including (i) building less, not more and (ii) utilizing mass transit, and (iii) protecting the environment.</p><p>7. In addition to the region's bid proposal, the USOC and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) require certain government guarantees and commitments in conjunction with hosting the 2012 Olympic Games, should our region win the U.S. Candidate City designation.</p><p>8. Our unique regional approach to winning the right to host the Olympic Games creates the added complication of determining which entities will provide the necessary guarantees.</p><p>9. It is incumbent upon WBRC 2012 and government leaders to move forward together now to craft the solution that best "lives regionalism" and maximizes the region's chances of winning the 2012 Olympic Games, and reaping the many benefits that come with this honor.</p><p>10. Given that all four jurisdictions, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Baltimore, will host a significant number of events and reap substantial benefits, the most effective solution for all four jurisdictions is to enter into a single agreement that gives the USOC (and subsequently the IOC) a single focal point and a united front that reflects the regional nature of our bid.</p><p>Article II. Definitions. </p><p>As used in this compact:</p><p>"Bid Proposal" means the bid formally submitted by WBRC 2012 to the USOC on December 15, 2000.</p><p>"Host City" means the entity that has been selected by the International Olympic Committee to host the 2012 Olympic Games.</p><p>"International Olympic Committee" and "IOC" means the International Olympic Committee, a body corporate under international law created by the Congress of Paris of 23 June, 1894, and having perpetual succession.</p><p>"Olympic Games" means any Olympic Games sponsored and governed by the International Olympic Committee and any other educational, cultural, athletic, or sporting events related or preliminary thereto.</p><p>"Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games," and "OCOG" means the Committee formed by WBRC 2012 to organize and conduct the Olympic Games, if WBRC 2012 is selected by the IOC as the host city in 2005.</p><p>"Signatories" means the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the City of Baltimore.</p><p>"U.S. Candidate City" means the entity that has received the United States Olympic Committee's endorsement to submit to the IOC the sole bid from the United States for the hosting of the 2012 Olympic Games.</p><p>"United States Olympic Committee" and "USOC" means the United States Olympic Committee, incorporated by Act of Congress on September 21, 1950, and having perpetual succession.</p><p>"WBRC 2012" means Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition, a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland, and its successors.</p><p>Article III. Creation of Regional Authority. </p><p>A. The Signatories hereby provide the mechanism for the creation and termination of the "Chesapeake Regional Olympic Games Authority," hereinafter "Regional Authority," which shall be an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the City of Baltimore, and shall have the powers and duties set forth herein, and those additional powers and duties conferred upon it by subsequent actions of the signatories.</p><p>B. The Regional Authority shall come into existence by the force of this compact when and if, and only if, the IOC awards the 2012 Olympic Games in year 2005 to WBRC 2012, as the U.S. Candidate City and the official representative of the Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Baltimore region.</p><p>C. The Regional Authority shall, if ever brought into existence, cease to exist by the force of this Compact on January 1, 2014, unless extended by substantially similar future legislation passed by each of the Signatories.</p><p>D.
