Neither the Governor nor the members of the board nor any person executing bonds pursuant to this chapter are liable personally on the bonds or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of such bonds.</p><p>F. Any institution may purchase with funds available for such purchase any bond that it has issued at a price not more than the sum of the principal amount and accrued interest. All bonds so purchased shall be cancelled unless purchased as an endowment fund investment. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply to the redemption of bonds.</p><p>G. In any case in which an institution obtains a loan from the United States or any federal agency to erect any project that requires the establishment of a debt service reserve, the institution, with the consent of the Governor, may deposit securities in a separate collateral account in an amount equal to the required debt service reserve and pledge such securities to meet the debt service requirements if the revenues derived from any source set forth in subdivision C 1 a, b, c, or d and pledged for the payment of such loan become insufficient for such purpose. The face value of United States government securities and the market value of all other securities is the value of any securities so deposited. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit repayment of any portion of such loan from income derived from the securities so deposited. No securities shall be deposited in any such collateral account unless such securities are purchased with funds whose use is in no way limited or restricted or are donated to such institution for the purpose of establishing such debt service reserve.</p><p>1933, p. 85, § 23-19; 1936-7, p. 28; 1946, p. 184; 1950, p. 366; 1954, c. 397; 1958, cc. 17, 486; 1959, Ex.
