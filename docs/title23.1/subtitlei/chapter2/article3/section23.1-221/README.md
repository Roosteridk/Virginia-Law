Fails or refuses to furnish the Council with any requested information or records required by this article or the Council's regulations.</p><p>B. The Council may refuse to grant an approval or may place conditions on an approval for a request to use a name that incorporates terms deemed by the Council to be misleading to consumers, students, or the general public regarding the postsecondary school's affiliation or association with any public institution of higher education but shall not add conditions to, revoke, or suspend a prior approval of a name. The Council shall, by regulation, designate the terms deemed to be misleading, which shall include "public university," "public college," and "community college."</p><p>C. The Council shall notify a postsecondary school by certified mail, return receipt requested, of its intention to deny an application, suspend or revoke a prior approval or certification, or add conditions to an approval or certification and state in writing the reasons for the denial, suspension, revocation, or conditions. The postsecondary school may, within 10 days of receipt of the certified mail notice, submit a written request for a proceeding before the Council pursuant to Article 3 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4018/'>2.2-4018</a> et seq.) of Chapter 40 of Title 2.2.</p><p>D.

The Council shall make a final administrative decision on such appeal in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/'>2.2-4000</a> et seq.).</p><p>F.
