# ยง 23.1-2907.1 Policy for award of academic credit for apprenticeship credentials.

<p>The State Board shall require each comprehensive community college to develop policies and procedures for the award of academic credit to any student enrolled in a comprehensive community college who has successfully completed a state-approved registered apprenticeship credential in a field that is aligned with a credit-bearing program of study at the comprehensive community college in which the student is enrolled. Such policies shall ensure that academic credit is awarded only to students who have achieved the same outcomes and with the same academic rigor as in the equivalent courses offered by the institution.</p><p>2017, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0021'>21</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0130'>130</a>.</p>
