# § 15.2-717 Time in which to contest real property assessments.

<p>Any person aggrieved by an assessment of real estate made by the department of real estate assessments may apply for relief to the circuit court of the county within one year from December 31 of the year in which such assessment is made for assessments made prior to January 1, 2005; within two years from December 31 of the year in which such assessment is made for assessments made on and after January 1, 2005, but prior to January 1, 2007; and within the time frame as provided by general law pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3984/'>58.1-3984</a> for assessments made on and after January 1, 2007. No person may make such application for a year other than the current year unless such person has provided to the assessor, commissioner of the revenue, or the governing body, written notice of disagreement with the assessment, during the applicable tax year. The application shall be before the court when it is filed in the clerk's office. In such proceeding the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to show that the property in question is valued at more than its fair market value or that the assessment is not uniform in its application, or that the assessment is otherwise invalid or illegal, but it shall not be necessary for the taxpayer to show that intentional, systematic and willful discrimination has taken place. The proceedings shall be conducted as an action at law before the court, sitting without a jury, and the court shall act with the authority granted by §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3987/'>58.1-3987</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3988/'>58.1-3988</a>.</p><p>1991, c. 143, § 15.1-686.01; 1997, c. 587; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1036'>1036</a>.</p>
