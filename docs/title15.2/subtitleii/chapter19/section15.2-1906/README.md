# § 15.2-1906 Condemnation of existing water or sewage disposal systems.

<p>Condemnation of existing water or sewage disposal systems shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 19.1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1908/'>15.2-1908</a> et seq.) of this title so far as applicable. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-102/'>25.1-102</a> shall not apply in the case of condemnation of an existing water or sewage disposal system in its entirety. The circuit court for the city or county wherein the property proposed to be condemned, or any part thereof, is located, shall have jurisdiction of the condemnation proceedings. It shall not be necessary to file with the petition for the condemnation of an existing water or sewage system, in its entirety, a minute inventory and description of the property sought to be condemned, provided the property is described therein generally and with reasonable particularity and in such manner as to disclose the intention of the petitioner that such existing water or sewage system be condemned in its entirety. The court having jurisdiction of the condemnation proceedings shall, as the occasion arises and prior to the filing of the report of the commissioners appointed to determine a just compensation for the property sought to be condemned in its entirety, take such steps as may be necessary and proper to cause to be included in an inventory of the property sought to be condemned full descriptions of any and all such property whenever the exigencies of the case or the ends of justice will be promoted thereby. Such inventory shall be made a part of the record in the proceedings and referred to the commissioners.</p><p>Code 1950, § 15-754; 1962, c. 623, § 15.1-340; 1997, c. 587; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0940'>940</a>.</p>
