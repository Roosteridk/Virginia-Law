<p>The governing body of any locality may from time to time require of any board, commission or authority, hereinafter referred to as recipient agency, to which it has power to appropriate public funds and has appropriated such funds in the past or has received a request for appropriations, such information books and records of the recipient agency as the governing body deems necessary in order that it may be assured that an appropriation or proposed appropriation will not result in the dissipation of public funds and in order that it may determine the use of past and the proposed use of future appropriations, the method of management, control and organization of the recipient agency and its present and proposed programs. If the governing body determines that a particular administrative function or activity of the recipient organization duplicates the services provided by the governing body and that public funds may be conserved by combining, consolidating or coordinating the activities of the recipient agency with those of the locality, it may, in lieu of an appropriation of funds for that function or activity, provide the recipient agency with the necessary goods and services. The governing body may assign officers and employees to coordinate the functions and activities of the governing body and those of the various recipient agencies.</p><p>1968, c. 554, ยง 15.1-20.2; 1997, c. 587.</p>
