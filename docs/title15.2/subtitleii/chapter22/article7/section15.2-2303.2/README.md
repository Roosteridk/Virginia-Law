<p>A. The governing body of any locality accepting cash payments voluntarily proffered on or after July 1, 2005, pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/'>15.2-2298</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303.1/'>15.2-2303.1</a> shall, within 12 years of receiving full payment of all cash proffered pursuant to an approved rezoning application, begin, or cause to begin (i) construction, (ii) site work, (iii) engineering, (iv) right-of-way acquisition, (v) surveying, or (vi) utility relocation on the improvements for which the cash payments were proffered. A locality that does not comply with the above requirement, or does not begin alternative improvements as provided for in subsection C, shall forward the amount of the proffered cash payments to the Commonwealth Transportation Board no later than December 31 following the fiscal year in which such forfeiture occurred for direct allocation to the secondary system construction program or the urban system construction program for the locality in which the proffered cash payments were collected. The funds to which any locality may be entitled under the provisions of Title 33.2 for construction, improvement, or maintenance of primary, secondary, or urban roads shall not be diminished by reason of any funds remitted pursuant to this subsection by such locality, regardless of whether such contributions are matched by state or federal funds.</p><p>B. The governing body of any locality eligible to accept any proffered cash payments pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/'>15.2-2298</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303.1/'>15.2-2303.1</a> shall, for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year 2007, (i) include in its capital improvement program created pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2239/'>15.2-2239</a>, or as an appendix thereto, the amount of all proffered cash payments received during the most recent fiscal year for which a report has been filed pursuant to subsection E, and (ii) include in its annual capital budget the amount of proffered cash payments projected to be used for expenditures or appropriated for capital improvements in the ensuing year.</p><p>C. Regardless of the date of rezoning approval, unless prohibited by the proffer agreement accepted by the governing body of a locality pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/'>15.2-2298</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303.1/'>15.2-2303.1</a>, a locality may utilize any cash payments proffered for any road improvement or any transportation improvement that is incorporated into the capital improvements program as its matching contribution under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-357/'>33.2-357</a>. For purposes of this section, "road improvement" includes construction of new roads or improvement or expansion of existing roads as required by applicable construction standards of the Virginia Department of Transportation to meet increased demand attributable to new development. For purposes of this section, "transportation improvement" means any real or personal property acquired, constructed, improved, or used for constructing, improving, or operating any (i) public mass transit system or (ii) highway, or portion or interchange thereof, including parking facilities located within a district created pursuant to this title. Such improvements shall include, without limitation, public mass transit systems, public highways, and all buildings, structures, approaches, and facilities thereof and appurtenances thereto, rights-of-way, bridges, tunnels, stations, terminals, and all related equipment and fixtures.</p><p>Regardless of the date of rezoning approval, unless prohibited by the proffer agreement accepted by the governing body of a locality pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/'>15.2-2298</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303.1/'>15.2-2303.1</a>, a locality may utilize any cash payments proffered for capital improvements for alternative improvements of the same category within the locality in the vicinity of the improvements for which the cash payments were originally made. Prior to utilization of such cash payments for the alternative improvements, the governing body of the locality shall give at least 30 days' written notice of the proposed alternative improvements to the entity who paid such cash payment mailed to the last known address of such entity, or if proffer payment records no longer exist, then to the original zoning applicant, and conduct a public hearing on such proposal advertised as provided in subsection F of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1427/'>15.2-1427</a>. The governing body of the locality prior to the use of such cash payments for alternative improvements shall, following such public hearing, find: (a) the improvements for which the cash payments were proffered cannot occur in a timely manner or the functional purpose for which the cash payment was made no longer exists; (b) the alternative improvements are within the vicinity of the proposed improvements for which the cash payments were proffered; and (c) the alternative improvements are in the public interest. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Virginia Public Procurement Act, the governing body may negotiate and award a contract without competition to an entity that is constructing road improvements pursuant to a proffered zoning condition or special exception condition in order to expand the scope of the road improvements by utilizing cash proffers of others or other available locally generated funds. The local governing body shall adopt a resolution stating the basis for awarding the construction contract to extend the scope of the road improvements. All road improvements to be included in the state primary or secondary system of highways must conform to the adopted standards of the Virginia Department of Transportation.</p><p>D. Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other provision of law, general or special, no cash payment proffered pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/'>15.2-2298</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303.1/'>15.2-2303.1</a> shall be used for any capital improvement to an existing facility, such as a renovation or technology upgrade, that does not expand the capacity of such facility or for any operating expense of any existing facility such as ordinary maintenance or repair.</p><p>E.
