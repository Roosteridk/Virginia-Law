# § 15.2-2298 Same; additional conditions as a part of rezoning or zoning map amendment in certain high-growth localities.

<p>A. Except for those localities to which § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a> is applicable, this section shall apply to (i) any locality which has had population growth of 5% or more from the next-to-latest to latest decennial census year, based on population reported by the United States Bureau of the Census; (ii) any city adjoining such city or county; (iii) any towns located within such county; and (iv) any county contiguous with at least three such counties, and any town located in that county. However, any such locality may by ordinance choose to utilize the conditional zoning authority granted under § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2303/'>15.2-2303</a> rather than this section.</p><p>In any such locality, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2297/'>15.2-2297</a>, a zoning ordinance may include and provide for the voluntary proffering in writing, by the owner, of reasonable conditions, prior to a public hearing before the governing body, in addition to the regulations provided for the zoning district or zone by the ordinance, as a part of a rezoning or amendment to a zoning map, provided that (i) the rezoning itself gives rise to the need for the conditions; (ii) the conditions have a reasonable relation to the rezoning; and (iii) all conditions are in conformity with the comprehensive plan as defined in § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2223/'>15.2-2223</a>.</p><p>Reasonable conditions may include the payment of cash for any off-site road improvement or any off-site transportation improvement that is adopted as an amendment to the required comprehensive plan and incorporated into the capital improvements program, provided that nothing herein shall prevent a locality from accepting proffered conditions which are not normally included in a capital improvement program. For purposes of this section, "road improvement" includes construction of new roads or improvement or expansion of existing roads as required by applicable construction standards of the Virginia Department of Transportation to meet increased demand attributable to new development. For purposes of this section, "transportation improvement" means any real or personal property acquired, constructed, improved, or used for constructing, improving, or operating any (i) public mass transit system or (ii) highway, or portion or interchange thereof, including parking facilities located within a district created pursuant to this title. Such improvements shall include, without limitation, public mass transit systems, public highways, and all buildings, structures, approaches, and facilities thereof and appurtenances thereto, rights-of-way, bridges, tunnels, stations, terminals, and all related equipment and fixtures.</p><p>Reasonable conditions shall not include, however, conditions that impose upon the applicant the requirement to create a property owners' association under the Property Owners' Association Act (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-1800/'>55.1-1800</a> et seq.) which includes an express further condition that members of a property association pay an assessment for the maintenance of public facilities owned in fee by a public entity, including open space, parks, schools, fire departments, and other public facilities not otherwise provided for in § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2241/'>15.2-2241</a>; however, such facilities shall not include sidewalks, special street signs or markers, or special street lighting in public rights-of-way not maintained by the Department of Transportation. The governing body may also accept amended proffers once the public hearing has begun if the amended proffers do not materially affect the overall proposal. Once proffered and accepted as part of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, the conditions shall continue in effect until a subsequent amendment changes the zoning on the property covered by the conditions; however, the conditions shall continue if the subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or substantially revised zoning ordinance.</p><p>No proffer shall be accepted by a locality unless it has adopted a capital improvement program pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2239/'>15.2-2239</a> or local charter. In the event proffered conditions include the dedication of real property or payment of cash, the property shall not transfer and the payment of cash shall not be made until the facilities for which the property is dedicated or cash is tendered are included in the capital improvement program, provided that nothing herein shall prevent a locality from accepting proffered conditions which are not normally included in a capital improvement program. If proffered conditions include the dedication of real property or the payment of cash, the proffered conditions shall provide for the disposition of the property or cash payment in the event the property or cash payment is not used for the purpose for which proffered.</p><p>B. In the event proffered conditions include a requirement for the dedication of real property of substantial value, or substantial cash payments for or construction of substantial public improvements, the need for which is not generated solely by the rezoning itself, then no amendment to the zoning map for the property subject to such conditions, nor the conditions themselves, nor any amendments to the text of the zoning ordinance with respect to the zoning district applicable thereto initiated by the governing body, which eliminate, or materially restrict, reduce, or modify the uses, the floor area ratio, or the density of use permitted in the zoning district applicable to the property, shall be effective with respect to the property unless there has been mistake, fraud, or a change in circumstances substantially affecting the public health, safety, or welfare.</p><p>C. Any landowner who has prior to July 1, 1990, proffered the dedication of real property of substantial value, or substantial cash payments for or construction of substantial public improvements, the need for which is not generated solely by the rezoning itself, but who has not substantially implemented such proffers prior to July 1, 1990, shall advise the local governing body by certified mail prior to July 1, 1991, that he intends to proceed with the implementation of such proffers. The notice shall identify the property to be developed, the zoning district, and the proffers applicable thereto. Thereafter, any landowner giving such notice shall have until July 1, 1995, substantially to implement the proffers, or such later time as the governing body may allow. Thereafter, the landowner in good faith shall diligently pursue the completion of the development of the property. Any landowner who complies with the requirements of this subsection shall be entitled to the protection against action initiated by the governing body affecting use, floor area ratio, and density set out in subsection B above, unless there has been mistake, fraud, or a change in circumstances substantially affecting the public health, safety, or welfare, but any landowner failing to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall acquire no rights pursuant to this section.</p><p>D. The provisions of subsections B and C of this section shall be effective prospectively only, and not retroactively, and shall not apply to any zoning ordinance text amendments which may have been enacted prior to March 10, 1990. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect any litigation pending prior to July 1, 1990, or any such litigation nonsuited and thereafter refiled.</p><p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect or impair the authority of a governing body to:</p><p>1. Accept proffered conditions which include provisions for timing or phasing of dedications, payments, or improvements; or</p><p>2. Accept or impose valid conditions pursuant to subdivision A 3 of § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2286/'>15.2-2286</a> or other provision of law.</p><p>1989, c. 697, § 15.1-492.2:1; 1990, c. 868; 1991, c. 233; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0587'>587</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0703'>703</a>; 2006, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0450'>450</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0882'>882</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0324'>324</a>.</p>
