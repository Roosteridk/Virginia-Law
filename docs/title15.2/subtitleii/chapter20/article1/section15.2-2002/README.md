# ยง 15.2-2002 Acquisitions in connection with public right-of-way changes.

<p>Every locality proposing to open or widen any public right-of-way by taking a part of any lot or other subdivision of property in such manner that the remnant thereof would, in the opinion of the governing body, be so small or of such shape as to be unsuited for the erection of appropriate buildings thereon may acquire, as permitted by ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1800/'>15.2-1800</a>, the whole of the lot or other subdivision of property. Any such acquisition is declared to be for a public use, as the term public uses is used in Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia. The locality may subsequently replat and dispose of the remnant of such property not used for right-of-way purposes in whole or in part, limiting the uses thereof as it may see fit. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any locality any power to condemn the property of any railroad company or public service corporation which it does not otherwise possess under existing law.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 15-771; 1962, c. 623, ยง 15.1-372; 1971, Ex.
