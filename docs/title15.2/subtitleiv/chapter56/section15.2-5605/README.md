To enter into contracts agreeing to carry out any of the provisions set forth in subdivisions 1 or 2, providing for the operation and maintenance of all or any part of a project or otherwise facilitating the construction, development, operation or financing of all or any part of a project; and</p><p>4. To enter into leases with the authority pursuant to which a project or any part thereof is leased to the locality. The lease may be for a term ending not later than the end of the then current fiscal year of the locality and renewable for additional terms of one fiscal year each or as may be agreed upon by the parties provided that the total of the original term and any renewals shall in no event exceed fifty years. Each renewal shall be at the option of such locality and the lease may provide that it is renewed for an additional term if the locality fails to cancel the lease in writing on or prior to sixty days before the end of the then current term. Rentals under such lease may be computed at fixed amounts or by a formula based on any factors provided therein and the rentals payable may include provision for all or any part of or a share of the amounts necessary (i) to pay or provide for the expenses of operation and maintenance of a project, (ii) to provide for the payment of principal and interest on any bonds of the authority, and (iii) to maintain such reserves or sinking funds as may be required by the terms of any contract of the authority or as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the authority. Such payments shall be payable only from revenues of the locality available during the fiscal year during which the lease is in effect. Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-5606/'>15.2-5606</a> or any other provision hereof the authority or the locality leasing the project may contract with a person as sublessee or operator of the project at a compensation to be agreed upon by the parties.</p><p>Code 1950, § 15-714.18; 1962, c. 393, § 6, § 15.1-1276; 1973, c. 238; 1975, c. 109; 1997, c. 587.</p>
