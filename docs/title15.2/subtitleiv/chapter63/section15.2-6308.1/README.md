<p>If an authority desires to undertake a project or other activity as provided in this chapter, and the property involved in such undertaking is subject to a reversionary interest in favor of the Commonwealth, such undertaking shall require the prior approval of the Governor but shall not require the approval of any other agency or political subdivision of the Commonwealth. Once the Governor grants such approval, the Commonwealth's reversionary interest in such property shall be subordinate to any lease, mortgage, or other transaction entered into by such authority with regard to such property.</p><p>2005, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0869'>869</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0887'>887</a>.</p>
