The Department of Human Resource Management shall administer this section. The plan chosen shall provide means whereby coverage for the families or dependents of state employees may be purchased. Except for part-time employees, the Commonwealth may pay all or a portion of the cost thereof, and for such portion as the Commonwealth does not pay, the employee, including a part-time employee, may purchase the coverage by paying the additional cost over the cost of coverage for an employee.</p><p>Such contribution shall be financed through appropriations provided by law.</p><p>B. The plan shall:</p><p>1. Include coverage for low-dose screening mammograms for determining the presence of occult breast cancer.

Such notification may include a description of the health care services rendered at the time of the visit.</p><p>14.
