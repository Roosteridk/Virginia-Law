If health coverage offered to state employees under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/'>2.2-2818</a> offers coverage in the same manner and to the same extent as the coverage required by an insurance mandate imposed under Title 38.2 or coverage that is greater than an insurance mandate imposed under Title 38.2, the coverage offered to state employees under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/'>2.2-2818</a> shall be considered in compliance with the insurance mandate.</p><p>2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0247'>247</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0317'>317</a>; 2017, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0716'>716</a>.</p>
