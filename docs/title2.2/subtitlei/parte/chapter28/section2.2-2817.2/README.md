<p>The University of Virginia Medical Center, hereafter referred to as the Medical Center, may purchase basic group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance policies covering in whole or in part any of its employees. In addition, the Medical Center may establish, administer and make available to employees a program of optional insurance, including life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance. Employees of the Medical Center covered under the aforesaid basic insurance policies purchased by the Medical Center shall not be covered by the insurance program established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-501/'>51.1-501</a> or be considered "eligible employees" under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1100/'>51.1-1100</a>, unless the University of Virginia Board of Visitors, or a duly authorized agent or representative of the Board, purchases such insurance policies from the Virginia Retirement System. Nor shall they be required to present at their own expense evidence of insurability satisfactory to an insurance company upon changing from one form of coverage to another form of coverage provided pursuant to this section. Chapter 5 of Title 51.1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-500/'>51.1-500</a> et seq.) shall not apply to any insurance coverage offered by the Medical Center except that the provisions of §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/'>51.1-510</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-511/'>51.1-511</a> shall apply to such insurance coverage; provided that any administrative or ministerial functions performed by or on behalf of the Board of the Virginia Retirement System under §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/'>51.1-510</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-511/'>51.1-511</a> shall be performed by the Medical Center.</p><p>Notwithstanding the definition of "state employee" contained in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.3/'>51.1-124.3</a>, all employees of the Medical Center may be enrolled in a health care plan other than that provided for in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/'>2.2-2818</a> at the election of the Medical Center and subject to the review and approval of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia; however, any Medical Center employee who was first employed by the Medical Center prior to July 1, 1996, and who had not been classified as a health care provider under the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-502.1/'>51.1-502.1</a> prior to July 1, 1996, shall be provided the option of enrolling in a health care plan elected by the Medical Center or enrolling in the health care plan established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/'>2.2-2818</a> until such time as the University of Virginia Board of Visitors may determine that it is not in the best interest of the University to continue to provide that option to any employees of the Medical Center. If the Board of Visitors determines that such health plan option will not continue to be provided, any Medical Center employees who must reenroll in a different health plan shall be allowed to do so with a waiver of preexisting medical conditions for the employees and, if applicable, their spouses and dependents.</p><p>Subject to such eligibility criteria as it may establish, the Medical Center may make available to any of its employees the insurance programs established pursuant to this section, including health plan coverage, notwithstanding the fact that such employees may not be eligible for participation in any retirement plan established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126.3/'>51.1-126.3</a> or the retirement system established pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/'>51.1-124.1</a> et seq.) of this title.</p><p>The eligibility of any employee of the Medical Center for participation in any insurance program established pursuant to this section shall not of itself render such employees eligible for participation in the Virginia Retirement System or any optional retirement program.</p><p>2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0694'>694</a>, § 2.1-20.1:9.1.</p>
