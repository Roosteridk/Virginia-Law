In this event, the full text of the regulation shall be available for public inspection at the office of the Registrar and the promulgating agency.</p><p>If a proposed regulation is adopted as published or, in the sole discretion of the Registrar of Regulations, the only changes that have been made are those that can be clearly and concisely explained, the adopted regulation need not be published at length. Instead, the Register shall contain a notation that the proposed regulation has been adopted as published as a proposed regulation without change or stating the changes made. The proposed regulation shall be clearly identified with a citation to the issue and page numbers where published.</p><p>A copy of all reporting forms the promulgating agency anticipates will be incorporated into or be used in administering the regulation shall be published with the proposed and final regulation in the Register.</p><p>B.

Summaries shall be prepared by the promulgating agency and approved by the Registrar prior to their publication in the Register.
