A legislative objection has been filed in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4014/'>2.2-4014</a>, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn by the agency, shall become effective on a date specified by the agency that shall be after the expiration of the applicable twenty-one-day extension period provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4014/'>2.2-4014</a>;</p><p>2.

Whenever the regulatory process has been suspended for any reason, any action by the agency that either amends the regulation or does not amend the regulation but specifies a new effective date shall be considered a readoption of the regulation for the purposes of appeal.
