# § 2.2-3800 Short title; findings; principles of information practice.

<p>A. This chapter may be cited as the "Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act."</p><p>B. The General Assembly finds that:</p><p>1. An individual's privacy is directly affected by the extensive collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information;</p><p>2. The increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the harm that can occur from these practices;</p><p>3. An individual's opportunities to secure employment, insurance, credit, and his right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain of these personal information systems; and</p><p>4. In order to preserve the rights guaranteed a citizen in a free society, legislation is necessary to establish procedures to govern information systems containing records on individuals.</p><p>C. Recordkeeping agencies of the Commonwealth and political subdivisions shall adhere to the following principles of information practice to ensure safeguards for personal privacy:</p><p>1. There shall be no personal information system whose existence is secret.</p><p>2. Information shall not be collected unless the need for it has been clearly established in advance.</p><p>3. Information shall be appropriate and relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected.</p><p>4. Information shall not be obtained by fraudulent or unfair means.</p><p>5. Information shall not be used unless it is accurate and current.</p><p>6. There shall be a prescribed procedure for an individual to learn the purpose for which information has been recorded and particulars about its use and dissemination.</p><p>7. There shall be a clearly prescribed and uncomplicated procedure for an individual to correct, erase or amend inaccurate, obsolete or irrelevant information.</p><p>8. Any agency holding personal information shall assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent its misuse.</p><p>9. There shall be a clearly prescribed procedure to prevent personal information collected for one purpose from being used or disseminated for another purpose unless such use or dissemination is authorized or required by law.</p><p>10. The Commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision thereof shall not collect personal information except as explicitly or implicitly authorized by law.</p><p>1976, c. 597, §§ 2.1-377, 2.1-378; 1987, c. 506; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0791'>791</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0914'>914</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0918'>918</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0927'>927</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0849'>849</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0867'>867</a>; 2018, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0597'>597</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0679'>679</a>.</p>
