In the event that any group home or other residential facility in which CSA children reside has its licensure status lowered to provisional as a result of multiple health and safety or human rights violations, all children placed through CSA in such facility shall be assessed as to whether it is in the best interests of each child placed to be removed from the facility and placed in a fully licensed facility and no additional CSA placements shall be made in the provisionally licensed facility until and unless the violations and deficiencies relating to health and safety or human rights that caused the designation as provisional shall be completely remedied and full licensure status restored.</p><p>2. Prior to the placement of a child across jurisdictional lines, the family assessment and planning teams shall (i) explore all appropriate community services for the child, (ii) document that no appropriate placement is available in the locality, and (iii) report the rationale for the placement decision to the community policy and management team. The community policy and management team shall report annually to the Office of Children's Services on the gaps in the services needed to keep children in the local community and any barriers to the development of those services.</p><p>3. Community policy and management teams, family assessment and planning teams or other local entities responsible for CSA placements shall notify the receiving school division whenever a child is placed across jurisdictional lines and identify any children with disabilities and foster care children to facilitate compliance with expedited enrollment and special education requirements.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0781'>781</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0366'>366</a>.</p>
