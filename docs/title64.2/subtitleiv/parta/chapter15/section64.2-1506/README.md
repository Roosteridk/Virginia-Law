In such case, the fiduciary shall not take a commission as fiduciary to the extent that the fiduciary, or its affiliate or division, receive compensation for services relating to advice or services to such mutual fund, investment trust, or investment company, unless (i) otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the creator of the trust or affected beneficiary or (ii) the fiduciary discloses by statement, prospectus, or otherwise to all current income beneficiaries of an account the rate, formula, or other method by which the compensation received or to be received by the fiduciary or affiliate or division of the fiduciary for such advice and services is determined.
