# § 64.2-1315 Certification and recording of accounts settled in a judicial proceeding.

<p>When the account of any fiduciary is settled in a judicial proceeding, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the circuit court in which the judicial proceeding was held, as soon as may be practicable after entry of a final order, to certify to the clerk of the circuit court in which the fiduciary qualified a copy of the account so far as the account has been confirmed, with a memorandum at the foot of the copy stating the style of the suit and the date of the final order. The account and memorandum so certified shall be recorded by the clerk to whom it is certified in the book in which accounts of fiduciaries are required to be recorded under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1214/'>64.2-1214</a>. If in a proceeding subsequent to the entry of the final order, the account is reformed or altered, a copy of such reformed or altered account shall be certified and recorded, together with a memorandum stating the style of the suit and the date of the order or decree of confirmation, in the same manner as the final order. When the judicial proceeding is conducted in the same court in which the fiduciary qualified, the clerk of such court shall make the memoranda and recordations required by this section, and shall for such purpose use the original papers. For making any copy under this section, the clerk shall be entitled to the fees prescribed in like cases, and for recording such account of the fiduciary he shall be entitled to the fees allowed for recording accounts settled ex parte. The fees for copying and recording shall be paid as the court in which the judicial proceeding was held shall direct.</p><p>Code 1919, § 5411; Code 1950, § 26-21; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0681'>681</a>; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614'>614</a>.</p>
