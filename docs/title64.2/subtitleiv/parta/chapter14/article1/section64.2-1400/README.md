<p>A. Subject to the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1406/'>64.2-1406</a>, the clerk of any circuit court or any duly qualified deputy of such clerk may qualify any trustee named in a will, deed, or other writing, and require and take from them the necessary bonds in the same manner and with like effect as the court.</p><p>B. Pursuant to the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1426/'>64.2-1426</a>, the clerk or deputy may appoint and qualify an individual or a corporation authorized under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-803/'>6.2-803</a> as trustee. Such appointment may be made in the same manner and subject to the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-500/'>64.2-500</a>.</p><p>C. The clerk shall not require security from a trustee if the will, deed, or other writing directs that a trustee shall not give security, unless, based on the application of any interested person or on the clerk's own knowledge, the clerk determines that security ought to be required. This section shall not be construed to require security where security is not required pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1003/'>6.2-1003</a> or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1401/'>64.2-1401</a> or to affect the jurisdiction of the court to qualify trustees and to require security or not, as the court sees fit.</p><p>D. Qualification of a trustee under this section may be ex parte, and no prior notice to the beneficiaries of the qualification shall be required. If less than all the trustees named in the deed, will, or other writing desire to qualify, then the trustee shall only be qualified after reasonable notice is given to any other named trustees.</p><p>E. If less than all the trustees named in the will, deed, or other writing qualify, then the trust powers conferred by the trust instrument shall be exercisable only by the trustees who have qualified under this section or in any other manner permitted by law.</p><p>1964, c. 464, § 26-46.1; 1977, c. 256; 1981, c. 239; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0220'>220</a>; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614'>614</a>.</p>
