The court, in its discretion, may order that a portion of the estate be reserved to pay all or a proportion of a claim of a surety for the decedent or any other contingent claim against the estate, or to pay all or a proportion of any other claim not finally passed upon, provided that creditors of the same class shall be paid in the same proportion.</p><p>B. For any claim allowed subsequent to any dividend where the court ordered that a portion of the estate be reserved to pay such a claim, the court shall order that the claim be paid from the estate in the possession of the personal representative, regardless of the existence of any debt or demand of superior dignity for which no reservation has been ordered. The claim shall be paid in the same proportion as creditors of the same class, provided, however, that whether there be enough reserved to pay the claim pursuant to this subsection shall not affect any dividend already paid.</p><p>C. If there are assets remaining in the possession of the personal representative after claims are paid pursuant to subsections A and B, or if further assets come into the possession of the personal representative, such surplus shall be divided among all the decedent's creditors who have proved debts and demands against the decedent's estate in the order and proportion in which they may be entitled.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 64-164, 64-165, 64-166; 1968, c. 656, §§ 64.1-174, 64.1-175, 64.1-176; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614'>614</a>.</p>
