# § 64.2-1036 Fiduciary duties; general principles.

<p>A. In making an allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall:</p><p>1. Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;</p><p>2. Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more beneficiaries;</p><p>3. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust, even if there is a different provision in this chapter; and</p><p>4. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise.</p><p>B. A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power that produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.</p><p>C. A fiduciary shall:</p><p>1. Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and</p><p>2. Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the disbursement between income and principal.</p><p>D. A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under § <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1038/'>64.2-1038</a>, convert an income trust to a unitrust under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1041/'>64.2-1041</a>, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under subdivision A 2 of § <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1041/'>64.2-1041</a>, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under subdivision A 3 of § <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1041/'>64.2-1041</a> if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power will assist the fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially.</p><p>E. Factors the fiduciary must consider in making the determination under subsection D include:</p><p>1. The terms of the trust;</p><p>2. The nature, distribution standards, and expected duration of the trust;</p><p>3. The effect of the allocation rules, including specific adjustments between income and principal, under Articles 4 (§ <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1048/'>64.2-1048</a> et seq.) through 9 (§ <a href='https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1073/'>64.2-1073</a> et seq.);</p><p>4. The desirability of liquidity and regularity of income;</p><p>5. The desirability of the preservation and appreciation of principal;</p><p>6. The extent to which an asset is used or may be used by a beneficiary;</p><p>7. The increase or decrease in the value of principal assets, reasonably determined by the fiduciary;</p><p>8. Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from accumulating income or invading principal;</p><p>9. The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods;</p><p>10. The effect of current and reasonably expected economic conditions; and</p><p>11. The reasonably expected tax consequences of the exercise of the power.</p><p>2022, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0354'>354</a>.</p>
