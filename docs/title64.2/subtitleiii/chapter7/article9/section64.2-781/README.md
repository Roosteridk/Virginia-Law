A trustee shall not be liable to a beneficiary for the trustee's good faith reliance on a waiver of the rule of subsection A.</p><p>1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0772'>772</a>, ยง 26-45.3; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614'>614</a>.</p>
