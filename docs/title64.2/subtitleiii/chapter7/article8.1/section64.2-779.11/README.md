Alter any condition or restriction related to the charitable interest.</p><p>D. If there are two or more second trusts, the second trusts shall be treated as one trust for purposes of determining whether the exercise of the decanting power diminishes the charitable interest or diminishes the interest of an identified charitable organization for purposes of subsection C.</p><p>E. If a first trust contains a determinable charitable interest, the second trust or trusts that include a charitable interest pursuant to subsection C must be administered under the law of the Commonwealth unless:</p><p>1.
