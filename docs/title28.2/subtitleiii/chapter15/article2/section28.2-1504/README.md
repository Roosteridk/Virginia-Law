# ยง 28.2-1504 Preparation of management plan.

<p>A. The Commission shall prepare and implement a plan for the management of the Commonwealth's ungranted shores of the sea, marsh and meadowlands. The management plan, and any regulations and guidelines promulgated to implement the management plan, shall conserve and protect the shores of the sea, marsh and meadowlands, and the natural values and natural processes associated therewith. To the extent not inconsistent with that goal, the management plan shall also consider the traditional uses of such properties and the promotion of tourism and commerce. Through methods consistent with that goal, the management plan, and any regulations and guidelines promulgated to implement the management plan, shall recognize the use of such properties, where they have been so used in the past, as a commons by the people of the Commonwealth for the purpose of fishing, fowling, hunting, and the taking and catching of oysters and other shellfish. The Commission shall review the management plan every five years.</p><p>B. In developing regulations, guidelines, or management plans under this chapter, the Commission shall consult with the Virginia Coastal Land Management Advisory Council.</p><p>1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0850'>850</a>.</p>
