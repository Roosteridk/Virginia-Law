# § 28.2-1511 Claims to ungranted shores of the sea, marsh and meadowlands proposed for designation in amended or supplemental inventory.

<p>A. The Commission shall not file any amended or supplemental inventory, if such amended or supplemental inventory initially designates a parcel of land as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowland, unless the Commission has approved such amended or supplemental inventory as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1510/'>28.2-1510</a>. The Commission shall give notice of its intention to file such amended or supplemental inventory to any person listed as having an ownership interest in such land in the land records of the circuit court for the county. The notice shall be sent by postpaid mail to the address of the person as shown on the land book. The Commission shall also cause notice of its intent to file an amended or supplemental inventory to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where such land is located.</p><p>B. Any person claiming ownership of an interest in lands described in a notice given pursuant to subsection A may bring an action for declaratory judgment to determine title to the land pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-184/'>8.01-184</a>, to establish the boundaries to land pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-179/'>8.01-179</a>, or an action of ejectment pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-131/'>8.01-131</a>. Any such action shall be brought within two years following publication of the notice pursuant to subsection A; however, the failure of a person claiming ownership of such lands to commence an action within the two-year period as provided in this subsection shall not bar such person from asserting a claim of ownership as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1509/'>28.2-1509</a>.</p><p>C. If an action is not commenced within the two-year period as provided in subsection B, the Commission may file an amended or supplemental inventory designating as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands the parcels as to which no action has been commenced. Upon filing the amended or supplemental inventory, the Commission shall cause to be published a notice as provided in subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1507/'>28.2-1507</a>.</p><p>D. If an action is commenced within the two-year period as provided in subsection B, the Commission shall not, during the pendency of the action, file an amended or supplemental inventory designating the land which is the subject of the action as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands. Upon the entry of a final judgment ruling that any of such land is not the property of the Commonwealth, the Commission shall correct the amended or supplemental inventory to remove any designation of such land as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowland. The Commission may then file the corrected amended or supplemental inventory. Upon the entry of a final judgment ruling that such land is the property of the Commonwealth, the Commission may file an amended or supplemental inventory designating such land as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, and further such final judgment shall bar the assertion of a like claim in any action brought to assert ownership of such land pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1509/'>28.2-1509</a>. Upon filing an amended or supplemental inventory, the Commission shall cause to be published the notice as provided in subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1507/'>28.2-1507</a>.</p><p>1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0850'>850</a>.</p>
