# § 10.1-606.3  Requirement for development in dam break inundation zones.

<p>A. For any development proposed within the boundaries of a dam break inundation zone that has been mapped in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/10.1-606.2/'>10.1-606.2</a>, the locality shall, as part of a preliminary plan review pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2260/'>15.2-2260</a>, or as part of a plan review pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2259/'>15.2-2259</a> if no preliminary review has been conducted, (i) review the dam break inundation zone map on file with the locality for the affected impounding structure, (ii) notify the dam owner, and (iii) within 10 days forward a request to the Department of Conservation and Recreation to make a determination of the potential impacts of the proposed development on the spillway design flood standards required of the dam. The Department shall notify the dam owner and the locality of its determination within 45 days of the receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the Department's determination, the locality shall complete the review in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2259/'>15.2-2259</a> or <a href='/vacode/15.2-2260/'>15.2-2260</a>. If a locality has not received a determination within 45 days of the Department's receipt of the request, the Department shall be deemed to have no comments, and the locality shall complete its review. Such inaction by the Department shall not affect the Board's authority to regulate the impounding structure in accordance with this article.</p><p>If the Department determines that the plan of development would change the spillway design flood standards of the impounding structure, the locality shall not permit development as defined in § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2201/'>15.2-2201</a> or redevelopment in the dam break inundation zone unless the developer or subdivider agrees to alter the plan of development so that it does not alter the spillway design flood standard required of the impounding structure or he contributes payment to the necessary upgrades to the affected impounding structure pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2243.1/'>15.2-2243.1</a>.</p><p>The developer or subdivider shall provide the dam owner and all affected localities with information necessary for the dam owner to update the dam break inundation zone map to reflect any new development within the dam break inundation zone following completion of the development.</p><p>The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to any development proposed downstream of a dam for which a dam break inundation zone map is not on file with the locality as of the time of the official submission of a development plan to the locality.</p><p>B. The locality is authorized to map the dam break inundation zone in accordance with criteria set out in the Virginia Impounding Structure Regulations (4VAC50-20) and recover the costs of such mapping from the owner of an impounding structure for which a dam break inundation zone map is not on file with the locality and a map has not been prepared by the impounding structure owner.</p><p>C. This section shall not be construed to supersede or conflict with the authority granted to the Department of Energy for the regulation of mineral extraction activities in the Commonwealth as set out in Title 45.2. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to permit the impairment of a vested right in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2307/'>15.2-2307</a>.</p><p>2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0491'>491</a>; 2021, Sp.
