# ยง 10.1-418.2 St. Mary's State Scenic River.

<p>A. Because the authority of the federal government over the St. Mary's River prevents the Commonwealth from legally including the river as a component of the Virginia Scenic Rivers System, the segment of the St. Mary's River from its headwaters to the border of the George Washington National Forest, all on national forest property, is hereby recognized as one of Virginia's Scenic River resources and is worthy of designation as such.</p><p>B. The Department shall consult with the Augusta County Board of Supervisors and the Supervisor of the George Washington National Forest on matters related to this scenic river.</p><p>2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0240'>240</a>; 2018, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0273'>273</a>.</p>
