# ยง 10.1-1425.20 Findings and intent.

<p>A. The General Assembly finds that:</p><p>1. The management of solid waste can pose a wide range of hazards to public health and safety and to the environment;</p><p>2. Packaging comprises a significant percentage of the overall waste stream;</p><p>3. The presence of heavy metals in packaging is a concern because of the potential presence of heavy metals in residue from manufacturers' recycling processes, in emissions or ash when packaging is incinerated, or in leachate when packaging is landfilled; and</p><p>4. Lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern.</p><p>B. It is the intent of the General Assembly to:</p><p>1. Reduce the toxicity of packaging;</p><p>2. Eliminate the addition of heavy metals to packaging; and</p><p>3. Achieve reductions in toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of recovered material in the production of products, packaging, and its components.</p><p>1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0944'>944</a>.</p>
