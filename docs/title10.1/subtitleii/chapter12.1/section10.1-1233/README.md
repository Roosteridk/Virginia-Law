# ยง 10.1-1233 Amnesty for voluntary disclosure and restoration of brownfield sites.

<p>The Director may, consistent with programs developed under the federal acts, provide incentives for the voluntary disclosure of brownfield sites and related information regarding potential or known contamination at that site. To the extent consistent with federal law, any person making a voluntary disclosure regarding real or potential contamination at a brownfield site shall not be assessed an administrative or civil penalty under the Virginia Waste Management Act (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1400/'>10.1-1400</a> et seq.), the State Water Control Law (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.2/'>62.1-44.2</a> et seq.), the State Air Pollution Control Law (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1300/'>10.1-1300</a> et seq.), or any other applicable law. A disclosure is voluntary if it is not otherwise required by law, regulation, permit or administrative order and the person making the disclosure adopts a plan to market for redevelopment or otherwise ensure the timely remediation of the site. Immunity shall not be accorded if it is found that the person making the voluntary disclosure has acted in bad faith.</p><p>2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0378'>378</a>.</p>
