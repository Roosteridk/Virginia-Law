# ยง 10.1-2118 Cooperative program established.

<p>It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth, and it is the purpose of this chapter, to restore and improve the quality of state waters and to protect them from impairment and destruction for the benefit of current and future citizens of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further determines and finds that the quality of state waters is subject to potential pollution and degradation, including excess nutrients, from both point and nonpoint source pollution and that the purposes of the State Water Control Law (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.2/'>62.1-44.2</a> et seq.) and all other laws related to the restoration, protection and improvement of the quality of state waters will be enhanced by the implementation of the provisions of this chapter. The General Assembly further determines and finds that the restoration, protection and improvement of the quality of state waters is a shared responsibility among state and local governments and individuals and to that end this chapter establishes cooperative programs related to nutrient reduction and other point and nonpoint sources of pollution.</p><p>1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0021'>21</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0625'>625</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0626'>626</a>.</p>
