# ยง 10.1-2003 Terms of members; vacancies.

<p>The members of the Board shall be appointed for terms of five years each, except that the initial appointments to the Board shall be for such terms of less than five years as may be necessary to stagger the expiration of terms so that the terms of not more than seven members expire in any one year. Members of the Board may be suspended or removed by the Governor at his pleasure and the unexpired term of any member shall lapse upon his failure for any reason to attend four consecutive regular meetings of the Board. The initial appointments of members for terms of less than five years shall be deemed appointments to fill vacancies. No person shall be eligible to serve for or during more than two successive terms; however, any person appointed to fill a vacancy may be eligible for two additional successive terms after the term of the vacancy for which he was appointed has expired. The members of the Board shall receive no salaries.</p><p>1988, cc. 707, 891; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0163'>163</a>.</p>
