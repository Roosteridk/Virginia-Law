# ยง 16.1-333.1 Written findings necessary to order that minor is emancipated on the basis of intent to marry.

<p>The court may enter an order declaring such a minor who desires to get married emancipated if, after a hearing where both individuals intending to marry are present, the court makes written findings that:</p><p>1. It is the minor's own will that the minor enter into marriage, and the minor is not being compelled against the minor's will by force, threats, persuasions, menace, or duress;</p><p>2. The individuals to be married are mature enough to make such a decision to marry;</p><p>3. The marriage will not endanger the safety of the minor. In making this finding, the court shall consider (i) the age difference between the parties intending to be married; (ii) whether either individual to be married has a criminal record containing any conviction of an act of violence, as defined in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-297.1/'>19.2-297.1</a>, or any conviction of a barrier crime, as defined in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-392.02/'>19.2-392.02</a>; and (iii) any history of violence between the parties to be married; and</p><p>4. It is in the best interests of the minor petitioning for an order of emancipation that such order be entered. Neither a past or current pregnancy of either individual to be married or between the individuals to be married nor the wishes of the parents or legal guardians of the minor desiring to be married shall be sufficient evidence to establish that the best interests of the minor would be served by entering the order of emancipation.</p><p>2016, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0457'>457</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0543'>543</a>; 2017, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0809'>809</a>.</p>
