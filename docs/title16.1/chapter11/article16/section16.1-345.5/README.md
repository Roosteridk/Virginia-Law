The court shall grant the motion for review and enter an appropriate order without further hearing if it is joined by (i) the minor's parents and the minor if he is 14 years of age or older, or (ii) the minor's parents if the minor is younger than 14 years of age. If the minor's parents and the minor, if necessary, do not join the motion, the court shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing in accordance with subsection A of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.4/'>16.1-345.4</a>.</p><p>C.
