If an alternative facility is identified and agrees to accept the minor for temporary detention, the state facility shall notify the community services board, and an employee or designee of the community services board shall designate the alternative facility on the prescreening report.</p><p>C. The facility of temporary detention designated in accordance with this section shall be one that has been approved pursuant to regulations of the State Board of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</p><p>2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0691'>691</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0773'>773</a>; 2015, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0121'>121</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0309'>309</a>.</p>
