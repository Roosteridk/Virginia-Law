If the court finds the juvenile incompetent but restorable to competency, it may order continued restoration services for additional three-month periods, provided a hearing pursuant to subsection F of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/'>16.1-356</a> is held at the completion of each such period and the juvenile continues to be incompetent but restorable to competency in the foreseeable future.</p><p>C. If, at any time after the juvenile is ordered to undergo services under subsection A of this section, the agent providing restoration believes the juvenile's competency is restored, the agent shall immediately send a report to the court as prescribed in subsection E of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/'>16.1-356</a>.
