# § 16.1-88.2 Evidence of medical reports, statements, or records; testimony of health care provider or custodian of records.

<p>In a civil suit tried in a general district court or appealed to the circuit court to recover damages for personal injuries or to resolve any dispute with an insurance company or health care provider, either party may present evidence as to the extent, nature, and treatment of the injury, the examination of the person so injured, and the costs of such treatment and examination by the following:</p><p>1. A report or statement from the treating or examining health care provider as defined in § <a href='/vacode/8.01-581.1/'>8.01-581.1</a> or a health care provider licensed outside of the Commonwealth for his treatment of the plaintiff outside of the Commonwealth. Such report or statement shall be admitted if the party intending to present such evidence gives the opposing party or parties a copy of such evidence and written notice of such intention 10 days in advance of trial and if attached to or contained in such evidence is a sworn declaration of (i) the treating or examining health care provider that (a) the person named therein was treated or examined by such health care provider, (b) the information contained in the report or statement is true and accurate and fully descriptive as to the nature and extent of the injury, and (c) any statement of costs contained in the report or statement is true and accurate or (ii) the custodian of such report or statement that the same is a true and accurate copy of the report or statement; or</p><p>2. The bills as defined in subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-413.01/'>8.01-413.01</a> or records of a treating or examining health care provider as defined in § <a href='/vacode/8.01-581.1/'>8.01-581.1</a> or a health care provider licensed outside of the Commonwealth for its treatment of the plaintiff outside of the Commonwealth. Such provider's records or bills shall be admitted if (i) the party intending to present evidence by the use of records or bills gives the opposing party or parties a copy of the records or bills and written notice of such intention 10 days in advance of trial and (ii) attached to the records or bills is a sworn declaration of the custodian thereof that the same is a true and accurate copy of the records or bills of such provider.</p><p>If, thereafter, the plaintiff or defendant summons the health care provider or custodian making such statement to testify in proper person or by deposition, the court shall determine which party shall pay the fee and costs for such appearance or depositions, or may apportion the same among the parties in such proportions as the ends of justice may require. If such health care provider or custodian is not subject to subpoena for cross-examination in court or by a deposition, then the court shall allow a reasonable opportunity for the party seeking the subpoena for such health care provider or custodian to obtain his testimony as the ends of justice may require. The plaintiff may only present evidence pursuant to this section in circuit court if he has not requested an amount in excess of the ad damnum in the motion for judgment filed in the general district court.</p><p>1978, c. 490; 1983, c. 616; 1985, c. 379; 1989, c. 563; 1990, c. 279; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0749'>749</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0811'>811</a>; 2007, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0425'>425</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0869'>869</a>; 2013, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0078'>78</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0145'>145</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0025'>25</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0085'>85</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0446'>446</a>; 2022, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0469'>469</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0470'>470</a>.</p>
