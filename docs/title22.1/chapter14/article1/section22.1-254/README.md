Further, in the case of any five-year-old child who is subject to the provisions of this subsection, the requirements of this section may be alternatively satisfied by causing the child to attend any public educational pre-kindergarten program, including a Head Start program, or in a private, denominational, or parochial educational pre-kindergarten program.</p><p>Instruction in the home of a child or children by the parent, guardian, or other person having control or charge of such child or children shall not be classified or defined as a private, denominational or parochial school.</p><p>The requirements of this section shall apply to (i) any child in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice or the Department of Corrections who has not passed his eighteenth birthday and (ii) any child whom the division superintendent has required to take a special program of prevention, intervention, or remediation as provided in subsection C of § <a href='/vacode/22.1-253.13:1/'>22.1-253.13:1</a> and in § <a href='/vacode/22.1-254.01/'>22.1-254.01</a>. The requirements of this section shall not apply to (a) any person 16 through 18 years of age who is housed in an adult correctional facility when such person is actively pursuing the achievement of a passing score on a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board but is not enrolled in an individual student alternative education plan pursuant to subsection E, and (b) any child who has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent, a certificate of completion, or has achieved a passing score on a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board, or who has otherwise complied with compulsory school attendance requirements as set forth in this article.</p><p>B. A school board shall excuse from attendance at school:</p><p>1. Any pupil who, together with his parents, by reason of bona fide religious training or belief is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school. For purposes of this subdivision, "bona fide religious training or belief" does not include essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code; and</p><p>2. On the recommendation of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the county or city in which the pupil resides and for such period of time as the court deems appropriate, any pupil who, together with his parents, is opposed to attendance at a school by reason of concern for such pupil's health, as verified by competent medical evidence, or by reason of such pupil's reasonable apprehension for personal safety when such concern or apprehension in that pupil's specific case is determined by the court, upon consideration of the recommendation of the principal and division superintendent, to be justified.</p><p>C. Each local school board shall develop policies for excusing students who are absent by reason of observance of a religious holiday. Such policies shall ensure that a student shall not be deprived of any award or of eligibility or opportunity to compete for any award, or of the right to take an alternate test or examination, for any which he missed by reason of such absence, if the absence is verified in a manner acceptable to the school board.</p><p>D. A school board may excuse from attendance at school:</p><p>1. On recommendation of the principal and the division superintendent and with the written consent of the parent or guardian, any pupil who the school board determines, in accordance with regulations of the Board, cannot benefit from education at such school; or</p><p>2. On recommendation of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the county or city in which the pupil resides, any pupil who, in the judgment of such court, cannot benefit from education at such school.</p><p>E. Local school boards may allow the requirements of subsection A to be met under the following conditions:</p><p>For a student who is at least 16 years of age, there shall be a meeting of the student, the student's parents, and the principal or his designee of the school in which the student is enrolled in which an individual student alternative education plan shall be developed in conformity with guidelines prescribed by the Board, which plan must include:</p><p>1. Career guidance counseling;</p><p>2. Mandatory enrollment and attendance in a preparatory program for passing a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board or other alternative education program approved by the local school board with attendance requirements that provide for reporting of student attendance by the chief administrator of such preparatory program or approved alternative education program to such principal or his designee;</p><p>3. Mandatory enrollment in a program to earn a Board-approved career and technical education credential, such as the successful completion of an industry certification, a state licensure examination, a national occupational competency assessment, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or the Virginia workplace readiness skills assessment;</p><p>4. Successful completion of the course in economics and personal finance required to earn a Board-approved high school diploma;</p><p>5. Counseling on the economic impact of failing to complete high school; and</p><p>6. Procedures for reenrollment to comply with the requirements of subsection A.</p><p>A student for whom an individual student alternative education plan has been granted pursuant to this subsection and who fails to comply with the conditions of such plan shall be in violation of the compulsory school attendance law, and the division superintendent or attendance officer of the school division in which such student was last enrolled shall seek immediate compliance with the compulsory school attendance law as set forth in this article.</p><p>Students enrolled with an individual student alternative education plan shall be counted in the average daily membership of the school division.</p><p>F. A school board may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 3 (§ <a href='/vacode/22.1-276.01/'>22.1-276.01</a> et seq.) of Chapter 14 and upon a finding that a school-age child has been (i) charged with an offense relating to the Commonwealth's laws, or with a violation of school board policies, on weapons, alcohol or drugs, or intentional injury to another person; (ii) found guilty or not innocent of a crime that resulted in or could have resulted in injury to others, or of an offense that is required to be disclosed to the superintendent of the school division pursuant to subsection G of § <a href='/vacode/16.1-260/'>16.1-260</a>; (iii) suspended pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.05/'>22.1-277.05</a>; or (iv) expelled from school attendance pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.06/'>22.1-277.06</a> or <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.07/'>22.1-277.07</a> or subsection C of § <a href='/vacode/22.1-277/'>22.1-277</a>, require the child to attend an alternative education program as provided in § <a href='/vacode/22.1-209.1:2/'>22.1-209.1:2</a> or <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.2:1/'>22.1-277.2:1</a>.</p><p>G. Whenever a court orders any pupil into an alternative education program, including a program preparing students for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board, offered in the public schools, the local school board of the school division in which the program is offered shall determine the appropriate alternative education placement of the pupil, regardless of whether the pupil attends the public schools it supervises or resides within its school division.</p><p>The juvenile and domestic relations district court of the county or city in which a pupil resides or in which charges are pending against a pupil, or any court in which charges are pending against a pupil, may require the pupil who has been charged with (i) a crime that resulted in or could have resulted in injury to others, (ii) a violation of Article 1 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-77/'>18.2-77</a> et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 18.2, or (iii) any offense related to possession or distribution of any Schedule I, II, or III controlled substances to attend an alternative education program, including, but not limited to, night school, adult education, or any other education program designed to offer instruction to students for whom the regular program of instruction may be inappropriate.</p><p>This subsection shall not be construed to limit the authority of school boards to expel, suspend, or exclude students, as provided in §§ <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.04/'>22.1-277.04</a>, <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.05/'>22.1-277.05</a>, <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.06/'>22.1-277.06</a>, <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.07/'>22.1-277.07</a>, and <a href='/vacode/22.1-277.2/'>22.1-277.2</a>. As used in this subsection, the term "charged" means that a petition or warrant has been filed or is pending against a pupil.</p><p>H.

Children excused pursuant to subsections B and D.</p><p>Further, any child who will not have reached his sixth birthday on or before September 30 of each school year whose parent or guardian notifies the appropriate school board that he does not wish the child to attend school until the following year because the child, in the opinion of the parent or guardian, is not mentally, physically, or emotionally prepared to attend school, may delay the child's attendance for one year.</p><p>The distances specified in subdivisions 3 and 4 shall be measured or determined from the child's residence to the entrance to the school grounds or to the school bus stop nearest the entrance to the residence of such children by the nearest practical routes which are usable for walking or riding.

Subject to guidelines established by the Department, any student who is absent from school due to his mental or behavioral health shall be granted an excused absence.</p><p>K. Subject to guidelines established by the Department, each school board (i) shall permit one school day-long excused absence per school year for any middle school or high school student in the local school division who is absent from school to engage in a civic event and (ii) may permit additional excused absences for such students who are absent for such purpose.
