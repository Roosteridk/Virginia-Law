A parent, guardian or other person having control or charge of a student in a public school and, with consent of a parent or in compliance with a court order, the court in which the disposition was rendered, shall be notified in writing of any disciplinary action taken with regard to any incident upon which the adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense listed in subsection G of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/'>16.1-260</a> was based and the reasons therefor.
