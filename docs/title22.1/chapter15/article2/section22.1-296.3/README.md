<p>A. As a condition of employment, the governing boards or administrators of private elementary or secondary schools that are accredited pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/22.1-19/'>22.1-19</a> shall require any applicant who accepts employment, whether full time or part time or permanent or temporary, to submit to fingerprinting and to provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the applicant's fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such applicant.</p><p>The Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an applicant's record or notification that no record exists, shall report to the governing board or administrator, or to a private organization coordinating such records on behalf of such governing board or administrator pursuant to a written agreement with the Department of State Police, that the applicant meets the criteria or does not meet the criteria for employment based on whether or not the applicant has ever been convicted of any barrier crime as defined in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.02/'>19.2-392.02</a>.</p><p>B. The Central Criminal Records Exchange shall not disclose information to such governing board, administrator, or private organization coordinating such records regarding charges or convictions of any crimes. If any applicant is denied employment because of information appearing on the criminal history record and the applicant disputes the information upon which the denial was based, the Central Criminal Records Exchange shall, upon request, furnish the applicant the procedures for obtaining a copy of the criminal history record from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The information provided to the governing board, administrator, or private organization coordinating such records shall not be disseminated except as provided in this section. A governing board or administrator employing or previously employing a temporary teacher or a private organization coordinating such records on behalf of such governing board or administrator pursuant to a written agreement with the Department of State Police may disseminate, at the written request of such temporary teacher, whether such teacher meets the criteria or does not meet the criteria for employment pursuant to subsection A to the governing board or administrator of another accredited private elementary or secondary school in which such teacher has accepted employment. Such governing board, administrator, or private organization transferring criminal records information pursuant to this section shall be immune from civil liability for any official act, decision, or omission done or made in the performance of such transfer, when such acts or omissions are taken in good faith and are not the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>Fees charged for the processing and administration of background checks pursuant to this section shall not exceed the actual cost to the state of such processing and administration.</p><p>C.
