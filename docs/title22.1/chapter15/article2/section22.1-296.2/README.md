# § 22.1-296.2 Fingerprinting required; reciprocity permitted.

<p>A. As a condition of employment, the school boards of the Commonwealth shall require any applicant who is offered or accepts employment, whether full time or part time or permanent or temporary, to submit to fingerprinting and to provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the applicant's fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such applicant. The school board may (i) pay for all or a portion of the cost of the fingerprinting or criminal records check or (ii) in its discretion, require the applicant to pay for all or a portion of the cost of such fingerprinting or criminal records check.</p><p>The Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an applicant's record or notification that no record exists, shall report to the school board whether or not the applicant has ever been convicted of a felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor or an equivalent offense in another state.</p><p>To conserve the costs of conducting criminal history record checks to applicants and school boards, upon the written request and permission of the applicant, a school board shall inform another school board with which reciprocity has been established, and to which the applicant also has applied for employment, of the results of the criminal history record information conducted within the previous 90 days that it obtained concerning the applicant. Criminal history record information pertaining to an applicant for employment by a school board shall be exchanged only between school boards in the Commonwealth in which a current agreement of reciprocity for the exchange of such information has been established and is in effect. Reciprocity agreements between school boards shall provide for the apportionment of the costs of the fingerprinting or criminal records check between the applicant and the school board, as prescribed in this section. However, school boards that enter into reciprocity agreements shall not each levy the costs of the fingerprinting or criminal records check on the applicant.</p><p>B. The division superintendent shall inform the relevant school board of any notification of arrest of a school board employee received pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-83.1/'>19.2-83.1</a>. The school board shall require such employee, whether full time or part time or permanent or temporary, to submit to fingerprinting and to provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the employee's fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such employee. The school board may (i) pay for all or a portion of the cost of the fingerprinting or criminal records check or (ii) in its discretion, require the applicant to pay for all or a portion of the cost of such fingerprinting or criminal records check.</p><p>The Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an employee's record or notification that no record exists, shall report to the school board whether or not the employee has been convicted of any of the offenses listed in subsection A. The contents of the employee's record shall be used by the school board solely to implement the provisions of §§ <a href='/vacode/22.1-307/'>22.1-307</a> and <a href='/vacode/22.1-315/'>22.1-315</a>.</p><p>C. The Central Criminal Records Exchange shall not disclose information to the school board regarding charges or convictions of any crimes not specified in this section. If an applicant is denied employment or a current employee is suspended or dismissed because of information appearing on his criminal history record, the school board shall provide a copy of the information obtained from the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the applicant or employee. The information provided to the school board shall not be disseminated except as provided in this section.</p><p>1988, c. 851; 1989, c. 544; 1990, c. 766; 1991, c. 342; 1992, cc. 641, 791; 1993, cc. 210, 458; 1994, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0232'>232</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0782'>782</a>; 1995, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0731'>731</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0781'>781</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0809'>809</a>; 1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0396'>396</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0467'>467</a>; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0444'>444</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0721'>721</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0412'>412</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0448'>448</a>; 2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0683'>683</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0774'>774</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0811'>811</a>; 2001, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0591'>591</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0677'>677</a>; 2022, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0355'>355</a>.</p>
