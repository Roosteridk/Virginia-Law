No later than June 1, 2023, the advisory committee shall recommend language developmental milestones for inclusion in the parent resource and may make recommendations for tools or assessments to be included in an educator resource set forth in subsection E for use in assessing the language and literacy development of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing. No later than June 30, 2023, the Department, in consultation with the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, shall select language developmental milestones for inclusion in the parent resource and inform the advisory committee of its selections.</p><p>D. The Department, in consultation with the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, shall, after considering the recommendations submitted by the advisory committee, select language developmental milestones for inclusion in a resource, and develop such resource, for use by parents of a child from birth to age five who is identified as deaf or hard of hearing to monitor and track the child's expressive and receptive language acquisition and developmental stages toward English literacy. Such parent resource shall:</p><p>1. Be appropriate for use, in both content and administration, with children who use American Sign Language, English, or both;</p><p>2. Present the language developmental milestones selected pursuant to subsection C in terms of typical development of all children in a particular age range;</p><p>3. Be written for clarity and ease of use by parents;</p><p>4.

Make clear that parents have the right to select American Sign Language, English, or both for their child's language acquisition and developmental milestones;</p><p>6. Make clear that the parent resource is not a formal assessment of language and literacy development and that parents' observations of their child may differ from formal assessment data presented at an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) or Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting;</p><p>7. Explain that parents may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or IEP meeting for purposes of sharing their observations about their child's development; and</p><p>8. Include fair, balanced, and comprehensive information about American Sign Language and English and respective communication modes as well as available services and programs.</p><p>The Department, the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing, and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall jointly disseminate the resource to parents of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>E. The Department, in coordination with the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, shall, after considering any recommendations submitted by the advisory committee, select existing tools or assessments for early intervention specialists and educators for use in assessing the language and literacy development of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing.

In addition to the powers and duties set forth above, the advisory committee may:</p><p>1. Advise the Department, the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing, and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services or its contractor on the content and administration of the existing instrument used to assess the development of children who are deaf or hard of hearing in order to ensure the appropriate use of such instrument for the assessment of the language and literacy development of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing; and</p><p>2. Make recommendations regarding future research to improve the measurement of the language and literacy development of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>G. If a child from birth to age five who is deaf or hard of hearing does not demonstrate progress in expressive and receptive language skills as measured by one of the educator tools or assessments selected pursuant to subsection E or by the existing instrument used to assess the development of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, such child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing toward the language developmental milestones and shall recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that shall be provided to assist the child's progress toward English literacy.</p><p>H. No later than August 1, 2024, and no later than August 1 of each year thereafter, the Department, in coordination with the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, shall produce a report, using existing data reported in compliance with the federally required state performance plan on students with disabilities, that compares the language and literacy development of children from birth to age five who are deaf or hard of hearing with the language and literacy development of their peers who are not deaf or hard of hearing and shall make such report available to the public on its website.</p><p>I.
