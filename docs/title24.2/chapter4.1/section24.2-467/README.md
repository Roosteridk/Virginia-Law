If a voter's mistake or omission in the completion of a document under this chapter does not prevent determining whether a covered voter is eligible to vote, the mistake or omission does not invalidate the document. Failure to satisfy a nonsubstantive requirement, such as using paper or envelopes of a specified size or weight, does not invalidate a document submitted under this chapter. In a federal write-in absentee ballot authorized by this chapter, if the intention of the voter is discernible under this state's uniform definition of what constitutes a vote, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party must be accepted as a valid vote.</p><p>B. Notarization is not required for the execution of a document under this chapter. An authentication, other than the declaration specified in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-463/'>24.2-463</a> or the declaration on the federal postcard application and federal write-in absentee ballot, is not required for execution of a document under this chapter.
