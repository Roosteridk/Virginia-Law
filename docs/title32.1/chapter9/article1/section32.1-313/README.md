# ยง 32.1-313 Liability for excess benefits or payments obtained without intent to violate chapter.

<p>A. Any person, agency or institution, but not including an individual medical assistance recipient of health care, that, without intent to violate this chapter, whether under contract or otherwise, obtains benefits or payments where the Commonwealth directly or indirectly provides any portion of the benefits or payments under medical assistance to which such person, agency or institution is not entitled, or in a greater amount than that to which entitled, shall be liable for (i) any excess benefits or payments received, and (ii) interest on the amount of the excess benefits or payments at the judgment rate as defined in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-302/'>6.2-302</a> from the date upon which such person, agency, or institution knew or reasonably should have known that it had received excess benefits or payments to the date upon which repayment is made to the Commonwealth. No person, agency or institution shall be liable for payment of interest, however, when excess benefits or payments were obtained as a result of errors made solely by the Department of Medical Assistance Services. Whenever a penalty or interest is due under this section or ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-312/'>32.1-312</a>, such penalty or interest shall not be reimbursable by the Commonwealth as an allowable cost under any of the provisions of this chapter.</p><p>B. A civil action under this section shall be brought (i) within six years of the date on which the violation was committed, or (ii) within three years of the date when an official of the Commonwealth charged with the responsibility to act in the circumstances discovered or reasonably should have discovered the facts material to the cause of action. However, in no event shall the limitations period extend more than 10 years from the date on which the violation was committed.</p><p>1981, c. 255; 1986, c. 551; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0569'>569</a>.</p>
