# ยง 32.1-276.2 Health care data reporting; purpose.

<p>The General Assembly finds that the establishment of effective health care data analysis and reporting initiatives is essential to improving the quality and efficiency of health care, fostering competition among health care providers, and increasing consumer choice with regard to health care services in the Commonwealth, and that accurate and valuable health care data can best be identified by representatives of state government and the consumer, provider, insurance, and business communities. For this reason, the State Board of Health and the State Health Commissioner, assisted by the State Department of Health and the Bureau of Insurance, shall administer the health care data reporting initiatives established by this chapter.</p><p>1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0902'>902</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0416'>416</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0693'>693</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0709'>709</a>.</p>
