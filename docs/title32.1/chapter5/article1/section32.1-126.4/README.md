<p>A.

Any standing order or protocol authorized by this section shall require that the vaccinations be administered in accordance with the most recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after (i) ascertaining that the vaccination is not medically contraindicated for the patient, (ii) determining the patient's wishes and any religious objections, and (iii) obtaining informed consent from the patient or his legal representative.</p><p>C. Vaccinations administered under a standing order or protocol shall be documented in the patient's health record.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0432'>432</a>.</p>
