A tax is hereby imposed upon every generation skipping transfer where the original transferor is not a resident of Virginia at the date of the original transfer, but where the generation skipping transfer includes real or personal property having a situs in Virginia, in an amount equal to the amount allowable as a credit for state legacy taxes under § 2604 of the Internal Revenue Code, reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the total state tax credit allowable for federal generation skipping transfer tax purposes as the value of the transferred property taxable by all other states bears to the value of the gross generation skipping transfer for federal generation skipping transfer tax purposes. In any case in which a tax is imposed on a generation skipping transfer by Virginia and by one or more other states or the District of Columbia, the Commissioner shall negotiate with the taxing authorities of such other state, states, or District of Columbia so that the aggregate amount of taxes imposed by Virginia and such other state, states or the District of Columbia on a generation skipping transfer does not exceed 100 percent of the amount allowable as credit for state legacy taxes under § 2604 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p>Code 1950, § 58-238.37; 1979, c. 559; 1984, c. 675; 1987, c. 484.</p>
