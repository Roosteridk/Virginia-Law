<p>A. The Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Commissioner of Social Services shall certify to the Department of Taxation, or in the case of business firms subject to a tax under Article 1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2500/'>58.1-2500</a> et seq.) of Chapter 25 or Article 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2620/'>58.1-2620</a> et seq.) of Chapter 26, to the State Corporation Commission, the applicability of the tax credit provided herein for a business firm.</p><p>B. A business firm shall be eligible for a credit against the taxes imposed by Articles 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-320/'>58.1-320</a> et seq.), 6 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-360/'>58.1-360</a> et seq.), and 10 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-400/'>58.1-400</a> et seq.) of Chapter 3, Chapter 12 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1200/'>58.1-1200</a> et seq.), Article 1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2500/'>58.1-2500</a> et seq.) of Chapter 25, or Article 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2620/'>58.1-2620</a> et seq.) of Chapter 26, in an amount equal to 65 percent of the value of the money, property, professional services, and contracting services donated by the business firm during its taxable year to neighborhood organizations for programs approved pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.20/'>58.1-439.20</a>. Notwithstanding any other law and for purposes of this article, the value of a motor vehicle donated by a business firm shall, in all cases, be such value as determined for federal income tax purposes using the laws and regulations of the United States relating to federal income taxes. No tax credit shall be granted for any donation made in the taxable year with a value of less than $616.</p><p>A business firm shall be eligible for a tax credit under this section only to the extent that sufficient tax credits allocated to the neighborhood organization for an approved project are available. Notwithstanding that this section establishes a tax credit of 65 percent of the value of the qualified donation, a business firm may by written agreement accept a lesser tax credit percentage from a neighborhood organization for any otherwise qualified donation it has made. No tax credit shall be granted to any business firm for donations to a neighborhood organization providing job training or education for individuals employed by the business firm. Any tax credit not usable for the taxable year the donation was made may be carried over to the extent usable for the next five succeeding taxable years or until the full credit has been utilized, whichever is sooner. Credits granted to a partnership, electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation, or limited liability company shall be allocated to their individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.</p><p>C. A tax credit shall be issued by the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Commissioner of Social Services to a business firm upon receipt of a certification made by a neighborhood organization to whom tax credits were allocated for an approved program pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.20/'>58.1-439.20</a>. The certification shall identify the type and value of the donation received, the business firm making the donation, and the tax credit percentage to be used in determining the amount of the tax credit. The certification shall also include any written agreement under which a business firm accepts a tax credit of less than 65 percent for a donation.</p><p>1981, c. 629, § 63.1-324; 1982, c. 178; 1984, c. 720; 1986, c. 407; 1989, c. 310; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0279'>279</a>; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0077'>77</a>; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0229'>229</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0640'>640</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0890'>890</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0909'>909</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747'>747</a>, § 63.2-2003; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0585'>585</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0851'>851</a>; 2011, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0370'>370</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0731'>731</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0842'>842</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0056'>56</a>.</p>
