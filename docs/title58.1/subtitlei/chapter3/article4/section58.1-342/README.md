<p>A.

His only income from Virginia sources was from salaries and wages;</p><p>2. Such salaries and wages were subject to income taxation by the state of his residence under an income tax law substantially similar in principle to this chapter;</p><p>3. The laws of such other state contain a provision substantially similar in effect to that contained in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-332/'>58.1-332</a> and applicable to residents of Virginia; and</p><p>4. The laws of such other state accord like treatment to a resident of this Commonwealth who commuted on a daily basis from his place of residence in Virginia to his place of employment in such other state.</p><p>B. The Department may enter into reciprocal agreements with other states to exempt nonresidents from the Virginia income tax if such other states similarly exempt Virginia residents. Under such reciprocal agreements nonresidents are not required to pay tax or file a return with, nor be subject to withholding by, the reciprocating state on compensation paid in that state or on income distributed by a trust domiciled in that state.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 58-151.063; 1971, Ex.
