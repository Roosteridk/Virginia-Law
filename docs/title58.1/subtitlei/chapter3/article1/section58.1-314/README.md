<p>Upon the completion of all acts necessary to effect a jeopardy assessment under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-313/'>58.1-313</a> and upon the failure of the taxpayer to make payment in full upon demand of all taxes, penalties and interest immediately due thereunder or post a bond in lieu thereof when applicable, such assessment shall be a lien upon and bind the real and personal property of the delinquent taxpayer against whom it may be issued from the time the taxpayer fails to make full payment thereunder, except as against a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration. A notice of such lien, drawn by the Tax Commissioner, shall be sent to the clerk of the circuit court in all jurisdictions wherein the taxpayer is known or believed to own any estate. The clerk to whom any such notice of lien is so sent shall record it, as a judgment is required by law to be recorded, and shall index the same in the name of the Commonwealth as well as of the delinquent taxpayer. Such recordation shall thereupon be constructive notice of the lien created by the assessment as to all estate of the delinquent taxpayer located in such jurisdiction.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 58-151.077, 58-151.0106; 1971, Ex.
