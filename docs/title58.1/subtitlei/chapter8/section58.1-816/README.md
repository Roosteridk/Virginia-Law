If any revenues distributed to a county or city under clause (ii) of subsection B are applied or expended for any transportation facilities under the control and jurisdiction of any state agency, board, commission, or authority, such transportation facilities shall be constructed, operated, administered, improved, and maintained in accordance with laws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures governing such state agency, board, commission, or authority; however, in the event that these revenues, or a portion thereof, are expended for improving or constructing highways in a county that is subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/33.2-338/'>33.2-338</a>, such expenditures shall be undertaken in the manner prescribed in that statute.</p><p>E.
