# ยง 36-7.1 Liquidation of housing project.

<p>If the governing body of any county or city determines after a public hearing that the need for a housing project has ceased to exist and that such project should be liquidated it shall so notify the housing authority which shall proceed to liquidate the project following public advertisement of the sale thereof. Provided that no bid on such project shall be accepted which would result in a sum insufficient to meet the outstanding obligations of the authority with respect to such project and provided further that if the authority finds that the highest offered price is not as much as what it considers a fair value for the property, the authority shall notify the governing body of this fact. After such notification no further proceedings shall be had in the liquidation of the property except at the specific direction of the governing body.</p><p>1958, c. 83.</p>
