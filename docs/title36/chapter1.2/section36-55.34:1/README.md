The provisions of any agreements which provide for the regulation and supervision by HDA of any housing development or residential housing and any nonhousing buildings shall, when duly recorded among the land records of the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which the housing development or residential housing and any nonhousing buildings are located, run with the land and be binding on the successors and assigns of the owner thereof until released of record by HDA.</p><p>1975, c. 536; 1987, c. 164; 1991, c. 447; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0187'>187</a>.</p>
