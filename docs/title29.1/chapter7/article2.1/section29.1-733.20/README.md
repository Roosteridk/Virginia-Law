Except for a transfer described in subdivision 1 of the definition of "by operation of law," evidence that notification of the transfer and the intent to file the transfer-by-law statement has been sent to all persons indicated in the files of the Department as having an interest, including a security interest, in the watercraft; and</p><p>5.

Accept the statement;</p><p>2. Amend the files of the Department to reflect the transfer; and</p><p>3.
