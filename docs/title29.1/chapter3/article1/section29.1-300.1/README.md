Although a resident under the age of 12 is not required to obtain a license to hunt, any person under the age of 12, or an individual on his behalf, may purchase a Virginia hunting license or a junior lifetime hunting license pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/29.1-302.1/'>29.1-302.1</a>, without completing a hunter education program as required in subsection A, provided that no person under the age of 12 shall hunt unless accompanied and directly supervised by an adult who has, on his person, a valid Virginia hunting license.

For the purposes of this section, "adult" means the parent or legal guardian of the person under age 12, or such person over the age of 18 designated by the parent or legal guardian.</p><p>"Accompanied and directly supervised" means that the adult is within sight of the person under the age of 12.</p><p>C.
