<p>When the highway or bridge is established or altered, the county shall be chargeable with the compensation and damages to the proprietor or tenant and all costs incurred in the proceedings, provided that when the record shows that the sum allowed by the circuit court on appeal, as compensation and damages to any proprietor or tenant is not more than the amount allowed by the local governing body from whose decision the appeal was taken, such proprietor or tenant shall be adjudged to pay the costs occasioned by such appeal. When the local governing body decides against the application to establish or alter a highway or bridge, the applicant shall pay the costs incurred in the case, except the compensation of the viewers.</p><p>But when it shall appear to the local governing body that the opening and establishing or altering of such highway will be for mere private convenience, then the local governing body may order the same upon condition that such applicant pay, in whole or in part, the compensation and damages to the proprietor or tenant and the costs of the proceedings and keep the highway in order. In any such case the highway shall not be opened and established or altered until such compensation and damages and costs has been first paid or the written consent of the proprietor or tenant has been given.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 33-153; 1964, c. 565; 1970, c. 322, ยง 33.1-240; 2014, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0805'>805</a>.</p>
