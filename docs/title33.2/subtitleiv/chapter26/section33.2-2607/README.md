<p>Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this title and in accordance with all applicable federal statutes and requirements, the Commission shall control and operate and may impose and collect tolls in amounts established by the Commission for the use of any new or improved highway, bridge, or tunnel, to increase capacity on such facility or to address congestion within Planning District 23, constructed by the Commission (i) with federal, state, or local funds, (ii) solely with revenues of the Commission, or (iii) with revenues under the control of the Commission. The amount of any such toll may be varied from facility to facility, by lane, by congestion levels, by day of the week, by time of day, by type or size of vehicle, by number of axles, or by any similar combination thereof or any other factor the Commission may deem proper, and a reduced rate may be established for commuters as defined by the Commission. All such tolls shall be used for programs and projects that are reasonably related to or benefit the users of the new or improved highway, bridge, or tunnel, including, but not limited to, for the debt service and other costs of bonds whose proceeds are used for construction or improvement of such highway, bridge, or tunnel.</p><p>Any tolls imposed by the Commission shall be collected by an electronic toll system that, to the extent possible, shall not impede the traffic flow of the facility or prohibit a toll facility from retaining means of nonautomated toll collection in some lanes of the facility. For all facilities tolled by the Commission, there shall be signs erected prior to the point of toll collection that clearly state how the majority of the toll revenue is being spent by the Commission to benefit the users of the facility.</p><p>2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0545'>545</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0678'>678</a>.</p>
