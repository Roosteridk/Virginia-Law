The rate of the special improvements tax, when combined with all other special taxes in this Code of any kind imposed on land within the district, shall not be more than 25 cents ($0.25) per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3203/'>58.1-3203</a>; however, if all the owners in any district so request in writing, this limitation on rate shall not apply.
