The Program consists of the projects listed in clause (i) of subsection B of § <a href='/vacode/33.2-2400/'>33.2-2400</a>.</p><p>B. Allocations to the Program from the Fund shall be made annually by the Commonwealth Transportation Board for the creation and enhancement of a safe and efficient transportation system connecting the communities, businesses, places of employment, and residences of the Commonwealth, thereby enhancing the economic development potential, employment opportunities, mobility, and quality of life in the Commonwealth.</p><p>C. Except in the event that the Fund is insufficient to pay for the costs of the Program, allocations to the Program shall not diminish or replace allocations made from other sources or diminish allocations to which any district, system, or locality would be entitled under other provisions of this title but shall be supplemental to other allocations to the end that transportation improvements in the Northern Virginia Transportation District may be accelerated and augmented. Allocations under this subsection shall be limited to projects specified in subdivision 12 of § <a href='/vacode/33.2-1700/'>33.2-1700</a>.</p><p>D. The Commonwealth Transportation Board may expend such funds from all sources as may be lawfully available to initiate the Program and to support bonds and other obligations referenced in subsection E and in subsection D of § <a href='/vacode/33.2-2400/'>33.2-2400</a>.</p><p>E.
