Such proceedings shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of any and all laws of the Commonwealth applicable to the exercise of the power of eminent domain and subject to the provisions of Chapter 2 (ยง <a href='/vacode/25.1-200/'>25.1-200</a> et seq.) of Title 25.1.

Whenever the Authority makes such deposit in connection with any condemnation proceedings, the making of such deposit shall not preclude the Authority from appealing any decision rendered in such proceedings. Upon the deposit with the clerk of the court of the appraised price, any person entitled thereto may, upon petition to the court, be paid his or their pro rata share of 100 percent of such appraised price. The acceptance of such payment shall not preclude such person from appealing any decision rendered in such proceedings. If the appraisal is greater or less than the amount finally determined by the decision in such proceedings or by an appeal, the amount of the increase or decrease shall be paid or refunded to the Authority.</p><p>E. The acquisition of any such property by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain for the purposes provided herein shall be and is declared to be a public use of such property.</p><p>F.
