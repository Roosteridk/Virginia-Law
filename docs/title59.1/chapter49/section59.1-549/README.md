<p>A. Qualified business firms and qualified zone investors shall be eligible to receive enterprise zone incentive grants provided for in this chapter to the extent that they apply for and are approved for grant allocations through the Department.</p><p>B. If the sum of (i) the total amount of grants for which qualified business firms are eligible under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-547/'>59.1-547</a> plus (ii) the total amount of grants for which qualified zone investors are eligible under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-548/'>59.1-548</a> exceeds the total annual appropriation for the payment of all grants under this chapter for the relevant year, then the amount of the grant that each qualified business firm and qualified zone investor is eligible for shall be prorated in a proportional manner. The Department shall prioritize allocations to fully fund the grants under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-547/'>59.1-547</a> with any remaining funds to be allocated to grants under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-548/'>59.1-548</a>. In such cases, the amount of the grant that each qualified zone investor is eligible for under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-548/'>59.1-548</a> shall be prorated in a proportional manner based on the funds remaining in the annual appropriation after full payment of the grants under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-547/'>59.1-547</a>.</p><p>C. Qualified zone businesses and qualified zone investors shall make application to the Department each year for which they seek eligibility for enterprise zone incentive grants.

Business firms with base year employment of 100 or fewer permanent full-time positions and that create in a qualification year 25 or fewer grant eligible positions seeking to qualify for Job Creation Grants as provided for in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-547/'>59.1-547</a> shall be exempt from the attestation requirement for that qualification year.

Applicants for enterprise zone incentive grants under this chapter must have the local zone administrator verify that the location of their business or property is in the enterprise zone using a form supplied by the Department.
