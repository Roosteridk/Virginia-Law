<p>During any influenza vaccine shortage period, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or administer, or to offer to sell or administer, influenza vaccine at an unconscionable price within the Commonwealth. Actual sales at the increased price shall not be required for the increase to be considered unconscionable. In determining whether the price at which influenza vaccine is sold or administered is unconscionable, the following shall be considered:</p><p>1. Whether the price charged by the person for selling or administering the influenza vaccine grossly exceeded the price charged by the person therefor during the 10 days immediately prior to the commencement of the influenza vaccine shortage period; however, with respect to any person who was offering influenza vaccine at a reduced price immediately prior to the commencement of the influenza vaccine shortage period, the price at which the person usually offers influenza vaccine shall be used as the benchmark for these purposes;</p><p>2. Whether the price charged by the person grossly exceeded the price at which influenza vaccine was readily obtainable by consumers in the trade area during the 10 days immediately prior to the commencement of the influenza vaccine shortage period; and</p><p>3. Whether the increase in the amount charged by the person was attributable solely to additional costs incurred by the person in connection with the sale of the influenza vaccine, including additional costs imposed by the person's source. Proof that the person incurred such additional costs during the time of the influenza vaccine shortage period shall be prima facie evidence that the price increase was not unconscionable.</p><p>2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0861'>861</a>.</p>
