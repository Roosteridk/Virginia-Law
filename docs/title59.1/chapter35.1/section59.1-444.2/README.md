# § 59.1-444.2 Security freezes.

<p>A. As used in this section, "security freeze" means a notice placed in a consumer's credit report, at the request of the consumer and subject to certain exceptions, that prohibits the consumer reporting agency from releasing the consumer's credit report or score relating to the extension of credit.</p><p>B. A consumer may request that a security freeze be placed on his or her credit report by sending a request in writing by certified mail, or such other secure method authorized by a consumer reporting agency, to a consumer reporting agency at an address designated by the consumer reporting agency to receive such requests. This subsection does not prevent a consumer reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer's credit report.</p><p>C. A consumer reporting agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report no later than three business days after receiving from the consumer:</p><p>1. A written request described in subsection B; and</p><p>2. Proper identification.</p><p>A consumer reporting agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report no later than one business day after receiving such a request, if such request is made electronically at an address designated by the consumer reporting agency to receive such requests.</p><p>D. The consumer reporting agency shall send a written confirmation of the placement of the security freeze to the consumer within 10 business days. Upon placing the security freeze on the consumer's credit report, the consumer reporting agency shall provide the consumer with a unique personal identification number or password, or similar device to be used by the consumer when providing authorization for the release of his credit report for a specific period of time or for a specific party.</p><p>E. If the consumer wishes to allow his credit report to be accessed for a specific period of time or for a specific party while a freeze is in place, he shall contact the consumer reporting agency using a point of contact designated by the consumer reporting agency, request that the freeze be temporarily lifted, and provide the following:</p><p>1. Proper identification;</p><p>2. The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to subsection D; and</p><p>3. The proper information regarding the time period or the specific party for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.</p><p>F. A consumer reporting agency:</p><p>1. Shall comply with a request made under subsection E:</p><p>a. Within three business days after receiving the request if the request is made at a postal address designated by the agency to receive such requests; or</p><p>b. Within 15 minutes after the consumer's request is received by the consumer reporting agency through the electronic contact method chosen by the consumer reporting agency in accordance with this section;</p><p>2. Is not required to temporarily lift a security freeze within the time provided in subdivision 1 b if:</p><p>a. The consumer fails to meet the requirements of subsection E; or</p><p>b. The consumer reporting agency's ability to temporarily lift the security freeze within 15 minutes is prevented by:</p><p>(1) An act of God, including fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, or similar natural disaster or phenomena;</p><p>(2) Unauthorized or illegal acts by a third party, including terrorism, sabotage, riot, vandalism, labor strikes or disputes disrupting operations, or similar occurrence;</p><p>(3) Operational interruption, including electrical failure, unanticipated delay in equipment or replacement part delivery, computer hardware or software failures inhibiting response time, or similar disruption;</p><p>(4) Governmental action, including emergency orders or regulations, judicial or law-enforcement action, or similar directives;</p><p>(5) Regularly scheduled maintenance, during other than normal business hours, of, or updates to, the consumer reporting agency's systems; or</p><p>(6) Commercially reasonable maintenance of, or repair to, the consumer reporting agency's systems that is unexpected or unscheduled; and</p><p>3. May develop procedures involving the use of telephone, fax, the Internet, or other electronic media to receive and process a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report pursuant to subsection E in an expedited manner.</p><p>G. A consumer reporting agency shall remove or temporarily lift a freeze placed on a consumer's credit report only in the following cases:</p><p>1. Upon a consumer request, pursuant to subsection E or subsection J; or</p><p>2. If the consumer's credit report was frozen due to a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer. If a consumer reporting agency intends to remove a freeze upon a consumer's credit report pursuant to this subdivision, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer in writing prior to removing the freeze on the consumer's credit report.</p><p>H. If a third party requests access to a consumer credit report on which a security freeze is in effect, and this request is in connection with an application for credit or any other use, and the consumer does not allow his or her credit report to be accessed for that period of time, the third party may treat the application as incomplete.</p><p>I. If a consumer requests a security freeze, the consumer reporting agency shall disclose the process of placing and temporarily lifting a freeze and the process for allowing access to information from the consumer's credit report for a period of time while the freeze is in place.</p><p>J. A security freeze shall remain in place until the consumer requests, using a point of contact designated by the consumer reporting agency, that the security freeze be removed. A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze within three business days of receiving a request for removal from the consumer, who provides:</p><p>1. Proper identification; and</p><p>2. The unique personal identification number or password or similar device provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to subsection D.</p><p>K. A consumer reporting agency shall require proper identification of the person making a request to place or remove a security freeze.</p><p>L. The provisions of this section do not apply to the use of a consumer credit report by any of the following:</p><p>1. A person or entity, or a subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of that person or entity, or an assignee of a financial obligation owing by the consumer to that person or entity, or a prospective assignee of a financial obligation owing by the consumer to that person or entity in conjunction with the proposed purchase of the financial obligation, with which the consumer has or had prior to assignment an account or contract, including a demand deposit account, or to whom the consumer issued a negotiable instrument, for the purposes of reviewing the account or collecting the financial obligation owing for the account, contract, or negotiable instrument.

In the case of an address change, the written confirmation shall be sent to both the new address and to the former address.</p><p>O. The following entities are not required to place a security freeze on a credit report:</p><p>1. A consumer reporting agency that acts only as a reseller of credit information by assembling and merging information contained in the database of another consumer reporting agency or multiple consumer credit reporting agencies, and does not maintain a permanent database of credit information from which new consumer credit reports are produced. However, a consumer reporting agency acting as a reseller shall honor any security freeze placed on a consumer credit report by another consumer reporting agency;</p><p>2.

A security freeze must be requested in writing by certified mail. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, Internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit at point of sale. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or authorize the release of your credit report for a period of time or for a specific party after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:</p><p>1. The personal identification number or password;</p><p>2. Proper identification to verify your identity; and</p><p>3. The proper information regarding the period of time or the specific party for which the report shall be available.</p><p>A consumer reporting agency must authorize the release of your credit report no later than three business days after receiving the above information. A consumer credit reporting agency must authorize the release of your credit report no later than 15 minutes after receiving the request.</p><p>A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account, that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.</p><p>You have a right to bring civil action against anyone, including a consumer reporting agency, who improperly obtains access to a file, knowingly or willfully misuses file data, or fails to correct inaccurate file data.</p><p>A consumer reporting agency does not have the right to charge you a fee to place a freeze on your credit report."</p><p>Q. Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this section or § <a href='/vacode/59.1-444.3/'>59.1-444.3</a> with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of:</p><p>1. Any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000;</p><p>2. Such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow; and</p><p>3. In the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.</p><p>R. Any person who obtains a consumer report, requests a security freeze, requests the temporary lift of a freeze, or requests the removal of a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or in an attempt to violate federal or state law shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or $1,000, whichever is greater.</p><p>S. Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this section with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of:</p><p>1. Any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and</p><p>2.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law:</p><p>1. The exclusive authority to bring an action for any violation of subdivision F 1 b shall be with the Attorney General. In any action brought under this subsection, the Attorney General may cause an action to be brought in the name of the Commonwealth to enjoin the violation and to recover damages for aggrieved consumers consistent with the limits stated in subsections Q and S for such violations.</p><p>2. In any action brought under this subsection, if the court finds a willful violation, the court may, in its discretion, also award a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per violation, to be deposited in the Literary Fund of the Commonwealth.</p><p>3.
