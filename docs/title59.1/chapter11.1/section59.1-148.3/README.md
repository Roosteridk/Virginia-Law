Determinations of fair market value may be made by reference to a recognized pricing guide.</p><p>C. The agencies listed in subsection A may allow the immediate survivor of any sworn law-enforcement officer (i) who is killed in the line of duty or (ii) who dies in service and has at least 10 years of service to purchase the service handgun issued to the officer by the agency at a price of $1.</p><p>D. The governing board of any institution of higher learning named in § <a href='/vacode/23.1-1100/'>23.1-1100</a> may allow any campus police officer appointed pursuant to Article 3 (§ <a href='/vacode/23.1-809/'>23.1-809</a> et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 23.1 who retires on or after July 1, 1991, to purchase the service handgun issued to him at a price equivalent to the weapon's fair market value on the date of the officer's retirement.
