Such civil penalty or penalties, costs, reasonable expenses, and attorney's fees shall be paid into the general fund of the Commonwealth or of the county, city, or town which such attorney represented.</p><p>D. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the power of the court to punish as contempt the violation of any order issued by the court, or as limiting the power of the court to enter other orders under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-203/'>59.1-203</a> or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-205/'>59.1-205</a>.</p><p>E.
