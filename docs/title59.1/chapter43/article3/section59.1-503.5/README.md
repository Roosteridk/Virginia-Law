# ยง 59.1-503.5 Terms to be specified.

<p>An agreement that is otherwise sufficiently definite to be a contract is not invalid because it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. If particulars of performance are to be specified by a party, the following rules apply:</p><p>(1) Specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.</p><p>(2) If a specification materially affects the other party's performance but is not seasonably made, the other party:</p><p>(A) is excused for any resulting delay in its performance; and</p><p>(B) may perform, suspend performance, or treat the failure to specify as a breach of contract.</p><p>2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0101'>101</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0996'>996</a>.</p>
