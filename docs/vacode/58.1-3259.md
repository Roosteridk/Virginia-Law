# § 58.1-3259 Failure of county or city to comply with law on general reassessment of real estate.

If any county or city fails to comply with the provisions of this article requiring a general reassessment of real estate periodically in such county or city by omitting such general reassessment in the year required by this article, or by failing to comply with the provisions of § [58.1-3201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3201/) requiring assessment at 100 percent fair market value, the Department, on receiving proof of such delinquency, shall so notify the Comptroller, whereupon the Comptroller shall withhold from such county or city the payment of its share of the net profits of the operation of the alcoholic beverage control system as provided for by § [4.1-117](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/4.1-117/) until such time as the provisions of § [58.1-3201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3201/) have been complied with in such county or city. Results of the Tax Department's official assessment sales ratio study showing such county or city to have a sales assessment ratio lower than 70 percent or higher than 130 percent for the year a general reassessment or annual assessment is effective shall be prima facie proof that such locality has failed to assess at 100 percent.

The Department shall notify the Comptroller to pay over the accumulated profits, less a penalty charge of eight percent annually, on receipt of the results of an official assessment sales ratio study showing such county or city to have a sales assessment ratio higher than 70 percent and less than 130 percent.
