# § 62.1-229.4 Loans for stormwater runoff control best management practices.

Loans may be made from the Fund, in the Board's discretion, to a local government for the purpose of constructing facilities or structures or implementing other best management practices that reduce or prevent pollution of state waters caused by stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces. The Board shall develop guidelines for the administration of such loans and shall determine the terms and conditions of any loan from the Fund. Unless otherwise required by law, loans for such facilities, structures, and other best management practices may be made only when loan requests for eligible wastewater treatment facilities designed to meet the water quality standards established pursuant to § [62.1-44.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15/) have first been satisfied. The Board shall give priority (i) first to local governments that have adopted a stormwater control program in accordance with § [15.2-2114](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2114/), (ii) second to projects designed to reduce or prevent a pollutant in a water body where the water body is in violation of water quality standards established pursuant to § [62.1-44.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15/), (iii) third to local governments subject to an MS4 discharge permit issued by the Board in accordance with § [62.1-44.15:20](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:20/), (iv) fourth to local governments that have adopted a stormwater management program in accordance with the stormwater management provisions of the State Water Control Law (§ [62.1-44.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.2/) et seq.), and (v) fifth to all others.
