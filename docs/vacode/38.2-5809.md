# § 38.2-5809 Suspension or revocation of license.

The Commission may suspend or revoke any license issued to a health carrier if it finds that any of the following conditions exist:

1. The State Health Commissioner certifies to the Commission pursuant to § [32.1-137.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.5/) that the health carrier or its MCHIP is unable to fulfill its obligations to furnish quality health care services as set forth in Article 1.1 (§ [32.1-137.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.1/) et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 32.1. The suspension of a certificate of quality assurance shall not be deemed such a certification by the State Health Commissioner.

2. The State Health Commissioner notifies the Commission that the health carrier has failed to implement the complaint system required by Title 32.1 and § [38.2-5804](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-5804/) to resolve valid complaints reasonably.

3. The Commission determines that a certificate of quality assurance issued to the health carrier has been revoked by the State Health Commissioner, or a request for renewal of such certificate has been denied or disapproved by the State Health Commissioner.
