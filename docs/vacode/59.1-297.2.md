# ยง 59.1-297.2 Automatic termination of a health club contract.

A health club contract shall be considered terminated automatically if the designated facility closes permanently and the health club does not provide a comparable alternate facility. A facility closes temporarily if it closes for a reasonable period of time (i) for renovations to all or a portion of the facility, (ii) because the lease for the facility has been canceled, or (iii) because of a fire, or a flood or other act of God, or other cause not within the reasonable control of the health club. If a facility closes temporarily, it shall within 14 days from the time of the temporary closing provide notice of the date it expects to reopen, which date shall be within a reasonable period of time from the time the facility temporarily closes, to the Commissioner and shall conspicuously post such notice both within and outside each entrance to the facility.
