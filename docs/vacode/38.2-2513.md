# § 38.2-2513 Withdrawal and exclusion of members.

A. Any member of a mutual assessment property and casualty insurer may withdraw as a member at any time by giving at least thirty days' written notice to the insurer and paying his share of all losses against the insurer that have occurred prior to the member's withdrawal and which have not been fully reserved or for which surplus is inadequate. Upon this withdrawal the member shall be paid by the insurer any unearned premium, unearned fee or unearned assessment paid in advance.

B. Any member who neglects or refuses to pay an assessment or premium when due may be excluded from membership for that or any other reason satisfactory to a majority of the directors or the executive committee, or as the bylaws prescribe. The member shall remain liable for the payment of any assessments made for losses that have occurred prior to his exclusion, and also for the amounts provided for in § [38.2-2522](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2522/), if action is instituted within twelve months after the time the assessments become due.
