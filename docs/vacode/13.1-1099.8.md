# § 13.1-1099.8 Claim seeking to disregard limitation of liability.

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B, a claim seeking to disregard a limitation in § [13.1-1099.7](/vacode/13.1-1099.7/) is governed by the principles of law and equity, including a principle providing a right to a creditor or holding a person liable for a debt, obligation, or other liability of another person, that would apply if each protected series of a series limited liability company were a limited liability company formed separately from the series limited liability company and distinct from the series limited liability company and any other protected series of the series limited liability company.

B. The failure of a series limited liability company or a protected series to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not a ground to disregard a limitation in subsection A of § [13.1-1099.7](/vacode/13.1-1099.7/) but may be a ground to disregard a limitation in subsection B of § [13.1-1099.7](/vacode/13.1-1099.7/).

C. This section applies to a claim seeking to disregard a limitation of liability applicable to a foreign series limited liability company or foreign protected series and comparable to a limitation stated in § [13.1-1099.7](/vacode/13.1-1099.7/), if:

1. The claimant is a resident of the Commonwealth or transacting business or registered to transact business in the Commonwealth; or

2. The claim is to establish or enforce a liability arising under a law of the Commonwealth other than this chapter or from an act or omission in the Commonwealth.
