# ยง 36-47.2 Consolidation of two or more housing authorities within same city.

If the governing body of any city having two or more separate housing authorities created pursuant to this title shall, by resolution, declare it necessary and in the public interest to consolidate such authorities, or abolish the same and create a single or consolidated housing authority, then such new housing authority shall thereupon be created (with such corporate name as may be selected), and it shall exercise its public and corporate powers, and such other functions within such city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, including the power to undertake projects applicable to housing authorities created for cities or counties. The governing body of any such city shall have the authority to terminate any one or more of such authorities and continue any other single authority, as a consolidated authority in which case any terminated authority shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing the necessary documents for the transfer of its respective assets and liabilities, if any, to the new consolidated or surviving authority. If a new or consolidated authority is created, its membership shall be composed of seven commissioners, five of whom shall be the commissioners presently serving under existing law under any authority created within such city, and two of whom shall be commissioners selected from the other authority or the authority that is terminated. Each such commissioner shall continue to serve for the term for which he was appointed or until his successor has been appointed and has qualified.
