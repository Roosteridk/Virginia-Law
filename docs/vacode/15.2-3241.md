# ยง 15.2-3241 Petition for contraction of towns located in two or more counties; appointment of special court.

Whenever it is deemed desirable to contract the corporate limits of a town located partially in one county and partially in another, a majority of voters registered to vote at the preceding November general election residing in that part of the town which is proposed to be abandoned may petition the circuit court for the county in which that part of the town is located to amend the charter of the town so as to exclude from the corporate limits of the town that part of the town which is located in such county.

Such petition shall be signed by the petitioners. It shall accurately define the boundary of the territory proposed to be abandoned and shall pray that the charter of the town may be amended so as to exclude such territory from the corporate limits of the town. The circuit court with which the petition was filed shall notify the Supreme Court which shall appoint a special court to hear the case as prescribed by Chapter 30 (ยง [15.2-3000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3000/) et seq.) of this title.
