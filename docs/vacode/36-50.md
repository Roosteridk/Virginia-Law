# § 36-50 Extension of general powers for actions taken pursuant to a redevelopment plan.

In undertaking actions pursuant to a redevelopment plan, an authority shall have all the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities provided in this chapter. However, nothing contained in §§ [36-21](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-21/) and [36-22](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-22/) shall be construed as limiting the power of an authority, in the event of a default (including failure of compliance with a redevelopment plan) by a purchaser or lessee of land in a redevelopment plan, to acquire property and operate it free from the restrictions contained in §§ [36-21](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-21/) and [36-22](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-22/); and provided further, that any property which an authority leases to nongovernmental persons or entities for redevelopment under a redevelopment plan shall have the same tax status as if such leased property were owned by such nongovernmental persons or entities.
