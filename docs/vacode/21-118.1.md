# ยง 21-118.1 Authority to acquire property from United States or any agency thereof.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the governing body of any sanitary district may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the acquisition and purchase from the United States, or any agency thereof, whether now existing or hereafter created, of any equipment, supplies, materials, or other property, real or personal, in such manner as such governing body may determine.

It is the purpose of this section to enable sanitary districts to secure from time to time promptly the benefits of acquisitions and purchases as authorized by this section, to aid them in securing advantageous purchases, to prevent unemployment and thereby to assist in promotion of public welfare and to these ends such districts shall have power to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out such purpose, in addition to the expressed power conferred by this section. This section is remedial in nature and the powers hereby granted shall be liberally construed.
