# § 38.2-3208 Same; industrial policies.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date as defined in § [38.2-3209](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3209/). For industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of § [38.2-3216](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3216/), all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in §§ [38.2-3202](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3202/) through [38.2-3205](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3205/) shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. However, the rate of interest shall not exceed (i) 3 1/2 percent per year for policies issued before July 1, 1975, (ii) four percent per year for policies issued on or after July 1, 1975, and prior to July 1, 1979, and (iii) 5 1/2 percent per year for policies issued on or after July 1, 1979. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the rate of interest for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy issued on or after July 1, 1979, may be a rate not exceeding 6 1/2 percent per year. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with any accompanying pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on any other table of mortality specified by the insurer and approved by the Commission.
