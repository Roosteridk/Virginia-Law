The authority shall fix and revise from time to time the rents, fees and other charges to be paid to it in connection with the lease or sale of various authority facilities and for any other services furnished or provided by the authority. Such rents, fees and charges shall provide at least sufficient funds to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating such projects and the principal and interest of any bonds issued by the authority or other debts contracted as the bonds become due and payable. The authority and the political subdivision in which all or any part of a particular authority facility is located may agree on payment by the authority on account of governmental services to be rendered by the political subdivision in such amounts as the authority may find to be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. A reserve may be accumulated and maintained out of the revenues and receipts of the authority for extraordinary repairs and expenses and for such other purposes as may be provided in any resolution authorizing a bond issue or in any trust indenture securing the authority's bonds. Subject to such provisions and restrictions as may be set forth in the resolution or in the trust indenture authorizing or securing any of the bonds or other obligations hereunder, the authority shall have exclusive control of the revenues and receipts derived from the lease or sale of any authority facility and the right to use the revenues and receipts in the exercise of its powers and duties set forth in this chapter.
