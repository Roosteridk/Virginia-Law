# § 38.2-217 When assets may not be distributed among stockholders.

No domestic insurer shall distribute its assets among its stockholders until all risks have expired or have been cancelled, or have been replaced by the policies of another solvent insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth, and until all claims against the insurer have been settled. No insurer shall contract to reinsure its risks for the purpose of distributing its assets without first obtaining the written approval of the Commission. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the lawful payment of dividends.
