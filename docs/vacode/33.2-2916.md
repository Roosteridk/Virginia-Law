If the City of Richmond has rendered financial assistance or contributed in any manner to the cost of construction of a limited access highway by the Authority within or partly within and partly without the corporate limits of the City of Richmond, and the Authority has issued bonds for the construction of such limited access highway, then, when all such bonds, including refunding bonds, and the interest thereon have been paid or a sufficient amount of cash or United States government securities have been deposited and dedicated to the payment of all such bonds and the interest to the maturity or redemption date thereof in trust for the benefit of the holders of such bonds, all property, real and personal, acquired in connection with such limited access highway within the City of Richmond shall be transferred by the Authority to the City as compensation to the City for the financial assistance rendered by the City to the Authority in connection with the construction or acquisition of such limited access highway. Such highway shall upon the acceptance thereof by the City become a part of the street or highway system of the City and shall thereafter be maintained and operated as a limited access highway by the City. The governing body of the City of Richmond shall have the power to fix, revise, charge, and collect tolls for transit over such limited access highway and as compensation for other uses that may be made thereof. The proceeds from such tolls and compensation shall be first used to reimburse the City of Richmond and the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield for any funds or expenditures made by each of them pursuant to contracts or agreements authorized by ยง [33.2-2913](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-2913/) for which reimbursement has not been made, and then for the operation, maintenance, improvement, expansion, or extension of such limited access highway and to increase its utility and benefits and for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and operation of other projects or highways connected with such limited access highway or with the federal or state highway systems, and for such purpose the City of Richmond shall succeed to all the functions and shall have all the powers conferred on the Authority by this chapter.

If such property is accepted by the political subdivision where the property is located, the governing body of such subdivision shall have the power to fix, revise, charge, and collect tolls for transit over such limited access highway project or extension and as compensation for other uses that may be made thereof. The proceeds from such tolls and compensation shall be used first to reimburse the City of Richmond and the Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield for any funds or expenditures made by each of them pursuant to contracts or agreements authorized by ยง [33.2-2913](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-2913/) for which reimbursement has not been made and then for the operation, maintenance, improvement, expansion, or extension of such limited access highway project and to increase its utility and benefits and for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and operation of other projects or highways connected with such limited access highway or with the state or federal highway systems and for such purpose such political subdivisions shall succeed to all the functions and shall have all the powers conferred on the Authority by this chapter with respect to such property.
