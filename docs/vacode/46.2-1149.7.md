# ยง 46.2-1149.7 Specialized construction equipment; permits; engineering analysis; costs.

A. For the purpose of this section, "specialized construction equipment" means (i) rubber-tracked, or tracked when protective matting is used, self-propelled equipment being used in highway maintenance and construction projects and (ii) tracked, self-propelled equipment being used in emergency operations, including snow removal.

B. The Commissioner of Highways, upon written application made by the owner or operator of specialized construction equipment, may issue a single trip or multi-trip permit allowing such equipment to be driven across structures maintained by the Department of Transportation within, or to gain access to, a highway construction or maintenance work zone of the Department of Transportation, as defined in the most recent version of the Department of Transportation's Virginia Work Area Protection Manual, or to access any road or structure maintained by the Department of Transportation when needed by the Department for snow removal or other emergency operations. The permits shall be issued only after an engineering analysis of a proposed routing has been conducted by the Department of Transportation to assess the ability of the roads and structures to be traversed to sustain the equipment's size and weight. Such permit shall designate the route to be traversed and contain restrictions or conditions regarding the specialized construction equipment's operation across structures. The fee for a permit issued under this section shall be based on the costs assessed against the applicant to cover engineering analysis, not to exceed three hours.
