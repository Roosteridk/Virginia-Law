# § 25.1-414 Authority of state agency where replacement housing not available; requiring person to move.

A. If a program or project undertaken by a state agency cannot proceed to actual construction on a timely basis because comparable replacement dwellings are not available, and the state agency determines that such dwellings cannot otherwise be made available, the state agency may take such action as is necessary or appropriate to provide such dwellings by use of funds authorized for such project. The state agency may use this section to exceed the maximum amounts that may be paid under §§ [25.1-409](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-409/) and [25.1-410](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-410/) on a case-by-case basis for good cause as determined in accordance with such regulations as the state agency shall issue.

B. No person shall be required to move from his dwelling on account of any project, unless the head of the state agency is satisfied that comparable replacement housing is available to such person.
