# § 63.2-1923 Immediate withholding from income; exception; notices required.

A. Every administrative support order directing a noncustodial parent to pay child or child and spousal support shall provide for immediate income withholding from the noncustodial parent's income as defined in § [63.2-1900](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1900/) of an amount for current support plus an amount to be applied toward liquidation of arrearages, if any, unless the obligor and the Department, on behalf of the obligee, agree to a written alternative payment arrangement, or good cause is shown. Good cause shall be based upon a written determination that, and explanation by the Department of why, implementing immediate withholding would not be in the best interests of the child. The total amount withheld shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted under § [34-29](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/).

B. The order shall include, but not be limited to, notice (i) of the amount that will be withheld, (ii) that the withholding applies to any current or subsequent period of employment, (iii) of the right to contest whether a duty of support is owed and the information specified in the administrative order is correct, (iv) that a written request to appeal the withholding shall be made to the Department within 10 days of receipt of the notice, and (v) of the actions that will be taken by the Department if an appeal is noted, which shall include the opportunity to present his objections to the administrative hearing officer at a hearing held pursuant to § [63.2-1942](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1942/). Upon service of the order on the employer by first-class or certified mail, by electronic means, or by service in accordance with the provisions of § [8.01-296](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-296/), [8.01-327](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-327/) or [8.01-329](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-329/), the employer shall deliver the order to the noncustodial parent.

C. The noncustodial parent's employer shall be issued by first-class or certified mail or by electronic means, including facsimile transmission, an administrative order for withholding of income which shall conform to § [20-79.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/). The rights and responsibilities of an employer with respect to such orders are set out in § [20-79.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/).

D. Administrative orders for withholding from income shall be promptly terminated or modified by the Department when (i) the obligation to support has been satisfied and arrearages have been paid, (ii) the whereabouts of the child or child and custodial parent become unknown, or (iii) modification is appropriate because of a change in the amount of the obligation.
