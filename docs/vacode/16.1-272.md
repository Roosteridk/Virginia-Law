# § 16.1-272 Power of circuit court over juvenile offender.

A. In any case in which a juvenile is indicted, the offense for which he is indicted and all ancillary charges shall be tried in the same manner as provided for in the trial of adults, except as otherwise provided with regard to sentencing. Upon a finding of guilty of any charge, the court shall fix the sentence without the intervention of a jury. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a court to review the results of an investigation completed pursuant to § [16.1-273](/vacode/16.1-273/).

1. If a juvenile is convicted of a violent juvenile felony, for that offense and for all ancillary crimes the court may order that (i) the juvenile serve a portion of the sentence as a serious juvenile offender under § [16.1-285.1](/vacode/16.1-285.1/) and the remainder of such sentence in the same manner as provided for adults; (ii) the juvenile serve the entire sentence in the same manner as provided for adults; or (iii) the portion of the sentence to be served in the same manner as provided for adults be suspended conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case including, but not limited to, commitment under subdivision A 14 of § [16.1-278.8](/vacode/16.1-278.8/) or § [16.1-285.1](/vacode/16.1-285.1/).

2. If the juvenile is convicted of any other felony, the court may sentence or commit the juvenile offender in accordance with the criminal laws of this Commonwealth or may in its discretion deal with the juvenile in the manner prescribed in this chapter for the hearing and disposition of cases in the juvenile court, including, but not limited to, commitment under § [16.1-285.1](/vacode/16.1-285.1/) or may in its discretion impose an adult sentence and suspend the sentence conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case.

3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the juvenile is convicted of any felony, the court may in its discretion depart from any mandatory minimum sentence required by law or suspend any portion of an otherwise applicable sentence.

4. If the juvenile is not convicted of a felony but is convicted of a misdemeanor, the court shall deal with the juvenile in the manner prescribed by law for the disposition of a delinquency case in the juvenile court.

B. If the circuit court decides to deal with the juvenile in the same manner as a case in the juvenile court and places the juvenile on probation, the juvenile may be supervised by a juvenile probation officer.

C. Whether the court sentences and commits the juvenile as a juvenile under this chapter or under the criminal law, in cases where the juvenile is convicted of a felony in violation of § [18.2-61](/vacode/18.2-61/), [18.2-63](/vacode/18.2-63/), [18.2-64.1](/vacode/18.2-64.1/), [18.2-67.1](/vacode/18.2-67.1/), [18.2-67.2](/vacode/18.2-67.2/), [18.2-67.3](/vacode/18.2-67.3/), [18.2-67.5](/vacode/18.2-67.5/), [18.2-370](/vacode/18.2-370/) or [18.2-370.1](/vacode/18.2-370.1/) or, where the victim is a minor or is physically helpless or mentally incapacitated as defined in § [18.2-67.10](/vacode/18.2-67.10/), subsection B of § [18.2-361](/vacode/18.2-361/) or subsection B of § [18.2-366](/vacode/18.2-366/), the clerk shall make the report required by § [19.2-390](/vacode/19.2-390/) to the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry established pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ [9.1-900](/vacode/9.1-900/) et seq.) of Title 9.1.

D. In any case in which a juvenile is not sentenced as a juvenile under this chapter, the court shall, in addition to considering any other factor and prior to imposing a sentence, consider (i) the juvenile's exposure to adverse childhood experiences, early childhood trauma, or any child welfare agency and (ii) the differences between juvenile and adult offenders.

E. A juvenile sentenced pursuant to clause (i) of subdivision A 1 shall be eligible to earn sentence credits in the manner prescribed by § [53.1-202.2](/vacode/53.1-202.2/) for the portion of the sentence served as a serious juvenile offender under § [16.1-285.1](/vacode/16.1-285.1/).

F. If the court sentences the juvenile as a juvenile under this chapter, the clerk shall provide a copy of the court's final order or judgment to the court service unit in the same locality as the juvenile court to which the case had been transferred.
