# ยง 15.2-2108.32 Application of article to certain localities.

In any locality in which the governing body of the locality has granted one or more new cable franchises during the 12-month period prior to July 1, 2006, that include an overlapping geographic service area with another cable franchise within that locality, all franchises within that locality shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest expiration date of the overlapping franchises or until one is terminated pursuant to the terms of the franchise and shall not be subject to the provisions of this article, except as set forth in this section. A locality that has granted one or more new, overlapping franchises within the 12-month period prior to July 1, 2006, shall have the option not to offer, accept, or implement the ordinance cable franchise process described in ยง [15.2-2108.22](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2108.22/) until the earliest expiration date of the overlapping franchises, but may determine only to grant new cable franchises during such period through the negotiated cable franchise process. Any such locality, when granting any additional cable franchises after July 1, 2006, and until the existing cable franchises expire or are terminated pursuant to their terms, shall make the terms of any such newly granted franchise available, pursuant to ยง [15.2-2108.26](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2108.26/), to all cable operators with existing franchises. Any locality in which the governing body of the locality has granted one or more new cable franchises during the 12-month period prior to July 1, 2006, that include an overlapping geographic service area with another cable franchise within that locality, shall make the terms of any such newly granted franchise available, in the manner described in ยง [15.2-2108.26](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2108.26/), to all cable operators with existing franchises on the date the subsequent overlapping franchise was awarded. Upon the expiration of a current cable franchise that is subject to this section, the provisions of this section shall no longer be applicable to any cable franchise in such locality and the locality shall thereafter be subject to all provisions of this article.
