# ยง 51.1-1108 Use of family and personal leave.

A. Participating employees shall be eligible to take family and personal leave to account for absences due to a short-term incident, illness or death of a family member, or other personal need. Participating employees shall be compensated by their employers at 100 percent of creditable compensation for each hour of family and personal leave taken, not to exceed the employee's family and personal leave balance.

B. Family and personal leave may be taken for any permitted purpose at the sole discretion of the participating employee, provided that the employee gives reasonable prior notice to his immediate supervisor and the immediate supervisor does not inform the employee that his taking the leave will materially impede the ability of the employing agency to perform a critical function due to an emergency or exigent circumstances.
