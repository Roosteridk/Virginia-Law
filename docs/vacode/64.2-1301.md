# § 64.2-1301 When inventory and settlement not required.

An inventory under § [64.2-1300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1300/) or a settlement under § [64.2-1206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1206/) shall not be required of a personal representative who qualifies for the sole purpose of bringing an action under § [8.01-50](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-50/). However, if there is no surviving relative designated as a beneficiary under § [8.01-53](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-53/) and the circuit court directs that the funds recovered in such action be paid to the personal representative for distribution according to law, the personal representative shall file the inventory required in § [64.2-1300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1300/) and the statement required under § [64.2-1206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1206/).
