In addition to all other taxes and fees permitted by law, (i) the governing body of any locality embraced by the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority may, by ordinance, annually impose on all real property in the locality specially classified in subsection A: an amount of real property tax, in addition to such amount otherwise authorized by law, at a rate not to exceed $0.125 per $100 of assessed value as the governing body may, by ordinance, impose upon the annual assessed value of all real property used for or zoned to permit commercial or industrial uses; and (ii) the governing body of any locality wholly embraced by the Hampton Roads metropolitan planning area as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to § 134 of Title 23 of the United States Code may, by ordinance, annually impose on all real property in the locality specially classified in subsection A: an amount of real property tax, in addition to such amount otherwise authorized by law, at a rate not to exceed $0.10 per $100 of assessed value as the governing body may, by ordinance, impose upon the annual assessed value of all real property used for or zoned to permit commercial or industrial uses. The authority granted in this subsection shall be subject to the following conditions:

Beginning January 1, 2008, in lieu of the authority set forth in subsections A and B above and solely for the purposes of imposing the tax authorized pursuant to this section, in the counties and cities wholly embraced by the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority and the Hampton Roads metropolitan planning area as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to § 134 of Title 23 of the United States Code, all real property used for or zoned to permit commercial or industrial uses is hereby declared to be a separate class of real property for local taxation. Such classification of real property shall exclude all residential uses and all multifamily residential uses, including but not limited to single family residential units, cooperatives, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, or homes in a subdivision when leased on a unit by unit basis even though these units may be part of a larger building or parcel of real estate containing more than four residential units.

D. In addition to all other taxes and fees permitted by law, (i) the governing body of any locality embraced by the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority may, by ordinance, create within its boundaries, one or more special regional transportation tax districts and, thereafter, may, by ordinance, impose upon the real property located in special regional transportation tax districts specially classified in subsection C within such special regional transportation tax districts: an amount of real property tax, in addition to such amounts otherwise authorized by law, at a rate not to exceed $0.125 per $100 of assessed value as the governing body may, by ordinance, impose upon the annual assessed value of all real property used for or zoned to permit commercial or industrial uses; and, (ii) the governing body of any locality wholly embraced by the Hampton Roads metropolitan planning area as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to § 134 of Title 23 of the United States Code may, by ordinance, create within its boundaries, one or more special regional transportation tax districts and, thereafter, may, by ordinance, impose upon the real property specially classified in subsection C within such special regional transportation tax districts: an amount of real property tax, in addition to such amounts otherwise authorized by law, at a rate not to exceed $0.10 per $100 of assessed value as the governing body may, by ordinance, impose upon the annual assessed value of all real property used for or zoned to permit commercial or industrial uses.
