# § 46.2-1144 Overweight permits for solid waste haulers.

The Commissioner, upon written application by the owner or operator of vehicles used exclusively for hauling solid waste other than hazardous waste, shall issue a permit authorizing the operation on the highway of such vehicles at gross weights in excess of those set forth in § [46.2-1126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1126/).

No permit issued under this section shall authorize a single axle weight of more than 20,000 pounds or a tandem axle weight of more than 40,000 pounds. No such permit shall be issued for a total gross weight in excess of 40,000 pounds for a two-axle vehicle, or of more than 60,000 pounds for a three-axle vehicle. Such permit shall be obtained annually at the time the vehicle is registered. The Commissioner may promulgate regulations governing such permits.

No such permit shall authorize the operation of any vehicle enumerated in this section beyond the boundary of the county or city where it is principally garaged or for a distance of more than 25 miles from the place where it is principally garaged, whichever is greater. However, the permit shall not designate the route to be traversed nor contain restrictions or conditions not applicable to other vehicles in their general use of the highways. Each vehicle, when loaded according to the provisions of a permit issued under this section, shall be operated at a reduced speed of 10 miles per hour slower than the legal speed limit in 55, 45, and 35 miles per hour speed limit zones.

The fee for a permit issued under this section shall be as provided in § [46.2-1140.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1140.1/).

For the purposes of this section, the terms "solid waste" and "hazardous waste" shall have the meanings provided in § [10.1-1400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1400/).
