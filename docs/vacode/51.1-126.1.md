# ยง 51.1-126.1 Certain employees of teaching hospitals.

A. Any teaching hospital affiliated with an institution of higher education, other than the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System Authority or the University of Virginia Medical Center, may establish a retirement plan covering in whole or in part its employees who are health care providers, as determined by the Department of Human Resource Management pursuant to ยง [2.2-2905](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2905/), and is authorized to make contributions for the benefit of its employees who elect to participate in such plan or arrangement rather than in the retirement system established by this chapter. Any such alternative retirement plan shall not become effective until July 1, 1991, or any time thereafter, as determined by such teaching hospital. Any health care provider employed by such teaching hospital on or after July 1, 1991, may make an irrevocable election to participate in either the retirement plan established by this chapter or the plan provided by the teaching hospital, in accordance with guidelines established by the Virginia Retirement System. The election herein provided shall, as to any health care provider employed after the alternative retirement plan implementation date, be exercised not later than thirty-one days from the time of entry upon the performance of his duties.

B. No health care provider employed by a teaching hospital who is an active member of a plan established under this section shall also be an active member of the retirement system or a beneficiary other than a contingent annuitant.

C. The contribution by the Commonwealth to any other retirement plan established on behalf of health care providers as provided in subsection A shall be the contribution by the Commonwealth which would be required if the health care provider were a member of the retirement system or eight percent of creditable compensation, whichever is less.

D. If the institution of higher education with which the teaching hospital is affiliated has adopted a retirement plan under ยง [51.1-126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126/) for its employees who are engaged in the performance of teaching, administrative, or research duties, the plan established under this section shall offer the same investment opportunities as are available to the participants of the plan established under ยง [51.1-126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126/).

E. The Virginia Retirement System shall develop policies and procedures for the administration of the retirement plan established under this section.
