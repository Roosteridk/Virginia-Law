"Express unitrust" means a trust for which, under the terms of the trust without regard to this article, income or net income must or may be calculated as a unitrust amount.

"Income trust" means a trust that is not a unitrust.

"Net fair market value of a trust" means the fair market value of the assets of the trust, less the noncontingent liabilities of the trust.

"Unitrust" means a trust for which net income is a unitrust amount. "Unitrust" includes an express unitrust.
