# ยง 15.2-3214 Costs.

The costs in annexation proceedings shall be paid by the locality instituting the proceedings and shall be the same as in other civil cases; however, in proceedings instituted by a town, in assessing the costs, the special court shall consider the extent to which county revenues are derived from within the town, the relative financial abilities of the parties and the relative merits of the case. The costs shall include the per diem and expenses of the court reporter, if any, and, in the discretion of the court, a reasonable allowance to the court for secretarial services in connection with the preparation of the written opinion. If the proceedings are instituted otherwise than by a city, town or county, such costs shall be paid as the court directs considering the relative merits of the case.

On appeal, the appellate court shall determine by whom the appellate costs shall be paid.
