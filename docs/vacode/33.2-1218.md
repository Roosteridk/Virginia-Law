# ยง 33.2-1218 Removal of billboard signs under this chapter prohibited without just compensation.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no billboard sign subject to this chapter may be removed by action of a county, city, or town under Chapter 22 (ยง [15.2-2200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2200/) et seq.) of Title 15.2 without the payment of just compensation by the county, city, or town unless the billboard sign cannot remain on the property due to the site constraints of the property and removal of the billboard sign is therefore necessary for development on the property. The property owner may terminate the leasehold or other right of the billboard sign to remain on the property in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract between the property owner and the billboard sign owner, but may not be required to do so by the county, city, or town as a condition of obtaining development approval for the property unless removal of the billboard sign is necessary for development of the property or the billboard sign is nonconforming and is the principal use on the property and the zoning ordinance permits only one principal use on the property.
