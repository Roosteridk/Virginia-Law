# ยง 54.1-3806.1 Disclosure forms required.

Any animal medical care facility in the Commonwealth, excluding those facilities dealing with livestock, as defined in ยง [3.2-5900](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-5900/), which does not provide continuous medical care for all animals left in its charge shall, before taking charge of an animal, provide the client or agent thereof with a disclosure form which specifies the hours and days when continuous medical care is not available at the facility. Such form shall be separate and apart from any other form or information provided by the facility. Except in emergency situations when time or circumstances do not permit, such facilities may take charge of an animal only after the client or agent thereof has signed the disclosure form and returned it to the facility. Only one signed form per client shall be required, and the form shall be kept on file by the facility.
