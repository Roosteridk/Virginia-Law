# ยง 58.1-1616 Absconding taxpayer.

If the Department finds that a person liable for tax under any provision of this chapter designs quickly to depart from the Commonwealth or to remove his property therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect such tax unless such proceeding be brought without delay, the Department shall cause notice of such finding to be given such person together with a demand for an immediate return and immediate payment of such tax. Thereupon such tax shall become immediately due and payable. If such person is not in default of making such return or paying any tax prescribed by this chapter, and furnishes evidence satisfactory to the Department in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Department, that he will duly return and pay the tax to which the Department's findings relate, then such tax shall not be payable prior to the time otherwise fixed for payment.
