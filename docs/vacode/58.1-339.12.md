"Qualified capital expenditures" means all expenditures made by the taxpayer for the purchase and installation of barrels, bins, bottling equipment, capsuling equipment, chemicals, corkers, crushers and destemmers, dirt, fermenters, or other recognized fermentation devices, fertilizer and soil amendments, filters, grape harvesters, grape plants, hoses, irrigation equipment, labeling equipment, poles, posts, presses, pumps, refractometers, refrigeration equipment, seeders, tanks, tractors, vats, weeding and spraying equipment, wine tanks, and wire.

"Virginia vineyard" means agricultural lands located in the Commonwealth consisting of at least one contiguous acre dedicated to the growing of grapes that are used or are intended to be used in the production of wine by a Virginia farm winery as well as any plants or other improvements located thereon.

"Virginia farm winery" means an establishment located in the Commonwealth that is licensed as a Virginia farm winery pursuant to § [4.1-206.1](/vacode/4.1-206.1/).

B. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2011, any Virginia farm winery or vineyard shall be entitled to a credit against the tax levied pursuant to §§ [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) and [58.1-400](/vacode/58.1-400/) for qualified capital expenditures made in connection with the establishment of new Virginia farm wineries or vineyards and capital improvements made to existing Virginia farm wineries or vineyards.

E. For purposes of this section, the amount of any credit attributable to a partnership, electing small business corporation (S corporation), or limited liability company shall be allocated to the individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.
