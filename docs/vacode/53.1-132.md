# ยง 53.1-132 Furloughs from local work release programs; penalty for violations.

The director of any work release program authorized by ยง [53.1-131](/vacode/53.1-131/) may, subject to rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, extend the limits of confinement of any offender participating in a work release program that is subject to the director's authority to permit the offender a furlough for the purpose of visiting his home or family. If such offender is participating in a work release program under the supervision of the administrator of a regional jail and the furlough would extend the limits of confinement of the offender to a locality not served by that regional jail, then notice of the furlough shall be provided to the sheriff of such locality. Such furlough shall be for a period to be prescribed by the director, not to exceed three days. The time during which an offender is on furlough shall not be counted as time served against any sentence, and during any furlough, no earned sentence credit as defined in ยง [53.1-116](/vacode/53.1-116/), good conduct allowance or credits, or any other reduction of sentence shall accrue.

Any offender who, without proper authority or without just cause, fails to remain within the limits of confinement set by the director hereunder, or fails to return within the time prescribed to the place designated by the director in granting such authority, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. An offender who is found guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor in accordance with this section shall be ineligible for further participation in a work release program during his current term of confinement.
