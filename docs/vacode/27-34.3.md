# ยง 27-34.3 Power to order immediate compliance with law, etc., or prohibit use of building or equipment.

The local fire marshal shall, if authorized by the governing body of the county, city or town appointing him, have the authority to exercise the powers authorized by the Fire Prevention Code. However, an order prohibiting the use of a building or equipment issued pursuant to this section shall not be effective beyond the date of a determination made by the authorities identified in and pursuant to ยง [27-97](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/27-97/), regardless of whether or not said determination overrules, modifies or affirms the order of the local fire marshal. If an order of the local fire marshal issued pursuant to this section conflicts to any degree with an order previously issued by an authority identified in and pursuant to ยง [27-97](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/27-97/), the latter order shall prevail. The local fire marshal shall immediately report to the authorities identified in ยง [27-97](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/27-97/) on the issuance and content of any order issued pursuant to this section.
