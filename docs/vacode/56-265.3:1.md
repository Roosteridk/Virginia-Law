# § 56-265.3:1 Certificates to furnish water and sewer service.

A. Any company proposing to construct facilities after January 1, 1995, ultimately intended to make water or sewer service available to more than fifty residential building lots shall, prior to construction or financial commitments therefor, organize a public service corporation and seek certificates of public convenience and necessity pursuant to §§ [56-265.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-265.2/) and [56-265.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-265.3/). The application for such certificates shall include (i) a comprehensive business plan detailing the technical, managerial and financial resources to be devoted to operation of the water or sewer service; (ii) except in the case of a company seeking a certificate to operate a sewer service only, proof of receipt of, or application for, a permit for the facilities pursuant to Virginia Department of Health requirements under Article 2 (§ [32.1-167](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-167/) et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 32.1; and (iii) such other information as is now or hereafter deemed appropriate by the Commission, including proof of the issuance of a bond or the deposit of funds in escrow as may be required by the Department of Health pursuant to § [32.1-174.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-174.1/).

B. Certificates of public convenience and necessity shall not be granted by the Commission unless, in addition to the findings required by §§ [56-265.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-265.2/) and [56-265.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-265.3/), it also finds that the comprehensive business plan presented in the application reasonably assures that system performance requirements for providing water supply can be met over the long term and at reasonable costs. The Commission may issue such certification with any conditions or restrictions as public interest may require.

C. Water or sewer companies existing on or before January 1, 1995 which extend their service at any time following the effective date of this section shall not be required to comply with the requirements thereof.

D. If any applicant under this section so requests, the Commission shall not disclose the contents of the comprehensive business plan except as necessary to perform its duties.
