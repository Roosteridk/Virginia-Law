# ยง 8.7-602 Attachment of goods covered by a negotiable document.

Except where the document was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person who had no power to dispose of them, no lien attaches by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document is outstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee or its negotiation is enjoined. The bailee shall not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to him or the court. One who purchases the document for value without notice of the process or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.
