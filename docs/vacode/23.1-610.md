Grants provided under this section shall be subject to limitation based on the amount of funds appropriated for such purpose. If applications for grants exceed the amount of funding appropriated, the Department of Military Affairs (the Department) shall issue grants to eligible recipients based on the order in which applications were received.

B. Application for a grant shall be made to the Department of Military Affairs (the Department) no later than 30 days prior to the beginning of an academic semester. The Department shall determine whether an applicant is eligible for the grant as described in subsection A and communicate acceptance and any additional requirements determined by the Department in writing no later than 30 days after receipt of an application. Applicants eligible for a grant pursuant to this section shall:

 1. Satisfy all financial obligations with the institution of higher education at the beginning of each semester; and 

 2. Provide written proof of acceptable academic performance and good standing with the institution of higher education for the current term to the Department no later than 30 days following the end of a term or semester. Upon the receipt of proof of academic performance and continued good standing to the Department, the Department shall issue grants in a manner and amount that is consistent with regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General. As used in this subdivision, "academic performance" means (i) achieving a passing grade in each course during the semester and (ii) maintaining a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 on a scale of 4.0 or its equivalent, and "good standing" means that the individual has fulfilled all obligations to the institution of higher education. 

 C. Any member of the Virginia National Guard receiving grants under this section shall incur a single two-year service obligation to the Virginia National Guard. The two-year obligation shall commence on the last day of the last term or semester for which tuition assistance was awarded. Service in the inactive National Guard, the active duty or reserve forces of the United States, or the National Guard of any other state shall not count as applicable service toward fulfilling this incurred service obligation. Federal active duty mobilizations occurring while still a member of the Virginia National Guard and state active duty for the Commonwealth shall count toward the two-year service obligation. 

 D. The Department may utilize grant funding in order to recruit qualified applicants for service in the Virginia National Guard. The yearly funding amount for such recruitment shall be at the discretion of the Adjutant General and the Department and not exceed $50,000 per fiscal year.
