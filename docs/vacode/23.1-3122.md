# § 23.1-3122 Powers of the board.

A. The board has, in addition to its other powers, all the corporate powers given to corporations by the provisions of Title 13.1, except in those cases where, by the express terms of its provisions, it is confined to corporations created under that title.

B. The board may accept, execute, and administer any trust in which it may have an interest under the terms of the instrument creating the trust.

C. The board may establish and administer agreements with public institutions of higher education and private institutions of higher education for the provision of associate, undergraduate, and graduate degree instructional programs at the Center. The board shall seek opportunities to collaborate with local comprehensive community colleges to meet specialized noncredit workforce training needs identified by industry. However, if local community colleges are unable to meet identified industry needs, then the board may seek to collaborate with other education providers or may provide Center-delivered specialized noncredit workforce training independent of local comprehensive community colleges.

D. The board, on behalf of the Center, may apply for, accept, and expend gifts, grants, or donations from public or private sources to enable it to carry out its purposes.
