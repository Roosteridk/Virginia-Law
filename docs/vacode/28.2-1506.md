# ยง 28.2-1506 Filing of initial inventories; amended or supplemental inventories.

Whenever any privately owned land in any of such counties is to be transferred, and the transferor or the transferee requests clarification as to whether any portion of such land is claimed by the Commonwealth as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, the Commission shall review the matter, and, if it determines that all or any portion of such land constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, the Commission shall file an amended or supplemental inventory as it may deem appropriate. Any such amended or supplemental inventory shall be filed in the same offices as the initial inventory for such area. The Commission shall not prepare or file any such amended or supplemental inventory unless (1) such classification is requested by a transferor or transferee as provided herein, or (2) (a) the federal government has asserted title to any ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands excluding the Wallops Island Naval/Aegis facility and all land adjacent thereto lying to the south that is used for a federal National Wildlife Refuge, (b) both the Governor and Attorney General concur in writing that all or any of the property to which the federal government has asserted title constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, and (c) such amended or supplemental inventory only asserts the Commonwealth's title to the portion of such property that constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands as concurred in by the Governor and the Attorney General.
