Accounts shall be kept for each item of appropriation made by the board. Each such account shall show in detail the appropriations made thereto, the amount drawn thereon, the unpaid obligation charged against it, and the unencumbered balance in the appropriation account, properly chargeable, sufficient to meet the obligation entailed by contract, agreement, or order.
