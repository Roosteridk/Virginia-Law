A. In order to protect the privacy and security of health professionals, the posting of addresses to the on-line licensure lookup or any successor in interest thereof shall only disclose the city or county provided to the Department and shall not include any street, rural delivery route, or post office address. However, the street address of facilities regulated by the Boards of Funeral Directors and Embalmers, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine shall be posted.

B. The Department shall collect an official address of record from each health professional licensed, registered, or certified by a health regulatory board within the Department, to be used by the Department and relevant health regulatory boards for agency purposes, including workforce planning and emergency contact pursuant to ยง [54.1-2506.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2506.1/).

C. In addition, the Department shall provide an opportunity for the health professional to provide a second address, for the purpose of public dissemination.

D. The Department shall develop a procedure for health professionals to update their address information at regular intervals, and may charge a fee sufficient to cover the costs for such updates.
