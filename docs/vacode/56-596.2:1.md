# § 56-596.2:1 Incentives for energy conservation measures and solar energy equipment.

A. Each Phase I and Phase II Utility, as such terms are defined in subdivision A 1 of § [56-585.1](/vacode/56-585.1/), shall submit a petition for approval to design, implement, and operate a three-year program of energy conservation measures providing incentives to low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals in an amount not to exceed $25 million in the aggregate for the installation of measures that reduce residential heating or cooling costs and enhance the health and safety of residents, including repairs and improvements to home heating or cooling systems and installation of energy-saving measures in the house, such as insulation and air sealing. In developing such incentive program, each utility shall utilize the stakeholder process set forth in § [56-596.2](/vacode/56-596.2/). The utility may provide such incentives directly to customers or to organizations that assist low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals. Such incentive program shall be deemed to be a part of the $140 million in energy efficiency programs that a Phase I utility is required to develop pursuant to § [56-596.2](/vacode/56-596.2/) and a part of the $870 million in energy efficiency programs that a Phase II utility is required to develop pursuant to § [56-596.2](/vacode/56-596.2/); provided that no portion of such incentive programs shall be deemed to be a part of the required five percent of such energy conservation measures set aside for low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals.

B. For (i) low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals or (ii) organizations providing residential services to low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals who participate in, or have already participated in, an incentive program, including the incentive program described in subsection A, for the installation of measures that reduce heating or cooling costs at any premises where people reside, each Phase I and Phase II Utility shall submit a petition for approval to design, implement, and operate a separate three-year incentive program, in an amount not to exceed $25 million in the aggregate, to enable the installation of, or access to, equipment to generate electric energy derived from sunlight. The utility may provide such incentives directly to customers or to organizations that assist low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals. Such incentive program may include installation of equipment directly on the premises or access to equipment located elsewhere, provided such installation or access reduces the total energy costs for persons described in clause (i) or (ii). Such incentive program shall not be deemed to be a part of the $140 million in energy efficiency programs that a Phase I utility is required to develop pursuant to § [56-596.2](/vacode/56-596.2/) nor a part of the $870 million in energy efficiency programs that a Phase II utility is required to develop pursuant to § [56-596.2](/vacode/56-596.2/).

C. In developing such incentive programs, each utility shall give consideration to low-income, elderly, and disabled persons residing in housing that a redevelopment and housing authority owns or controls.
