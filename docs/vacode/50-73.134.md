# § 50-73.134 Registered limited liability partnership annual continuation reports; automatic cancellation of registration; restoration of status.

A. On or before July 1 of each year after the calendar year in which it became registered under § [50-73.132](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.132/), each registered limited liability partnership and each foreign registered limited liability partnership authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth shall file an annual continuation report with the Commission setting forth the name of the partnership, the partnership's current principal office address and, if a foreign registered limited liability partnership, the jurisdiction in which it is registered as a registered limited liability partnership. If the report appears to be incomplete or inaccurate, the Commission shall return it for correction or explanation. Otherwise, it shall be deemed filed in the office of the clerk of the Commission. The report shall be made on forms furnished by the Commission and shall be forwarded by the clerk of the Commission, before June 1, to each registered limited liability partnership.

B. The information required shall be given as of the date of the execution of the report, and it shall be executed by a partner in the registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership or, if a receiver or trustee has been appointed for the partnership, by the receiver or trustee on behalf of the registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership. The report shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in subdivision F 2 of § [50-73.83](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.83/).

C. If any registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership fails to pay the fee or file any report required by this section on or before September 1 of the year due, the Commission shall mail notice to the partnership of the impending cancellation of its registration. Whether or not such notice is mailed, if the partnership fails to file the report or pay the fee on or before November 1 of the year it is due, the registration of the partnership shall be automatically canceled and the partnership shall automatically cease to be a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership as of November 1, but shall continue to be a partnership or limited partnership, as the case may be, under this title.

D. Any partnership formed under the laws of the Commonwealth that has ceased to be a registered limited liability partnership under subsection C shall not be considered to have dissolved as a result of ceasing to be a registered limited liability partnership.

E. A registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership that has ceased to be a registered limited liability partnership or a foreign registered limited liability partnership under subsection C, subsection F of § [50-73.135](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.135/), § [50-73.137](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.137/), [50-73.137:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.137:1/), or [50-73.139](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.139/), as the case may be, may apply to the Commission to have its status as a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership restored within five years of the date on which its status was canceled. To have its status restored, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership shall provide the Commission with the following:

1. An application for restoration signed by a partner of a partnership or a general partner of a limited partnership, as the case may be;

2. A restoration fee of $100;

3. An annual continuation report and payment of the fee due upon filing the annual continuation report for the year in which restoration is sought, unless the report previously was filed;

4. All fees that were due before its status as a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership was canceled and that would have become due thereafter for the filing of its annual continuation reports if its status had not been canceled;

5. Any amendment to its statement of registration with the Commission as required by subsection D of § [50-73.136](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.136/); and

6. If the registered limited liability partnership's or foreign registered limited liability partnership's registered agent has filed a certificate of resignation and a new registered agent has not been appointed, a certificate of change pursuant to § [50-73.135](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.135/).

F. The automatic cancellation of a foreign registered limited liability partnership's registration constitutes the appointment of the clerk of the Commission as the foreign registered limited liability partnership's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time the foreign registered limited liability partnership was registered to transact business in the Commonwealth. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission under this subsection is service on the foreign registered limited liability partnership and shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § [12.1-19.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/12.1-19.1/).

G. Cancellation of a foreign registered limited liability partnership's registration does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the foreign registered limited liability partnership.

H. A registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership that has ceased to be a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership under this section, subsection F of § [50-73.135](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.135/), § [50-73.137](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.137/), [50-73.137:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.137:1/), or [50-73.139](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.139/) that restores its status as a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership shall be deemed not to have lost its status as a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership under this article.

I. The Commission shall not file with respect to any domestic or foreign registered limited liability partnership any statement referred to in this chapter until all annual continuation reports required to be filed with the Commission under this article have been filed.
