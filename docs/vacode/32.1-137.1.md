"Covered person" means an individual residing in the Commonwealth, whether a policyholder, subscriber, enrollee, or member of a managed care health insurance plan, who is entitled to health care services or benefits provided, arranged for, paid for or reimbursed pursuant to a managed care health insurance plan under Title 38.2.

"Managed care health insurance plan" means an arrangement for the delivery of health care in which a health carrier as defined in § [38.2-5800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-5800/) undertakes to provide, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse any of the costs of health care services for a covered person on a prepaid or insured basis which (i) contains one or more incentive arrangements, including any credentialing requirements intended to influence the cost or level of health care services between the health carrier and one or more providers with respect to the delivery of health care services; and (ii) requires or creates benefit payment differential incentives for covered persons to use providers that are directly or indirectly managed, owned, under contract with or employed by the health carrier. Any health maintenance organization as defined in § [38.2-4300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-4300/) or health carrier that offers preferred provider contracts or policies as defined in § [38.2-3407](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3407/) or preferred provider subscription contracts as defined in § [38.2-4209](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-4209/) shall be deemed to be offering one or more managed care health insurance plans.
