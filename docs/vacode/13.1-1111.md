# § 13.1-1111 Qualifications of members and managers; special provisions for limited liability companies rendering service of architects, professional engineers, land surveyors and landscape architects, and using the title of certified interior designers.

Not less than two-thirds of the membership interests of a professional limited liability company rendering the services of architects, professional engineers, land surveyors, or landscape architects, or using the title of certified interior designers, or any combination thereof, shall be held by individuals duly licensed or professional business entities legally authorized to render the services of architects, professional engineers, land surveyors, or landscape architects, or by individuals or professional business entities legally authorized to use the title of certified interior designers, and the remainder of the membership interests may be held only by individuals who are employees of the professional limited liability company whether or not those employees are licensed to render professional services or authorized to use a title. For those professional limited liability companies using the title of certified interior designers and providing the services of architects, professional engineers or land surveyors, or any combination thereof, not less than two-thirds of the membership interests of the professional limited liability company shall be held by individuals who are duly licensed. No other professional limited liability company, except for a professional limited liability company engaged in the practice of accounting as described in § [13.1-1112](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1112/), may have as a member anyone other than an individual or a professional business entity that is duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render the same professional services as those for which the professional limited liability company was organized.

As an additional prerequisite for a professional limited liability company's engaging in the practice of the professions of architecture, professional engineering, land surveying, or landscape architecture, or using the title of certified interior designer, or any combination thereof, that professional limited liability company shall secure a certificate of authority, which may be renewable and may be either general or limited, from the Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, Certified Interior Designers and Landscape Architects. The certificate of authority shall be issued or renewed by the Board when in its discretion the professional limited liability company is in compliance with rules and regulations which shall be promulgated by the Board consistent with its jurisdiction to provide adequate safeguards for the public's health, welfare and safety. The fees for a certificate of authority as described above shall be the same fees as provided for in Chapter 4 (§ [54.1-400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-400/) et seq.) of Title 54.1.
