# ยง 38.2-2605 Expiration and renewal of license.

Every home protection company licensed under this chapter shall obtain a renewal of its license annually from the Commission. Every license issued under this chapter shall expire at midnight on June 30 immediately following the date of issuance. No renewal license shall be issued unless the home protection company has paid all taxes, fees, assessments and other charges imposed upon it, and has complied with all the other requirements of law. The Commission shall not fail or refuse to renew the license of any home protection company without giving the home protection company ten days' notice of the failure or refusal to renew and providing it an opportunity to be heard and to introduce evidence in its behalf. Any such hearing may be informal, and the required notice may be waived by the Commission and the home protection company.
