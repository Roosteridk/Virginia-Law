# § 62.1-44.16:1 Local enforcement of industrial waste permits.

A. Any locality that has adopted an ordinance for the testing and monitoring of the land application of industrial wastes pursuant to § [62.1-44.16](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.16/) shall have the authority to order the abatement of any violation of § [62.1-44.16](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.16/) or of any violation of any permit or certificate issued under that section. Such abatement order shall identify the activity constituting the violation, specify the provision of the Code of Virginia or permit condition violated by the activity, and order that the activity cease immediately.

B. In the event of any dispute concerning the existence of a violation, the activity alleged to be in violation shall be halted pending a determination by the Director, whose decision shall be final and binding unless reversed on judicial appeal pursuant to § [2.2-4026](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4026/). Any person who fails or refuses to halt such activity may be compelled to do so by injunction issued by a court having competent jurisdiction. Upon determination by the Director that there has been a violation of § [62.1-44.16](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.16/) or of any permit or certificate issued under that section and that such violation poses an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare, the Department shall commence appropriate action to abate the violation and immediately notify the chief administrative officer of any locality potentially affected by the violation. Neither the Board, the Commonwealth, nor any employee of the Commonwealth shall be liable for failing to provide the notification required by this section.

C. Local governments shall promptly notify the Department of all results from the testing and monitoring of the land application of industrial wastes performed by persons employed by local governments and any violation of § [62.1-44.16](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.16/) or of any violation of any permit or certificate issued under that section, discovered by local governments.
