The advocate shall not, with respect to the case to which he is assigned, provide legal counsel or advice to any person, appear as counsel in court or in proceedings which are part of the judicial process, or engage in the unauthorized practice of law. The advocate may testify if called as a witness.

C. The program director shall assign an advocate to a child when requested to do so by the judge of the juvenile and domestic relations district court having jurisdiction over the proceedings. The advocate shall continue his association with each case to which he is assigned until relieved of his duties by the court or by the program director. The program director may assign an advocate to attend and participate in family partnership meetings as defined by the Department of Social Services and in meetings of family assessment and planning teams established pursuant to § [2.2-5208](/vacode/2.2-5208/), multidisciplinary child sexual abuse response teams established pursuant to § [15.2-1627.5](/vacode/15.2-1627.5/), individualized education program teams established pursuant to Article 2 (§ [22.1-213](/vacode/22.1-213/) et seq.) of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1, and multidisciplinary teams established pursuant to §§ [63.2-1503](/vacode/63.2-1503/) and [63.2-1505](/vacode/63.2-1505/).
