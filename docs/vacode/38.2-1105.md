B. The captive insurer shall deposit with the State Treasurer cash, bonds, or securities equal to the minimum capital or, if a mutual insurer, fifty percent of the minimum surplus, as required by Article 5 (§ [38.2-1024](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1024/) et seq.) of Chapter 10 of this title.
