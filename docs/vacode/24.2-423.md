# § 24.2-423 Notice of change of name of registered voter.

Whenever a registered voter changes his legal name, either by marriage, divorce, order of court, or otherwise, the voter shall promptly notify the general registrar of the jurisdiction where he is registered. Such notice may be made in writing or on a form approved by the State Board of Elections, which may be electronic. The notice in writing may be provided by mail or by facsimile and shall be signed by the voter unless he is physically unable to sign, in which case his own mark acknowledged by a witness shall be sufficient signature. Notice may be provided by electronic means as authorized by the State Board and signed by the voter in a manner consistent with the provisions of § [24.2-416.7](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-416.7/) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (§ [59.1-479](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-479/) et seq.). The general registrar shall enter the new name on the registration records and issue the voter a new voter registration card.
