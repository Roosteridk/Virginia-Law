The annual hunting stamp shall be in addition to the required licenses to hunt, and the cost of such stamp shall be the same as the cost of the annual state resident hunting license in § [29.1-303](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/29.1-303/).

16. Revise, as it deems appropriate, through the promulgation of regulations as prescribed in Article 1 (§ [29.1-500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/29.1-500/) et seq.), the fees charged for all hunting, fishing and trapping licenses authorized under Articles 1 (§ [29.1-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/29.1-300/) et seq.) and 2 (§ [29.1-340](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/29.1-340/) et seq.) of Chapter 3, notwithstanding any other provision of this title.
