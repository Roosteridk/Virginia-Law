Such conditions as the court deems appropriate shall include, but not be limited to, a requirement that the defendant agree not to assert the statute of limitations as a defense if the action is brought in a more convenient forum within a time specified by the court. The court, on motion of any party and for good cause shown, may retain the action for trial. Except by agreement of all parties, no action enumerated in Category A, § [8.01-261](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-261/), shall be transferred to or retained by a forum not enumerated in such category. Good cause shall be deemed to include, but not to be limited to, the agreement of the parties or the avoidance of substantial inconvenience to the parties or the witnesses, or complying with the law of any other state or the United States.

The provisions of (i) of this section shall not apply to causes of action which accrue under § [8.01-249](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-249/)(4).
