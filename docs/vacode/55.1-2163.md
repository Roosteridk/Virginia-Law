# § 55.1-2163 Release of liens.

A. In the case of a sale of a cooperative interest where delivery of a public offering statement is required pursuant to subsection C of § [55.1-2154](/vacode/55.1-2154/), a seller shall, before conveying a cooperative interest, record or furnish to the purchaser releases of all liens affecting the unit that is a part of that cooperative interest and any limited common element assigned to such unit, except liens solely against the unit and any limited common element assigned to such unit, that the purchaser expressly agrees to take subject to or assume. Releases of liens shall be made pursuant to §§ [55.1-339](/vacode/55.1-339/) through [55.1-345](/vacode/55.1-345/). This subsection does not apply to any real estate that a declarant has the right to withdraw.

B. Before conveying real estate to the association, the declarant shall have that real estate released from (i) all liens the foreclosure of which would deprive proprietary lessees of any right of access to or easement of support of their units and (ii) all other liens on such real estate unless the public offering statement describes certain real estate that may be conveyed subject to liens in specified amounts.
