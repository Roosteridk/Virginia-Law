# ยง 64.2-1215 Power of commissioner of accounts to enforce the filing of inventories.

A. If any fiduciary fails to make the return required by ยง [64.2-1300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1300/), the commissioner of accounts shall issue, through the sheriff or other proper officer, a summons to the fiduciary requiring him to make such return. If the fiduciary fails to make the required return within 30 days after the date of service of the summons, the commissioner of accounts shall report the fact to the circuit court. The court shall immediately issue a summons to the fiduciary requiring him to appear and shall, upon his appearance, assess a fine against the fiduciary in an amount not to exceed $500 unless excused for sufficient reason. If, after his appearance before the court, the fiduciary continues to fail to make the required return within such time as the court may prescribe, the fiduciary shall be punished for contempt of court.

B. Whenever the commissioner of accounts reports to the court that a fiduciary who is an attorney-at-law licensed to practice in the Commonwealth has failed to make the required return within 30 days after the date of service of a summons, the commissioner of accounts shall also mail a copy of his report to the Virginia State Bar.
