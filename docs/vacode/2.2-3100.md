# § 2.2-3100 Policy; application; construction.

The General Assembly, recognizing that our system of representative government is dependent in part upon (i) citizen legislative members representing fully the public in the legislative process and (ii) its citizens maintaining the highest trust in their public officers and employees, finds and declares that the citizens are entitled to be assured that the judgment of public officers and employees will be guided by a law that defines and prohibits inappropriate conflicts and requires disclosure of economic interests. To that end and for the purpose of establishing a single body of law applicable to all state and local government officers and employees on the subject of conflict of interests, the General Assembly enacts this State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act so that the standards of conduct for such officers and employees may be uniform throughout the Commonwealth.

This chapter shall supersede all general and special acts and charter provisions which purport to deal with matters covered by this chapter except that the provisions of §§ [15.2-852](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-852/), [15.2-2287](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2287/), [15.2-2287.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2287.1/), and [15.2-2289](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2289/) and ordinances adopted pursuant thereto shall remain in force and effect. The provisions of this chapter shall be supplemented but not superseded by the provisions on ethics in public contracting in Article 6 (§ [2.2-4367](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4367/) et seq.) of Chapter 43 of this title and ordinances adopted pursuant to § [2.2-3104.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3104.2/) regulating receipt of gifts.

The provisions of this chapter do not preclude prosecution for any violation of any criminal law of the Commonwealth, including Articles 2 (Bribery and Related Offenses, § [18.2-438](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-438/) et seq.) and 3 (Bribery of Public Servants and Party Officials, § [18.2-446](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-446/) et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 18.2, and do not constitute a defense to any prosecution for such a violation.

This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose.
