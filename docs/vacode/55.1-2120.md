# § 55.1-2120 Exercise of development rights.

A. To exercise any development right reserved under subdivision A 8 of § [55.1-2116](/vacode/55.1-2116/), the declarant shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration as specified in § [55.1-2127](/vacode/55.1-2127/). The amendment to the declaration must assign an identifying number to each new unit created and, except in the case of subdivision or conversion of units described in subsection B, reallocate the allocated interests among all cooperative interests. The amendment must describe any common elements and any limited common elements created by such amendment and, in the case of limited common elements, designate to which of the units each is allocated to the extent required by § [55.1-2119](/vacode/55.1-2119/).

B. Development rights may be reserved within any real estate added to the cooperative if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by § [55.1-2116](/vacode/55.1-2116/) or [55.1-2117](/vacode/55.1-2117/), as appropriate. This provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to subdivision A 8 of § [55.1-2116](/vacode/55.1-2116/).

C. Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units, common elements, or both:

1. If the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part among the other cooperative interests as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain.

2. If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part among the cooperative interests created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.

D. If the declaration provides, pursuant to subdivision A 8 of § [55.1-2116](/vacode/55.1-2116/), that all of or a portion of the real estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal:

1. If all the real estate is subject to withdrawal, and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest has been conveyed to a purchaser; and

2. If a portion or portions are subject to withdrawal, no portion may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest in that portion has been conveyed to a purchaser.
