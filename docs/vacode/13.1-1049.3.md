Provision need not be made for any claim that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under subsection C of § [13.1-1049.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1049.2/).

C. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown in any proceeding brought under this section. The reasonable fees and expenses of such guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the dissolved limited liability company.
