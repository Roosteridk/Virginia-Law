A. Except as provided in § [38.2-2010](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2010/), no filing shall become effective, be applied, or be used in this Commonwealth until it has been approved by the Commission. However, a rate produced in accordance with a rating schedule or rating plan, previously approved by the Commission, may be used pending the approval.

B. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter and to become effective unless disapproved by the Commission within sixty days of the time that the filing was made. However, the Commission may extend the waiting period for thirty additional days by written notice to the filer before the sixty-day period expires.

C. If a filing is not accompanied by the information necessary for the Commission to determine if the requirements of § [38.2-2005](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2005/) are satisfied, the Commission shall so inform the filer within sixty days of the initial filing. The filing shall be deemed to be made when the necessary information is furnished.

D. The provisions of subsection B of this section shall be suspended when the Commission has ordered a hearing to be held under the provisions of § [38.2-2007](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2007/).
