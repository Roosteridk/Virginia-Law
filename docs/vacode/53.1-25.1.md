# ยง 53.1-25.1 Rules of state correctional facilities.

A. The Director shall prescribe rules for state correctional facilities to ensure that when physical contact is required between an officer and an inmate and when the inmate is required by circumstances to disrobe, to the greatest extent possible, the officer shall be the same gender as the inmate. However, such rules may allow for the suspension of the provisions of this subsection during the period of a declared emergency.

B. When contact is required between an officer and an inmate and when the inmate is required by circumstances to disrobe and the officer is not the same gender as the inmate, the officer involved shall submit a written report to the warden or other official in charge of the state correctional facility within 72 hours following the incident, containing the justification for the suspension of the provisions of subsection A.
