# § 33.2-214 Transportation; Six-Year Improvement Program.

A. The Board shall have the power and duty to monitor and, where necessary, approve actions taken by the Department of Rail and Public Transportation pursuant to Article 5 (§ [33.2-281](/vacode/33.2-281/) et seq.) in order to ensure the efficient and economical development of public transportation, the enhancement of rail transportation, and the coordination of such rail and public transportation plans with highway programs.

B. The Board shall have the power and duty to coordinate the planning for financing of transportation needs, including needs for highways, railways, seaports, airports, and public transportation and set aside funds as provided in § [33.2-1524.1](/vacode/33.2-1524.1/). To allocate funds for these needs pursuant to § [33.2-358](/vacode/33.2-358/) and Chapter 15 (§ [33.2-1500](/vacode/33.2-1500/) et seq.), the Board shall adopt a Six-Year Improvement Program of anticipated projects and programs by July 1 of each year. This program shall be based on the most recent official Commonwealth Transportation Fund revenue forecast and shall be consistent with a debt management policy adopted by the Board in consultation with the Debt Capacity Advisory Committee and the Department of the Treasury.

C. The Board shall have the power and duty to enter into contracts with local districts, commissions, agencies, or other entities created for transportation purposes.

D. The Board shall have the power and duty to promote increasing private investment in the Commonwealth's transportation infrastructure, including acquisition of causeways, bridges, tunnels, highways, and other transportation facilities.

E. The Board shall only include a project or program wholly or partially funded with funds from the State of Good Repair Program pursuant to § [33.2-369](/vacode/33.2-369/), the High Priority Projects Program pursuant to § [33.2-370](/vacode/33.2-370/), the Highway Construction District Grant Programs pursuant to § [33.2-371](/vacode/33.2-371/), or the Interstate Operations and Enhancement Program pursuant to § [33.2-372](/vacode/33.2-372/), or capital projects funded through the Virginia Highway Safety Improvement Program pursuant to § [33.2-373](/vacode/33.2-373/) in the Six-Year Improvement Program if the allocation of funds from those programs and other funding committed to such project or program within the six-year horizon of the Six-Year Improvement Program is sufficient to complete the project or program. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any project (i) the design and construction of which cannot be completed within six years, (ii) the estimated costs of which exceed $2 billion, and (iii) that requires the Board to exercise its authority to waive the funding cap pursuant to subsection B of § [33.2-369](/vacode/33.2-369/).

F. The Board shall have the power and duty to integrate land use with transportation planning and programming, consistent with the efficient and economical use of public funds. If the Board determines that a local transportation plan described in § [15.2-2223](/vacode/15.2-2223/) or any amendment as described in § [15.2-2229](/vacode/15.2-2229/) or a metropolitan regional long-range transportation plan or regional Transportation Improvement Program as described in § [33.2-3201](/vacode/33.2-3201/) is not consistent with the Board's Statewide Transportation Plan developed pursuant to § [33.2-353](/vacode/33.2-353/), the Six-Year Improvement Program adopted pursuant to subsection B, and the location of routes to be followed by roads comprising systems of state highways pursuant to subsection A of § [33.2-208](/vacode/33.2-208/), the Board shall notify the locality of such inconsistency and request that the applicable plan or program be amended accordingly. If, after a reasonable time, the Board determines that there is a refusal to amend the plan or program, then the Board may reallocate funds that were allocated to the nonconforming project as permitted by state or federal law. However, the Board shall not reallocate any funds allocated pursuant to § [33.2-319](/vacode/33.2-319/) or [33.2-366](/vacode/33.2-366/), based on a determination of inconsistency with the Board's Statewide Transportation Plan or the Six-Year Improvement Program nor shall the Board reallocate any funds, allocated pursuant to subsection C or D of § [33.2-358](/vacode/33.2-358/), from any projects on highways controlled by any county that has withdrawn, or elects to withdraw, from the secondary system of state highways based on a determination of inconsistency with the Board's Statewide Transportation Plan or the Six-Year Improvement Program. If a locality or metropolitan planning organization requests the termination of a project, and the Department does not agree to the termination, or if a locality or metropolitan planning organization does not advance a project to the next phase of construction when requested by the Board and the Department has expended state or federal funds, the locality or the localities within the metropolitan planning organization may be required to reimburse the Department for all funds expended on the project. If, after design approval by the Chief Engineer of the Department, a locality or metropolitan planning organization requests alterations to a project that, in the aggregate, exceeds 10 percent of the total project costs, the locality or the localities within the metropolitan planning organization may be required to reimburse the Department for the additional project costs above the original estimates for making such alterations.
