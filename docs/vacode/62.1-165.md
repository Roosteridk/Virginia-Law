# ยง 62.1-165 Erection of wharves at county landings.

Any person desiring the privilege of erecting a wharf at or on any county landing may, after giving notice of his intention by advertising such notice at some public place near the landing, and also at the front door of the courthouse of such county, on the first day of a term of the circuit court of the county, present to the court at its next term a petition for such privilege. The court may determine the same, and may, in its discretion, grant such privilege and fix such rates and charges upon such conditions and limitations as to it may seem fit. The court, at any subsequent term, may, if it think proper, revoke such privilege, or alter such conditions or limitations, or regulate the rates and charges. This section shall not be construed to authorize a circuit court of the county to grant the privilege of erecting a wharf within a city.
