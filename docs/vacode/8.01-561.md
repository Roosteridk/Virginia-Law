# ยง 8.01-561 How property to be kept; how sold, when expensive to keep or perishable.

Any property seized under any attachment and not sold before judgment shall be kept in the same manner as similar property taken under execution. But such as is expensive to keep or perishable may be sold by order of the court upon such terms as the court may direct. If the court directs that the sale may be made on credit, the court may order the sheriff to take a bond with sufficient surety, payable to the sheriff, for the benefit of the party entitled. Such bond shall be returned forthwith by the officer to the court.
