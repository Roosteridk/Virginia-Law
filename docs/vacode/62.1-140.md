A. As used in this section and in §§ [62.1-141](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-141/) through [62.1-146](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-146/), the term "port facility" means harbors, seaports and all facilities used in connection therewith and shall include all those facilities named in §§ [62.1-132.18](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-132.18/) and [62.1-132.19](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-132.19/).

The term "cost" as used in this chapter embraces the cost of construction, the cost of the acquisition of all land, rights-of-way, property, rights, easements and interests acquired by the Authority for such construction, the cost of all machinery and equipment, financing charges, interest prior to and during construction and, if deemed advisable by the Authority, for one year after completion of construction, engineering and legal expenses, cost of plans, specifications, surveys and estimates of cost and of revenues, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of constructing any port facility, administrative expense, the creation of a working capital fund for placing the port facility in operation and such other expense as may be necessary or incident to the construction of such port facility, the financing of such construction and the placing of the same in operation.

The term "bonds" as used in this chapter means obligations of the Authority for the payment of borrowed money. For purposes of the limitations imposed by subsections B and C of § [62.1-140](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-140/), contingent obligations to reimburse providers for amounts drawn under credit facilities, letters of credit, lines of credit, guarantees, standby bond purchase agreements, or other credit or liquidity enhancement facilities, including any such enhancement facility obtained by the Authority for deposit into any reserve account or fund relating to any bonds, shall not constitute bonds.

For purposes of the limitations imposed by subsections B and C of § [62.1-140](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-140/), the term "revenue bonds" means bonds for which only the revenues of port facilities are pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds.

B. The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any Authority project for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction or control of port facilities or of any portion or portions thereof, provided that the total principal amount of bonds, including refunding bonds, outstanding at any time shall not exceed $200 million, excluding from such limit any revenue bonds.

All of the bonds of one or more series of the bonds of the Authority at any time outstanding may be refunded by the Authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the Authority may deem necessary, but not exceeding an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with all unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and with any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as determined by the Authority. The proceeds of any such refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the Authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof, and may, pending such application, be placed in trust in accordance with the provisions of § [62.1-143](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-143/) of this chapter to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the Authority. All refunding bonds may have all of the attributes of revenue bonds to the extent that such other provisions of this chapter relating to revenue bonds may be applicable to refunding bonds.

C. The principal of and the interest on all bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the prevailing rate of interest at the time, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth.

All bonds shall be signed by the Executive Director of the Authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary of the Authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Executive Director of the Authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction and control of port facilities or the portion thereof for which such bonds shall have been issued, or, in the case of refunding bonds, to refund such bonds including any unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as shall be determined by the Authority upon the issuance of such refunding bonds, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or, if such bonds shall have been issued for paying the cost of a portion of the project, such surplus may be applied to the payment of the cost of any remaining portion of the project.

Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.

The Authority shall not issue any bonds, other than revenue bonds or any refunding bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the second paragraph of subsection B of § [62.1-140](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-140/), which are not specifically authorized by a bill or resolution passed by a majority vote of those elected to each house of the General Assembly. Refunding bonds may only be issued with the consent of the Governor. However, the Governor, in his sole discretion, may approve bonds which have not been authorized by the General Assembly if such bonds are to finance capital projects that emerge between legislative sessions, provided the debt is required to stimulate commerce consistent with § [62.1-132.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-132.3/) and provided that:

1. The total amount of such bonds added to the total amount of Virginia Port Authority bonds currently authorized does not exceed the limit in § [62.1-140](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-140/) B;

2. Funds are available within the appropriations, if needed, without adverse effect on other projects or programs, or from unappropriated nongeneral fund revenues or balances;

3. In the Governor's opinion such action may result in a measurable benefit to the Commonwealth;

4. The authorization includes a detailed description of the project, the project need, the total project costs, the estimated operating costs, and the fund sources for the project and its operating costs;

5. The requirements of Chapter 11.1 (§ [10.1-1182](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1182/) et seq.), Title 10.1, regarding environmental impact statements, will be met as a precondition for the approval of the project; and

6. The authorization of any such debt as provided for in this section shall be promptly communicated to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees.
