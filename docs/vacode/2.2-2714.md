# ยง 2.2-2714 Estimated amount of prudent tax-supported debt; affordability considerations.

Before January 1 of each year, the Committee shall submit to the Governor and to the General Assembly the Committee's estimate of tax-supported debt that prudently may be authorized for the next fiscal year, together with a report explaining the basis for the estimate. In developing its annual estimate and in preparing its annual report, the Committee shall, at a minimum, consider:

1. The amount of tax-supported debt that, during the next fiscal year and annually for the following nine fiscal years (i) will be outstanding and (ii) has been authorized but not yet issued;

2. A projected schedule of affordable, state tax-supported debt authorizations for the next biennium. The assessment of the affordability of the projected authorizations shall include but not be limited to the considerations specified in this section;

3. Projected debt-service requirements during the next fiscal year and annually for the following nine fiscal years based upon (i) existing outstanding debt, (ii) previously authorized but unissued debt, and (iii) projected bond authorizations;

4. The criteria that recognized bond rating agencies use to judge the quality of issues of Commonwealth bonds;

5. Any other factor that is relevant to (i) the ability of the Commonwealth to meet its projected debt service requirements for the next two fiscal years; (ii) the ability of the Commonwealth to support additional debt service in the upcoming biennium; (iii) the requirements of the statewide capital plan; and (iv) the interest rate to be borne by, the credit rating on, or any other factor affecting the marketability of such bonds; and

6. The effect of authorizations of new tax-supported debt on each of the considerations of this section.
