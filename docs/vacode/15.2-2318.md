# § 15.2-2318 Definitions.

As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:

"Cost" includes, in addition to all labor, materials, machinery and equipment for construction, (i) acquisition of land, rights-of-way, property rights, easements and interests, including the costs of moving or relocating utilities, (ii) demolition or removal of any structure on land so acquired, including acquisition of land to which such structure may be moved, (iii) survey, engineering, and architectural expenses, (iv) legal, administrative, and other related expenses, and (v) interest charges and other financing costs if impact fees are used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the locality to finance the road improvement.

"Impact fee" means a charge or assessment imposed against new development in order to generate revenue to fund or recover the costs of reasonable road improvements benefiting the new development. Impact fees may not be assessed and imposed for road repair, operation and maintenance, nor to meet demand which existed prior to the new development.

"Impact fee service area" means an area designated within the comprehensive plan of a locality having clearly defined boundaries and clearly related traffic needs and within which development is to be subject to the assessment of impact fees.

"Road improvement" includes construction of new roads or improvement or expansion of existing roads and related appurtenances as required by applicable standards of the Virginia Department of Transportation, or the applicable standards of a locality with road maintenance responsibilities, to meet increased demand attributable to new development. Road improvements do not include on-site construction of roads which a developer may be required to provide pursuant to §§ [15.2-2241](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2241/) through [15.2-2245](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2245/).
