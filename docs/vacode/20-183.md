# ยง 20-183 Waiver and preclusion of privilege.

A. A privilege under ยง [20-182](/vacode/20-182/) may be waived in a record or orally during a proceeding if it is expressly waived by all parties and, in the case of the privilege of a nonparty participant, it is also expressly waived by such participant.

B. A person who makes a disclosure or representation about a collaborative law communication that prejudices another person in a proceeding shall not assert a privilege under ยง [20-182](/vacode/20-182/); such preclusion applies only to the extent necessary for the person prejudiced to respond to the disclosure or representation.
