# § 45.2-543  When the Chief may cause maps to be made; payment by operator.

A. If the operator of any mine or his agent neglects or fails to furnish to the Chief a copy of any map or extension thereof, as provided in § [45.2-542](/vacode/45.2-542/), the Chief may cause a correct survey and map of such mine, or extension of the map, to be made at the expense of the operator of the mine, the cost of which shall be recovered from the operator as other debts are recoverable by a civil action at law.

B. If at any time the Chief has reason to believe that a map or extension thereof furnished pursuant to § [45.2-542](/vacode/45.2-542/) is substantially incorrect or will not serve the purpose for which it is intended, he may have a survey and map or extension thereof made or corrected. The expense of making such survey and map or extension thereof shall be paid by the operator. The expense shall be recovered from the operator, as other debts are recoverable by a civil action at law. However, if the map filed by the operator is found to be substantially correct, the expense shall be paid by the Commonwealth.
