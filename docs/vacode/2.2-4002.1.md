The guidance document shall be subject to a 30-day public comment period, to include public comment through the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall website, after publication in the Virginia Register of Regulations and prior to its effective date.

The agency shall provide notice of the opportunity for public comment to interested parties as identified under ยง [2.2-4007.02](/vacode/2.2-4007.02/) prior to the start of the 30-day public comment period.

During this additional period, the agency shall respond to any such comments in writing by certified mail to the commenter or by posting the response electronically in a manner consistent with the provisions for publication of comments on regulations provided in this chapter. Any person who remains aggrieved after the effective date of the final guidance document may avail himself of the remedies articulated in Article 5 (ยง [2.2-4025](/vacode/2.2-4025/) et seq.).
