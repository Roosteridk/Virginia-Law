A. The Attorney General, the Commission, or any party to a mortgage loan may enforce the provisions of §§ [6.2-1614](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1614/), [6.2-1615](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1615/), and [6.2-1616](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1616/).

B. In any suit instituted by a borrower who alleges that the defendant violated § [6.2-1614](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1614/), [6.2-1615](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1615/), or [6.2-1616](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1616/), the presiding judge may, in the judge's discretion, allow reasonable attorney fees to the attorney representing the prevailing party. The attorney fees shall be taxed as a part of the court costs and payable by the losing party upon a finding by the presiding judge that (i) the party charged with the violation has willfully engaged in the act or practice with which he was charged or (ii) the party instituting the action knew, or should have known, that the action was frivolous and malicious.

C. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and shall not impair, the rights of and remedies available to borrowers in mortgage loans otherwise provided by law.
