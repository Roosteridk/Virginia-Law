# § 37.2-713 Residence of individuals in state facilities and school-age children in state facilities generally.

For purposes of eligibility for and receipt of social services and public assistance, each individual receiving services in a state facility shall be deemed a resident of the county or city in which he resided at the time of his admission to the state facility, and not of the county or city in which the state facility is located. The Department shall be entitled to receive annually from the Board of Education and the school division where the individual resided at the time of his admission a sum equal to the required local expenditure per pupil, as set forth in the appropriation act, and an additional payment for special education, as applicable, for support of the individual's education. This amount shall be paid by the Board of Education, and the Board shall then deduct that payment from the amount payable by the Board of Education from the basic school aid fund to the school division.
