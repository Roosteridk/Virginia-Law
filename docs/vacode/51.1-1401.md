The amount of each monthly health insurance credit payable under this section shall be $4 for each full year of the retired member's creditable service; however, each former member whose retirement was for disability, any employee participant pursuant to § [51.1-126.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126.6/) receiving long-term disability, a participant receiving long-term disability pursuant to § [51.1-1157](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1157/) or [51.1-1165](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1165/), or a member of the hybrid retirement program receiving long-term disability pursuant to coverage under subsection A of § [51.1-1153](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1153/) shall receive a monthly health insurance credit of $4 multiplied by the smaller of (i) twice the amount of his creditable service or (ii) the amount of creditable service he would have completed at age 60 if he had remained in service to that age. Eligibility for the credit shall be determined in a manner prescribed by the Virginia Retirement System. Any member who elects to defer his retirement pursuant to subsection C of § [51.1-153](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-153/) shall be entitled to receive the allowable credit provided by this section on the effective date of his retirement.

Eligibility for the credit and payment of the credit shall be determined in a manner prescribed by the Virginia Retirement System.

The Commonwealth and local school division, if appropriate, shall be charged with the credit as provided for in subsection E. In such case, the health insurance credit shall be determined based upon the amount of state service or service as a teacher, whichever is greater.

E. The Virginia Retirement System shall (i) actuarially determine the amount necessary to fund all credits provided under this section; (ii) reflect the cost of such credits in the applicable employer contribution rate pursuant to §§ [51.1-145](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-145/), [51.1-204](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-204/), and [51.1-304](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-304/); and (iii) prescribe such terms and conditions as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
