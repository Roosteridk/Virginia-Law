# § 13.1-1099.23 Registration of foreign series limited liability company and foreign protected series; amended application; voluntary cancellation; reinstatement.

A. A foreign series limited liability company shall obtain from the Commission a certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth before any foreign protected series of the foreign series limited liability company is registered to transact business in the Commonwealth. In addition to the requirements for registration in § [13.1-1052](/vacode/13.1-1052/), the foreign series limited liability company shall include an attachment to its application that lists the name of each foreign protected series of the foreign series limited liability company and the jurisdiction under whose law each is established.

B. Except as otherwise provided in this section and subject to §§ [13.1-1099.8](/vacode/13.1-1099.8/) and [13.1-1099.10](/vacode/13.1-1099.10/), the provisions of Article 10 (§ [13.1-1051](/vacode/13.1-1051/) et seq.) governing foreign limited liability companies apply to a foreign protected series as if the foreign protected series were a foreign limited liability company organized separately from the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series and distinct from the foreign series limited liability company and any other foreign protected series of the foreign series limited liability company.

C. An application by a foreign protected series for a certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth shall meet the requirements of § [13.1-1052](/vacode/13.1-1052/) and shall also include:

1. The name, jurisdiction of formation, and post office address of the principal office of the foreign protected series applying for registration; and

2. The name and jurisdiction of formation of the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series.

D. The registered agent and registered office of a foreign protected series shall be the same as the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series.

E. The name of a foreign protected series applying for a certificate of registration or registered to transact business in the Commonwealth shall comply with § [13.1-1096](/vacode/13.1-1096/). A foreign protected series may comply with § [13.1-1096](/vacode/13.1-1096/) pursuant to § [13.1-1054](/vacode/13.1-1054/).

F. The requirement in § [13.1-1055](/vacode/13.1-1055/) to amend an application for registration of a foreign limited liability company shall be applicable to a foreign protected series that has a certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth.

G. Whenever the certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth of a foreign series limited liability company is canceled, any certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth issued to a foreign protected series of the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series shall thereupon be automatically canceled.

H. A foreign protected series whose certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth has been canceled may have its certificate of registration reinstated in accordance with § [13.1-1056.3](/vacode/13.1-1056.3/) as if it were a foreign limited liability company, provided that the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series has a certificate of registration in effect.

I. A foreign protected series registered to transact business in the Commonwealth may apply to the Commission for a certificate of cancellation to cancel its certificate of registration as a foreign protected series. The application shall be on a form prescribed and furnished by the Commission, which shall set forth:

1. The name of the foreign protected series, the name of the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series, the name of the jurisdiction of formation of the foreign series limited liability company, and the identification number issued by the Commission to the foreign series limited liability company;

2. If applicable, a statement that the foreign series limited liability company that established the foreign protected series was a party to a merger permitted by the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and that it was not the surviving entity of the merger, or has converted to another type of entity under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation;

3. That the foreign protected series is not transacting business in the Commonwealth and that it surrenders its registration to transact business in the Commonwealth;

4. That the foreign protected series revokes the authority of its registered agent to accept service on its behalf and appoints the clerk of the Commission as its agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time it was registered to transact business in the Commonwealth;

5. A mailing address to which the clerk of the Commission may mail a copy of any process served on the clerk under subdivision 4; and

6. A commitment to notify the clerk of the Commission in the future of any change in the mailing address of the foreign protected series.

J. The Commission shall not issue a certificate of cancellation to any foreign protected series unless the foreign protected series files with the Commission a statement certifying that the foreign protected series has filed returns and has paid all state taxes to the time of the statement, or a statement that no returns are required to be filed or taxes are required to be paid. In that case the foreign protected series may file returns and pay taxes before they would otherwise be due. If the Commission finds that the application complies with the requirements of law and all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of cancellation canceling the certificate of registration.

K. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission is service of process on a foreign protected series whose certificate of registration has been canceled pursuant to this section. Service upon the clerk shall be made in accordance with § [12.1-19.1](/vacode/12.1-19.1/), and service upon the foreign protected series may be made in any other manner permitted by law.
