Each stamp affixed and each offer to sell cigarettes in violation of § [3.2-4207](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4207/) shall constitute a separate violation. Upon a determination of a violation of § [3.2-4207](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4207/) or any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Commissioner may also impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) 500 percent of the retail value of the cigarettes sold or (ii) $5,000.

Any cigarettes that have been sold, offered for sale or possessed for sale in the Commonwealth, or imported for personal consumption in the Commonwealth, in violation of § [3.2-4207](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4207/), shall be deemed contraband and may not be sold or offered for sale unless such cigarettes are listed in the Directory. Any such cigarettes that are sold or offered for sale when not included in the Directory shall be subject to confiscation and forfeiture. Any such confiscation and forfeiture shall be governed by the procedures contained in Chapter 22.1 (§ [19.2-386.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.1/) et seq.) of Title 19.2, which shall apply mutatis mutandis; except that all such cigarettes so confiscated and forfeited shall be destroyed and not resold.

In any action brought pursuant to this subsection in which the Commonwealth prevails, the Commonwealth shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs of investigation, costs of the action and reasonable attorney fees.
