# ยง 38.2-1903 Exemptions.

The Commission may by rule exempt any person, class of persons, or market segment from any or all of the provisions of this chapter to the extent that it finds their application unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. Retrospective rating plans and large deductible plans for use in writing workers' compensation insurance for large risks shall be exempt from the filing requirements of Chapter 19 (ยง [38.2-1900](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1900/) et seq.). For purposes of this section, large risks are risks which generate total estimated standard premium for workers' compensation insurance of at least $250,000 annually (or less or in combination with other lines if approved by the Commission). Large deductible plans shall be defined for the purposes of this section as workers' compensation rating plans that include a per claim deductible of at least $100,000. Workers' compensation insurance for large risks may be retrospectively rated, or rated under a large deductible rating plan, as mutually agreed upon by the insurer and the insured in writing. A copy of any large risk retrospective rating plan and large deductible plan shall be made available to the Commission upon request. Notwithstanding these exemptions for retrospective rating plans and large deductible plans for large risks, insurers' experience attributable to large risks shall be filed with the Commission in accordance with ยง [38.2-1919](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1919/).
