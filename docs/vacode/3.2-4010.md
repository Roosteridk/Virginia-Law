# ยง 3.2-4010 Lawn and turf seed; inspection fee.

A. Any person who introduces lawn and turf seed for sale shall pay the Commissioner an annual inspection fee by January 31 following the year in which the sale occurred. The inspection fee shall be the greater of $35 or three-tenths of one percent of the gross sales receipts for lawn and turf seed sold by that person in the Commonwealth during that year. Generally accepted accounting principles shall be used to determine the gross sales receipts. The Commissioner may inspect the sales records of the person required to pay the inspection fee.

B. Any person who fails to pay the inspection fee by January 31 shall be given a grace period of 15 working days from issuance of notification to pay the inspection fee without penalty. Any person who fails to pay the inspection fee by the fifteenth day of the grace period shall also pay a late fee of 10 percent of the inspection fee due or $50, whichever is greater. The assessment of the late fee shall not prohibit the Commissioner from taking further action.
