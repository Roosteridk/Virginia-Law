The Commissioner shall register a pesticide if: (i) he finds the composition of the pesticide warrants any proposed claims; and (ii) the pesticide, its labeling, and any other submitted material comply with the requirements of this chapter. If either condition is not met, the Commissioner shall notify the registrant of the manner in which the pesticide, labeling, or other material fails to comply with the requirements for registration so as to afford the registrant an opportunity to make the necessary correction.
