# ยง 15.2-2158 Fee for street lighting.

A. Frederick County, which provides street lighting service to certain of its residents, may by ordinance charge a fee for the provision of the service, not to exceed the actual cost incurred by the county to procure, develop, and maintain such service, including a reasonable reserve.

B. So long as the benefits of any street lighting can be shown to inure to the specific benefit of identifiable neighborhoods or discrete customers in approximately equivalent amounts, the fee may be calculated by dividing the total amount of the street lighting charge by the number of affected customers.

C. The fee authorized by this section with which the owner of any such property has been charged and which remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property ranking on a parity with liens for unpaid local taxes and administered and enforced in the same manner as provided in Chapter 39 (ยง [58.1-3900](/vacode/58.1-3900/) et seq.) of Title 58.1.
