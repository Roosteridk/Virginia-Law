3. Eighty percent for all other loans.

However, the percentage limits specified in this subsection may be exceeded if the excess is (i) insured or guaranteed or is to be insured or guaranteed by the United States, any state or any agency of either or (ii) insured by an insurer licensed to insure mortgage guaranty risks in this Commonwealth.

If the loan commitment is revised to reflect a change in the value of the real estate, the fair market value shall be determined as of the date of that revision.
