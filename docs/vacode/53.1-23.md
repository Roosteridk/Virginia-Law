B. The Department shall review each person's criminal history record at least 60 days prior to his scheduled release from a state correctional facility to determine whether all offenses for which that person has been committed appear on such record and, if any such offense that is required to be reported to the Central Criminal Records Exchange pursuant to § [19.2-390](/vacode/19.2-390/) does not appear, (i) take and provide fingerprints and a photograph of the person to the Central Criminal Records Exchange to be classified and filed as part of the criminal history record information pursuant to subsection D of § [19.2-390](/vacode/19.2-390/) and (ii) provide written or electronic notification to the Central Criminal Records Exchange within the Department of State Police that such offense does not appear on the offender's criminal history record.
