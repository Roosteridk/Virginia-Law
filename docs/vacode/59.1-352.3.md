A. No supplier, directly or through an officer, agent, or employee, may terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of an agreement without good cause.

B. Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, a dealer who terminates an agreement with a supplier shall notify the supplier of the termination not less than 90 days prior to the effective date of the termination.

The notice shall state all reasons constituting good cause.

D. Notification under this section shall be in writing and shall be by certified mail or personally delivered to the recipient. It shall contain all of the following:

1. A statement of intention to terminate the dealership;

2. A statement of the reasons for the termination; and

3. The date on which the termination takes effect.

E. The notice and right to cure is not required if the reason for termination, cancellation or nonrenewal is for good cause, as defined in ยง [59.1-352.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-352.1/).
