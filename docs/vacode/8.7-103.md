# § 8.7-103 Relation of title to treaty or statute.

(1) To the extent that any treaty or statute of the United States or regulatory statute of this State is applicable, the provisions of this title are subject thereto.

(2) This article does not modify or repeal any law prescribing the form or content of a document of title or the services or facilities to be afforded by a bailee, or otherwise regulating a bailee's business in respects not specifically treated in this article. However, violation of such a law does not affect the status of a document that otherwise is within the definition of a document.

(3) This Title modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. § 7001, et seq.) but does not modify, limit, or supersede Section 101(c) of that act (15 U.S.C. § 7001(c)) or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in Section 103 (b) of that act (15 U.S.C. § 7003 (b)).

(4) To the extent there is a conflict between the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (§ [59.1-479](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-479/) et seq.) and this article this article governs.
