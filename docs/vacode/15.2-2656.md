An appeal from the final judgment of the circuit court in a bond validation proceeding may be taken to the Court of Appeals. No appeal shall be allowed unless a notice of appeal is filed in the circuit court within 15 days after the date on which the final judgment of the court is entered and unless the appealing party's opening brief is filed with the Court of Appeals within 30 days after the date on which the final judgment of the court is entered. When a notice of appeal is timely and properly filed with the clerk of the circuit court, the clerk shall certify and transmit the record to the Clerk of the Court of Appeals within 30 days after the date on which the final judgment of the circuit court is entered and the Court of Appeals shall give the appeal an expedited review. Failure of the clerk to comply with this requirement shall not affect the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to consider the appeal.
