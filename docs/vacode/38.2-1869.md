A. Failure of an agent or public adjuster to complete all continuing education course or waiver requirements, pay any fee imposed by the Board, or otherwise furnish proof of compliance during the two-year period set forth in subsection B of § [38.2-1868.1](/vacode/38.2-1868.1/), or to complete the license renewal requirements set forth in § [38.2-1825.1](/vacode/38.2-1825.1/), [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), or [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/), shall result in the termination, pursuant to § [38.2-1825.1](/vacode/38.2-1825.1/), [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), or [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/), of each license held by the agent or public adjuster for which the requirements of this article were not satisfied.

B. Neither the Board, its administrator, nor the Commission shall have the power to grant an agent or public adjuster additional time for completing the continuing education credits required by § [38.2-1866](/vacode/38.2-1866/), or additional time for seeking waivers or submitting proof of compliance as required by § [38.2-1868.1](/vacode/38.2-1868.1/).

However, failure of an agent or public adjuster to provide notice of appeal in the form and manner prescribed by the Board within 30 calendar days following expiration of the two-year period set forth in subsection B of § [38.2-1868.1](/vacode/38.2-1868.1/) and in §§ [38.2-1825.1](/vacode/38.2-1825.1/), [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), and [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/) shall be deemed a waiver by such agent or public adjuster of the right to appeal the determination of noncompliance with the Board.

D. Pursuant to the requirements of subsection C of § [38.2-1815](/vacode/38.2-1815/) and §§ [38.2-1857.1](/vacode/38.2-1857.1/) and [55.1-1003](/vacode/55.1-1003/), respectively:

1. A resident variable contract agent whose life and annuities insurance agent license is terminated for failure to satisfy the requirements of this article shall also have such variable contract license terminated by the Commission;

2. A resident agent holding a license as a surplus lines broker whose property and casualty insurance agent license is terminated for failure to satisfy the requirements of this article shall also have such surplus lines broker license terminated by the Commission; and

3. An agent holding a registration as a title settlement agent whose title insurance agent license is terminated for failure to satisfy the requirements of this article shall also have such registration as a title settlement agent terminated by the Commission.

Any such license or registration so terminated may be applied for again after the agent has obtained, respectively, a new life and annuities insurance agent's license, a new property and casualty insurance agent's license, or a new title insurance agent's license and appointment, if appointment is required.

E. An insurance consultant who fails to renew his insurance consultant license by the date specified in § [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), but who reinstates his insurance consultant license within 12 months following such renewal date shall be treated, for purposes of determining exemption from continuing education requirements pursuant to § [38.2-1871](/vacode/38.2-1871/), as if such insurance consultant license had been renewed in a timely manner.

F. A resident public adjuster whose license has been terminated under the terms of this section and whose license is not reinstated pursuant to § [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/) shall be permitted to make application for a new license if all of the requirements of § [38.2-1845.2](/vacode/38.2-1845.2/) are met.
