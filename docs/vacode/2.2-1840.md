# § 2.2-1840 Blanket surety bond plan for state and local employees.

A. Subject to the approval of the Governor, the Division shall establish a program of blanket surety bonding to provide surety for the faithful performance of duty for all state employees required by statute to be bonded, and for other agency employees handling funds or having access to funds whose function, in the opinion of the agency head and the Division, should be bonded.

B. Local employees, including superintendents and jail officers of regional jail facilities as described in § [53.1-110](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-110/), local constitutional officers, and those employees of the Supreme Court for whom the Commonwealth pays all or part of the costs of surety bonds shall be required to participate in the blanket surety bond program adopted by the Division through the Comptroller and the Compensation Board. The Division shall exclude clerks of the circuit court with respect to the moneys they hold pursuant to § [8.01-582](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-582/) insofar as coverage is provided under § [2.2-1841](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1841/) for their faithful performance concerning those moneys. Before implementing the program, the Division shall determine that the program will be of less cost to the Commonwealth than the aggregate of individual bonds costs.

C. The blanket surety bonding plan for state employees shall be submitted to the Governor for approval prior to implementation.

D. Employees or officers of a public service authority created under the Virginia Water and Waste Authorities Act (§ [15.2-5100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-5100/) et seq.) may participate in the blanket surety bond program adopted by the Division through the Comptroller and the Compensation Board whenever any federal or state agency lends or guarantees funds to a public service authority created under the Virginia Water and Waste Authorities Act where the funds are utilized in the construction or capitalization of projects authorized under the Act, and there is a condition of the loan or guarantee that those employees or officers of the authority who have access to the funds be bonded. Participation by such employees or officers shall be approved by the governing body of the county or city that created the authority or is a member of the authority, with approval of the Division.
