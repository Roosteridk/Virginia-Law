# ยง 3.2-5609 Testing and inspection of weights and measures offered for sale or commercially used.

A. When not otherwise provided by law, the Commissioner shall have the power to inspect and test, to ascertain if they are correct, all weights and measures kept, offered, or exposed for sale. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to inspect and test on a periodic basis as he deems necessary, to ascertain if they are correct, all weights and measures commercially used: (i) in determining the weight, measurement, or count of commodities or things sold, or offered or exposed for sale, on the basis of weight, measure, or of count; or (ii) in computing the basic charge or payment for services rendered on the basis of weight, measure, or count. With respect to any single-service devices and any uniformly mass-produced devices, a test may be made on representative samples of such devices; and any lot of which such samples are representative shall be held to be correct or incorrect upon the basis of the results of the inspections and tests on such samples. As used in this chapter, "single-service devices" means any devices designed to be used commercially once and then discarded. "Uniformly mass-produced devices" includes any devices made by means of a mold or die, and not susceptible to individual adjustment.

B. The Commissioner shall submit a report by October 1 of each year to the Chairmen of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources on the testing and inspection activities of the Department weights and measures program including the number and frequency of inspections for the weights and measures devices.
