A. The Director is authorized to prescribe reasonable rules regarding visitation that shall include authorization of visitation by minor dependents of prisoners who are primary caretakers of minor children with Level 1 or Level 2 security classifications that include (i) opportunities for dependent children under the age of 18 to visit their incarcerated primary caretakers at least twice per week unless an employee of the Department has a reasonable belief that the child (a) may be harmed during visitation or (b) poses a security risk due to a gang affiliation, prior conviction, or past violation of a correctional facility's contraband policy; (ii) the elimination of restrictions on the number of dependent children under the age of 18 that may be permitted visitation privileges; and (iii) authorization for contact visits for prisoners who are primary caretakers of minor children.

B. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Department from refusing visitation of a minor child based on an individualized determination by the Director, warden, or superintendent that such visitation presents security or operational risks.
