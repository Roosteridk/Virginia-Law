In the event of any dispute concerning the existence of a violation, the activity alleged to be in violation shall be halted pending a determination by the Director, whose decision shall be final and binding unless reversed on judicial appeal pursuant to § [2.2-4026](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4026/). Any person who fails or refuses to halt such activity may be compelled to do so by injunction issued by a court having competent jurisdiction.
