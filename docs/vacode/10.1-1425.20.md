# ยง 10.1-1425.20 Findings and intent.

A. The General Assembly finds that:

1. The management of solid waste can pose a wide range of hazards to public health and safety and to the environment;

2. Packaging comprises a significant percentage of the overall waste stream;

3. The presence of heavy metals in packaging is a concern because of the potential presence of heavy metals in residue from manufacturers' recycling processes, in emissions or ash when packaging is incinerated, or in leachate when packaging is landfilled; and

4. Lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern.

B. It is the intent of the General Assembly to:

1. Reduce the toxicity of packaging;

2. Eliminate the addition of heavy metals to packaging; and

3. Achieve reductions in toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of recovered material in the production of products, packaging, and its components.
