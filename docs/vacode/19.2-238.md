# § 19.2-238 Summons against corporation; proceedings; expense of publication.

A summons against a corporation to answer an indictment, presentment or information may be served as provided in §§ [8.01-299](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-299/) through [8.01-301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-301/); and if the defendant after being so served fail to appear, the court may proceed to trial and judgment, without further process, as if the defendant had appeared, plead not guilty and waived trial by jury. And when, in any such case, publication of a copy of the process is required according to such sections, the expense of such publication may be certified by the court to the Comptroller, and shall be paid out of the state treasury; but the same shall be taxed with other costs and collected from the defendant, if judgment be for the Commonwealth, and be paid into the state treasury by the officer collecting the same.

Code 1950, § 19.1-186; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 495.
