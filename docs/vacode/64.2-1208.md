# § 64.2-1208 Expenses and commissions allowed fiduciaries.

A. In stating and settling the account, the commissioner of accounts shall allow the fiduciary any reasonable expenses incurred by him and, except in cases in which it is otherwise provided, a reasonable compensation in the form of a commission on receipts or otherwise. Unless otherwise provided by the court, any guardian appointed pursuant to Chapter 20 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ [64.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2100/) et seq.) shall also be allowed reasonable compensation for his services. If a committee or other fiduciary renders services with regard to real estate owned by the ward or beneficiary, compensation may also be allowed for the services rendered with regard to the real estate and the income from or the value of such real estate.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A or any provision under Chapter 7 (§ [64.2-700](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-700/) et seq.), where the compensation of an institutional fiduciary is specified under the terms of the trust or will by reference to a standard published fee schedule, the commissioner of accounts shall not reduce the compensation below the amount specified unless there is sufficient proof that (i) the settlor or testator was not competent when the trust instrument or will was executed or (ii) such compensation is excessive in light of the compensation institutional fiduciaries generally receive in similar situations.
