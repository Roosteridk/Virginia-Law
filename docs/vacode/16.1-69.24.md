From any such fine or sentence, there shall be an appeal of right within the period prescribed in this title and to the court or courts designated therein for appeals in other cases, and the proceedings on such appeal shall conform in all respects to the provisions of §§ [18.2-456](/vacode/18.2-456/) through [18.2-459](/vacode/18.2-459/).

B. Any person charged with a felony offense, misdemeanor offense, or released on a summons pursuant to § [19.2-73](/vacode/19.2-73/) or [19.2-74](/vacode/19.2-74/) who fails to appear before any court or judicial officer as required shall not be punished for contempt under this provision but may be punished for such contempt under subdivision A 6 of § [18.2-456](/vacode/18.2-456/).
