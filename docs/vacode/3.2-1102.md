If any person is delinquent in any payment of the money due or interest thereon, then the amount shall be collected by civil action in the name of the Commonwealth at the direction of the Tax Commissioner, and any person adjudged to be in default shall pay the cost of such action. The Attorney General, at the request of the Tax Commissioner, shall institute action in an appropriate court for the collection of any money due under Part B of this subtitle, including interest thereon. The Tax Commissioner may waive or remit such penalty, or portion thereof, in his discretion for good cause shown.
