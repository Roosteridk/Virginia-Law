Such request for information shall include (i) a copy of the deceased person's death certificate filed in accordance with § [32.1-263](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-263/); (ii) written authorization for the funeral service provider's submission of the request that is executed by a person designated to make arrangements for the decedent's burial or disposition of his remains pursuant to § [54.1-2825](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2825/), an agent named in an advance directive pursuant to § [54.1-2984](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2984/), a guardian appointed pursuant to Chapter 20 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) of Title 64.2 who may exercise the powers conferred in the order of appointment or by § [64.2-2019](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2019/), or the next of kin as defined in § [54.1-2800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2800/); and (iii) if the deceased person was covered or is believed to have been covered under a group life insurance policy, the affiliation of the deceased person entitling the deceased to coverage under the group life insurance policy.

B. Upon receipt of the information requested pursuant to subsection A, if the beneficiary of record under the life insurance contract or group life insurance policy is not the estate of the deceased person, the requesting funeral service provider shall make all reasonable efforts to contact all the beneficiaries of record within four calendar days of receiving such information and provide to the beneficiaries all information provided to the funeral service provider by the life insurer. The funeral service provider shall, prior to providing any information to the beneficiaries in accordance with this subsection, inform the beneficiaries that the beneficiary of a life insurance policy has no legal duty or obligation to pay any amounts associated with the provision of funeral services or the debts or obligations of the deceased person.
