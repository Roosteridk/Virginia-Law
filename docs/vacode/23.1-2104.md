# ยง 23.1-2104 Authority to establish Radford University-Roanoke Division.

A. In recognition of the fact that maintaining an innovative academic health center in Roanoke addresses the increased health care training needs in the Commonwealth, the board may establish the Radford University-Roanoke Division (the Division) through the acquisition of Jefferson College of Health Sciences, a nonprofit private institution wholly owned and operated by Carilion Clinic.

B. Upon establishment of the Division, the board may (i) exercise the same powers with respect to the operation of the Division as are vested in the board regarding the University and (ii) offer at the Division all programs of instruction offered by Jefferson College of Health Sciences at the time of acquisition, including associate-degree programs. However, the board shall cease to offer such associate-degree programs at the Division when the Council, the nationally recognized regional accreditation body, and the programmatic accreditation body approve Virginia Western Community College to offer such associate-degree programs in the Roanoke region. Nothing in this section shall authorize the University to offer any other associate-degree programs in the Roanoke region.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the University may award merit-based and need-based institutional aid to students enrolled at the Division in a manner that is consistent with practices at the former Jefferson College of Health Sciences.
