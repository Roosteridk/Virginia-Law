# § 6.2-906 Disclosure of irregularities; Commission's powers.

A. If upon the examination of any bank, the Commission ascertains that the banking laws of the Commonwealth are not being fully observed, that any irregularities are being practiced, or that the bank's capital has been or is in danger of being impaired, the Commission shall give immediate notice thereof to the officers and directors of the bank. In addition, if it is deemed necessary in order to conserve the assets of such bank or to protect the interests of depositors and creditors thereof, the Commission may do any one or more of the following:

1. Temporarily suspend the right of such bank to receive any further deposits;

2. Temporarily close such bank, for a period not exceeding 60 days, which period may be further extended for one or more 60-day periods as the Commission may deem necessary;

3. Require the officers and directors of the bank to liquidate its outstanding loans insofar as shall be required;

4. Require that any impairment of the capital stock be made good;

5. Require that any irregularities be promptly corrected;

6. Require the bank to make reports, daily or at such other times as may be required to the Commission, as to the results achieved in carrying out the orders of the Commission; and

7. Without examination, close, for such period as the Commission may deem necessary, any bank facing an emergency due to withdrawal of deposits or otherwise, or, without closing such bank, grant to it the right to suspend or limit the withdrawal of deposits, for such period as the Commission may determine.

B. If any bank fails or refuses to comply with any such order of the Commission, or if the Commission shall determine that a receiver for any such bank should be appointed, the Commission may apply for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the business affairs and assets of the bank and to wind up its affairs as provided in this chapter.
