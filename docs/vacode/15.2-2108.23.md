# § 15.2-2108.23 Regulation of rights-of-way; fees.

A. To the extent that a franchised cable operator has been authorized to use the public rights-of-way in a locality and is obligated to pay a franchise fee to such locality, such cable operator shall not be subject to any occupancy, use, or similar fee, with respect to its use of such rights-of-way, by the locality or the Commonwealth Transportation Board except to the extent that such cable operator is also a certificated provider of telecommunications services and subject to the public rights-of-way use fee under § [56-468.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-468.1/). The Commonwealth Transportation Board may charge, on a nondiscriminatory basis, fees to recover the approximate actual cost incurred for the issuance of a permit to perform work within the rights-of-way and for inspections to ensure compliance with the conditions of the permit, as such fees shall be established by regulations adopted under the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.); however, such fees may not apply to certificated providers of telecommunications services except to the extent permitted under §§ [56-458](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-458/), [56-462](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-462/), and [56-468.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-468.1/).

B. A locality may charge, on a nondiscriminatory basis, fees to recover the approximate actual cost incurred for the issuance of a permit to perform work within the rights-of-way and for inspections to ensure compliance with the conditions of the permit, as such fees existed on February 1, 1997, or as subsequently modified by ordinance; however, such fees may not apply to certificated providers of telecommunications services except to the extent permitted under §§ [56-458](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-458/), [56-462](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-462/), and [56-468.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-468.1/). The limitation as to fees charged for the use of the public rights-of-way shall not be applicable to pole attachments and conduit occupancy agreements between a franchised cable operator and a locality or its authority or commission, which permits such operator to use the public poles or conduits.

C. Except as provided in §§ [56-458](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-458/), [56-462](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-462/), and [56-468.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-468.1/) and in any rules adopted by the Commonwealth Transportation Board under Article 2 (§ [33.2-208](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-208/) et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 33.2, the cable franchise granted hereunder supersedes and replaces any and all other requirements and fees in local laws and the laws of the Commonwealth relating to the use of the public rights-of-way by a cable system or other facilities for the provision of cable service, whether such other authorizations are designated as franchises, permits, consents, ordinances, or otherwise. No cable operator that is (i) a certificated provider of telecommunications services that has previous consent to use the public rights-of-way in a locality through a franchise or (ii) a certificated provider of telecommunications services that lacked prior consent to provide cable service in a locality but provided telecommunications service over facilities leased from an entity having previous consent to use the public rights-of-way in such locality through a franchise and granted a franchise and paying fees pursuant to this section shall be required, in order to develop or operate a cable system or other facilities to provide video services, to (a) obtain consent in accordance with §§ [15.2-2015](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2015/) through [15.2-2017](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2017/), § [56-458](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-458/) or [56-462](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-462/), except for permits or other permission to open streets and roads, or (b) submit bids, bonds or applications in accordance with §§ [15.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2100/) through [15.2-2105](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2105/), except for reasonable performance bonds or letters of credit not in excess of $50,000. The restrictions in §§ [15.2-2015](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2015/) through [15.2-2018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2018/), [15.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2100/) through [15.2-2105](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2105/), [15.2-2106](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2106/) and [15.2-2107](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2107/), including but not limited to the advertisement and receipt of bids for franchises, shall not apply to a cable system or other facilities used to provide cable services by a cable operator that is a certificated provider of telecommunications services with previous consent to use the public rights-of-way in a locality through a franchise, including the provision of telecommunications services over facilities leased from an entity with previous consent to use the public rights-of-way in a locality through a franchise, but without previous consent to provide cable service in that locality.
