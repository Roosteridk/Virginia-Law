# ยง 38.2-1337 Disclaimer of control.

1. A domestic insurer may acquire voting securities of any company in an amount sufficient to presume control without the company's being considered a subsidiary if the domestic insurer files a disclaimer of affiliation with the Commission. The disclaimer shall disclose fully (i) the nature and purpose of the investment, (ii) all material transactions and relationships between the domestic insurer and the company, and (iii) the basis for the disclaimer. The Commission may disallow the disclaimer only after giving the domestic insurer and the company notice and an opportunity to be heard. Any disallowance shall be supported by specific findings of fact.

2. If the Commission disallows the disclaimer, the domestic insurer shall immediately take action sufficient to satisfy the Commission that the domestic insurer does not control the company.
