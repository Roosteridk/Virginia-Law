# § 22.1-296 Payment of employees; reimbursement for private transportation; certain sick leave policies.

A. Each school board shall provide for the payment of teachers, principals, assistant principals, and other employees monthly, semimonthly, or biweekly, as may be determined by the school board.

However, school boards setting the school calendar so that the first day students are required to attend occurs prior to August 15 shall establish a payment schedule to ensure that all contract personnel are compensated for time worked within the first month of employment.

C. Each local school board shall adopt policies providing for leave without pay for school board employees with debilitating or life-threatening illness or injury, without regard to the employee's length of service with the school board.
