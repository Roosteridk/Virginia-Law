A. Except as otherwise provided in subsections B and C, any complaint against the holder of a Virginia license for any violation of statutes or regulations pertaining to the Board or any of the programs that may be in another title of the Code for which the Board has enforcement responsibility, in order to be investigated by the Board, shall be made in writing, or otherwise made in accordance with Board procedures, and received by the Board within three years of the act, omission, or occurrence giving rise to the violation.

B. However, where a holder of a Virginia license has materially and willfully misrepresented, concealed, or omitted any information and the information so misrepresented, concealed, or omitted is material to the establishment of the violation, the complaint may be made at any time within two years after discovery of the misrepresentation, concealment, or omission.

C. In cases where criminal charges have been filed involving matters that, if found to be true, would also constitute a violation of the regulations or laws of the regulant's profession enforced by the Board, an investigation may be initiated by the Board at any time within two years following the date such criminal charges are filed.

D. In order to be investigated by the Board, any complaint against an individual using the CPA title in Virginia under the substantial equivalency provisions of ยง [54.1-4411](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-4411/) or against a firm providing attest services, compilation services, or financial statement preparation services under subsection C of ยง 54.4412.1 for any violation of statutes or regulations pertaining to the Board or any of the programs that may be in another title of this Code for which the Board has enforcement responsibility shall be made in writing, or otherwise made in accordance with Board procedures, and received by the Board within five years of the act, omission, or occurrence giving rise to the violation.

E. Public information obtained from any source may serve as the basis for a written complaint. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the filing of a complaint if the alleged violation of the statute or regulation is discovered during an investigation authorized by law, and the acts, omissions, or conditions constituting the alleged violations are witnessed by a sworn investigator appointed by the Executive Director.

F. Nothing herein shall deny the right of any party to bring a civil cause of action in a court of law.
