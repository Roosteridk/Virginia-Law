A. Concession payments to the Commonwealth deposited into the Transportation Trust Fund pursuant to subdivision B 2 of § [33.2-1524](/vacode/33.2-1524/) from qualifying transportation facilities developed and/or operated pursuant to the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995 (§ [33.2-1800](/vacode/33.2-1800/) et seq.) shall be held in a separate subaccount to be designated the Concession Payments Account, (the Account) together with all interest, dividends, and appreciation that accrue to the Account and that are not otherwise specifically directed by law or reserved by the Board for other purposes allowed by law.

B. The Board may make allocations from the Account upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the Board deems appropriate to:

1. Pay or finance all or part of the costs of programs or projects, including the costs of planning, operation, maintenance, and improvements incurred in connection with the acquisition and construction of projects, provided that allocations from the Account shall be limited to programs and projects that are reasonably related to or benefit the users of the qualifying transportation facility that was the subject of a concession pursuant to the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995 (§ [33.2-1800](/vacode/33.2-1800/) et seq.). The priorities of metropolitan planning organizations, planning district commissions, local governments, and transportation corridors shall be considered by the Board in making project allocations from moneys in the Account.

2. Repay funds from the Toll Facilities Revolving Account or the Transportation Partnership Opportunity Fund.

3. Pay the Board's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the administration and management of the Account.

C. Concession payments to the Commonwealth for a qualifying transportation facility located within the boundaries of a rapid rail project for which a federal Record of Decision has been issued shall be held in a subaccount separate from the Concession Payments Account together with all interest, dividends, and appreciation that accrue to the subaccount. The Board may make allocations from the subaccount as the Board deems appropriate to:

1. Pay or finance all or part of the costs of planning, design, land acquisition, and improvements incurred in connection with the construction of such rapid rail project consistent with the issued federal Record of Decision, as may be revised; and

2. Upon determination by the Board that sufficient funds are or will be available to meet the schedule for construction of such rapid rail project, pay or finance all or part of the costs of planning, design, land acquisition, and improvements incurred in connection with other highway and public transportation projects within the corridor of the rapid rail project or within the boundaries of the qualifying transportation facility. In the case of highway projects, the Board shall follow an approval process generally in accordance with subsection B of § [33.2-208](/vacode/33.2-208/).

D. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to the end that its beneficial purposes may be effectuated. Insofar as this provision is inconsistent with the provisions of any other general, special, or local law, this provision shall be controlling.
