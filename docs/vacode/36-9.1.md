# § 36-9.1 Exemptions from applicability of this chapter; conflicts in provisions of law.

This chapter shall not be applicable to farm structures as defined in § [36-3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-3/) unless they are within the purview of the Uniform Statewide Building Code, as provided in § [36-99](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-99/). Further, the creation of a redevelopment or conservation area, or designation of an individual structure as blighted pursuant to § [36-49.1:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-49.1:1/), under the process for determination of spot blight, shall not abrogate the right to farm as protected in Chapter 3 (§ [3.2-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-300/) et seq.) of Title 3.2. If there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and § [3.2-302](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-302/), the provisions of § [3.2-302](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-302/) shall control. If there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and § [25.1-106](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-106/), the provisions of § [25.1-106](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-106/) shall control. However, nothing herein shall be construed to preclude enforcement of local, state or federal criminal laws with respect to criminal activities occurring on a property where one or more farm structures are located.
