# ยง 23.1-509.1 Alternative tuition or fee structures.

Any public institution of higher education may offer alternative tuition or fee structures to students that result in lower costs of attendance, including discounted tuition, flat tuition rates, discounted student fees, or student fee and student services flexibility, to any first-time, incoming freshman undergraduate student who (i) has established domicile, as that term is defined in ยง [23.1-500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-500/), in the Commonwealth and (ii) enrolls full time with the intent to earn a degree in a program that leads to employment in a high-demand field in the region. Such an alternative tuition or fee structure may be renewed each year if the recipient maintains eligibility for the alternative tuition and fee structure. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shall offer guidance, upon request, to any public institution of higher education in establishing an alternative tuition or fee structure pursuant to this section.
