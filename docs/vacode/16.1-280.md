# § 16.1-280 Commitment of juveniles with mental illness or intellectual disability.

When any juvenile court has found a juvenile to be in need of services or delinquent pursuant to the provisions of this law and reasonably believes such juvenile has mental illness or intellectual disability, the court may commit him to an appropriate hospital or order mandatory outpatient treatment in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 (§ [16.1-335](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-335/) et seq.) or admit him to a training center in accordance with the provisions of § [37.2-806](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-806/) for observation as to his mental condition. No juvenile shall be committed pursuant to this section or Article 16 (§ [16.1-335](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-335/) et seq.) to a maximum security unit within any state hospital where adults determined to be criminally insane reside. However, the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services may place a juvenile who has been certified to the circuit court for trial as an adult pursuant to § [16.1-269.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-269.6/) or [16.1-270](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-270/) or who has been convicted as an adult of a felony in the circuit court in a unit appropriate for the care and treatment of persons under a criminal charge when, in his discretion, such placement is necessary to protect the security or safety of other patients, staff, or the public. The Commissioner shall notify the committing court of any placement in such unit. The committing court shall review the placement at 30-day intervals.
