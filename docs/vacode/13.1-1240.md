# § 13.1-1240 Dissolution of series.

A. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the articles of trust or in the governing instrument of the business trust, a series established in accordance with § [13.1-1219](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1219/) may be dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the business trust or any other series. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of trust or in the governing instrument of the business trust, the dissolution, winding up, liquidation or termination of the business trust or any series thereof shall not affect the limitation of liability with respect to a series established in accordance with §§ [13.1-1219](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1219/) and [13.1-1231](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1231/). A series established in accordance with § [13.1-1219](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1219/) is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up at the time or upon the happening of events specified in the governing instrument of the business trust. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the articles of trust or in the governing instrument of a business trust, the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a beneficial owner of such series shall not result in the termination or dissolution of such series and such series may not be terminated or revoked by a beneficial owner of such series or other person except in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument of the business trust.

B. Upon dissolution of a series of a business trust, the persons who under the governing instrument of the business trust are responsible for winding up such series' affairs may, in the name of the business trust and for and on behalf of the business trust and such series, take all actions with respect to the series as are permitted under § [13.1-1236](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1236/) and shall provide for the claims and obligations of the series and distribute the assets of the series as provided under § [13.1-1237](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1237/). Any person, including any trustee, who under the governing instrument is responsible for winding up such series' affairs and who has complied with § [13.1-1237](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1237/) shall not be personally liable to the claimants of the dissolved series by reason of such person's actions in winding up the series.
