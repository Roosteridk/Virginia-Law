Any city formed under the provisions of this chapter may, by ordinance, elect to continue receiving, for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the granting of a city charter, the full services of the Department of Transportation in the same manner and to the same extent such services were rendered prior to such city being formed. Upon the passage of such ordinance, funds for the maintenance, construction or reconstruction of streets within the areas formerly a county shall continue to be allocated as if such areas were still in a county and the city shall not receive funds for maintenance, construction or reconstruction of streets in those areas during the period the Department of Transportation furnishes such services. In those areas where the Department provides the above services, the governing body of the city shall have control over the streets and highways to the same extent as was formerly vested in the governing body of the county. At any time prior to the expiration of the ten-year period, the governing body may elect, by ordinance, to place its streets, or a portion of them, in the urban system of highways and shall receive funds as provided by law for all cities.
