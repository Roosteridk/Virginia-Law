Each clinical reviewer's opinion shall be in writing and include the following information: a description of the covered person's medical condition; a description of the indicators relevant to determining whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be more beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care services or treatments and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments; a description and analysis of any medical or scientific evidence considered in reaching the opinion; a description and analysis of any evidence-based standard; and information on the extent, if any, to which the reviewer's rationale for the opinion regarding the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is based on (i) whether the health care service or treatment has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for the condition or (ii) medical or scientific evidence or evidence-based standards that demonstrate the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be more beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care service or treatment and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments.

L. Within 20 days after the date it receives an opinion from all clinical reviewers, the assigned independent review organization shall make a decision and provide written notice to the covered person, his authorized representative, if any, the health carrier, and the Commission. If:
