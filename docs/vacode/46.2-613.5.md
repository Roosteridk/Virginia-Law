# ยง 46.2-613.5 Procedures for issuing and serving process in civil penalty cases.

Any size and weight compliance agent authorized to enforce the provisions of ยง [46.2-613.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-613.1/) may issue a citation for a violation of such provisions. Such size and weight compliance agent may also serve an attachment summons issued by a judge or magistrate in connection with a violation of ยง [46.2-613.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-613.1/).

Service of any such citation shall be made upon the driver of the motor vehicle involved in the violation. Such service on the driver shall have the same legal force and validity as if served within the Commonwealth personally upon the owner, operator, or other person charged with the violation, whether such owner, operator, or other person charged is a resident or nonresident.
