# § 65.2-309.1 Creation of lien and subrogation of employer to employee's rights to recover uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to insurance coverage carried by and at the expense of employer.

A. A claim against an employer under this title for injury or death benefits shall create a lien and right of subrogation on behalf of the employer, as set forth in § [65.2-309](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-309/), against proceeds recovered by the injured employee pursuant to the uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions of a policy of motor vehicle insurance carried by and at the expense of the employer. In any action by an employee against any person other than the employer, the court shall, after reasonable notice to the parties and the employer, ascertain the amount of compensation paid and expenses for medical, surgical and hospital attention and supplies, and funeral expenses incurred by the employer under the provisions of this title and deduct therefrom a proportionate share of such amounts as are paid by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses and attorney's fees as provided in § [65.2-311](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-311/); and, in the event of judgment against such person other than the employer, the court shall, in its order, require that the judgment debtor pay such compensation and expenses of the employer, less said share of expenses and attorney's fees, so ascertained by the court out of the amount of the judgment, so far as sufficient, and the balance, if any, to the judgment creditor.

B. If an injured employee is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under more than one policy, the order of priority shall be as provided by subsection B of § [38.2-2206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2206/).
