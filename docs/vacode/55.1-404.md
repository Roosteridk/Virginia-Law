The court may set aside a fraudulent conveyance or voluntary transfer pursuant to ยง [55.1-400](/vacode/55.1-400/) or [55.1-401](/vacode/55.1-401/) during an action brought by a creditor to execute on a judgment, either on motion of the creditor or on its own motion, provided that all parties who have an interest in the property subject to the conveyance or transfer are given notice of the proceeding.
