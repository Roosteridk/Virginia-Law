# ยง 58.1-3138 Delivery of books, tax tickets, and other materials to successor treasurer or court clerk.

Whenever a vacancy in the office of treasurer is filled by appointment, the court or judge making the appointment shall, at the time the appointment is made, if the vacancy exists by reason of the death, resignation or removal from office of the treasurer, order such treasurer or his personal representative, as the case may be, to deliver all books and papers in his possession as treasurer, including all tax tickets for taxes and levies for the current year for which he has not accounted and paid into the treasury, to the officer so appointed. The appointed officer shall prepare and issue a receipt to such treasurer or his personal representative for the material received. When no appointment is made or the officer appointed fails to qualify, the court shall order the deposit of such materials to be made with the clerk of the circuit court, who shall give a receipt therefor and hold such materials subject to the order of the court.

When the term of office of a treasurer expires by limitation he shall deliver forthwith to his successor in office all the books and papers in his possession, including all tax tickets for taxes and levies for the current year for which he has not accounted and paid into the treasury, and take a receipt therefor. The receipt so furnished to any treasurer or his representative shall be allowed as a credit for the amount thereof in the settlement of his account and the amount of tax tickets and levies covered by such receipt shall be charged against his successor in office.
