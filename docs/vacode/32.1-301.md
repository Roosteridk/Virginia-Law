# ยง 32.1-301 Burial, cremation, or return of bodies after scientific study.

After the bodies distributed pursuant to ยง [32.1-299](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-299/) have been used for the purpose of instruction, they shall be decently interred or cremated by the institution or individual receiving them. However, if the decedent has stipulated in writing before his death that the cremated remains of his body, lawfully donated for scientific study, shall be returned to relatives for disposition after scientific study has been completed, or if the decedent's next of kin, who lawfully donated the body for scientific study, requests in writing at the time of donation that the decedent's cremated remains be returned to relatives after scientific study has been completed, the institution or individual that received the body shall return the decedent's cremated remains to his next of kin or relatives. Any such writing shall acknowledge the responsibility to maintain the current name, address, and telephone number of the relatives to whom the decedent's cremated remains are to be returned.

The written request of the decedent's next of kin shall include the name of the next of kin, the current address to which the cremated remains shall be delivered, and the current telephone number of the next of kin or relatives where they may be contacted. The costs of transporting and delivering the cremated remains shall be borne by the institution or individual receiving the body. The institution or individual that received the decedent's body and who has received such a written request shall not be obligated to return the decedent's cremated remains if the name, address, and telephone number of the next of kin or relatives have not been provided in such written request or are no longer current.
