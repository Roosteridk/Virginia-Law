# ยง 3.2-3615 Plant food deficiency.

A. The Commissioner shall calculate assessments for a deficiency of: (i) total nitrogen (N); (ii) available phosphate (P205); or (iii) soluble potash (K20). If the analysis shows that the fertilizer is deficient: (a) in one or more of the guaranteed primary plant nutrients, beyond the investigational allowances and compensations, as established by regulation; or (b) that the overall index value of the fertilizer is below the level established by regulation, then an assessment for variance from guarantee of two times the value of such deficiency, not to exceed $5,000 per occurrence, shall be paid to the consumer by the guarantor. When the fertilizer is subject to an assessment under both clauses (a) and (b), the Commissioner shall calculate assessments under both such clauses and the guarantor shall pay to the consumer the larger of the two assessments.

B. If, upon evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner, a person is found to have: (i) altered the content of any fertilizer shipped to him by a licensee; or (ii) mixed, or commingled, fertilizer from two or more distributors, such that the result of either alteration changes the analysis of the fertilizer as originally guaranteed, then the person who has altered, mixed or commingled shall: (a) obtain a license and register the altered or mixed product; (b) be held liable for all assessments; and (c) be subject to other provisions of this chapter including seizure, condemnation, and stop sale.

C. A deficiency in an official sample of mixed fertilizer, resulting from nonuniformity, is not distinguishable from a deficiency due to actual plant nutrient shortage, and any deficiency due to nonuniformity shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
