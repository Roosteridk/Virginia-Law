Any public entity may dedicate any property interest that it has for public use as a qualified transportation facility if it finds that so doing will serve the public purpose of this chapter. In connection with such dedication, a public entity may convey any property interest that it has, subject to the conditions imposed by general law governing such conveyances, to the private entity, subject to the provisions of this chapter, for such consideration as such public entity may determine. The aforementioned consideration may include the agreement of the private entity to develop and/or operate the qualifying transportation facility. The property interests that the public entity may convey to the private entity in connection with a dedication under this section may include licenses, franchises, easements, concessions, or any other right or interest the public entity deems appropriate. Such property interest including a leasehold interest in and/or rights to use real property constituting a qualifying transportation facility shall be considered property indirectly owned by a government if described in ยง [58.1-3606.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3606.1/).
