On real estate, it may be levied by such estate being mentioned and described in an endorsement on the attachment by the officer to whom it is delivered for service to the following effect:

"Levied on the following real estate of the defendant A. (or defendants A.

day of..........................… at..........… o'clock. E.F., sheriff   
(or other officer),"

and by service of the attachment on the person, if any, in possession of such real estate.
