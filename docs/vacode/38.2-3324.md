# § 38.2-3324 Standard provisions required; exceptions.

A. No group life insurance policy shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth unless it contains in substance the standard provisions prescribed in this article. The standard provisions required for individual life insurance policies shall not apply to group life insurance policies.

B. If a group life insurance policy is not term insurance, it shall contain a nonforfeiture provision that in the opinion of the Commission is equitable to the insured persons and to the policyholder. This subsection shall not be construed to require that group life insurance policies contain the same nonforfeiture provisions as are required for individual life insurance policies.

C. The provisions of § [38.2-3330](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3330/), subsection A of § [38.2-3331](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3331/), and §§ [38.2-3332](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3332/) through [38.2-3334](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3334/) shall not apply to policies issued pursuant to § [38.2-3318.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3318.1/) B or group life insurance contracts in which the insurable interest is as described in subdivision 3 of subsection B of § [38.2-301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-301/).
