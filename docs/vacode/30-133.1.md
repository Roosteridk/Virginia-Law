# ยง 30-133.1 Additional certifications for public institutions of higher education.

In addition to all other responsibilities and duties required under law, the Auditor of Public Accounts shall, promptly upon completion of the annual audit for each public institution of higher education, certify in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Visitors or other governing body of the institution, the Secretaries of Education, Finance, and Administration, and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations whether or not the institution meets all of the financial and administrative management standards currently in effect for public institutions of higher education pursuant to ยง [23.1-1001](/vacode/23.1-1001/) and as may be included in the appropriation act currently in effect. In addition, for any public institution of higher education required to develop and implement a plan of corrective action under ยง [23.1-1001](/vacode/23.1-1001/), the Auditor shall at the time of making the certification provide a written evaluation of the institution's progress in implementation of the plan and in meeting all of the financial and administrative management standards currently in effect.

For purposes of this section "public institution of higher education" means the same as that term is defined in ยง [23.1-100](/vacode/23.1-100/).
