# § 15.2-540 Officers and employees to receive regular compensation; fee system abolished; collection and disposition of fees.

All county officers and employees shall be paid regular compensation and the fee system as a method of compensation in the county shall be abolished, except for those officers not affected by the adoption of this form of county organization and government. All such officers and employees shall, however, continue to collect all fees and charges provided for by general law, shall keep a record thereof, and shall promptly transmit all such fees and charges collected to the director of finance, who shall promptly provide receipt therefor. Such officers shall also keep such other records as are required by § [17.1-283](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-283/). All fees and commissions, which, but for this section, would be paid to such officers by the Commonwealth for services rendered shall be paid into the county treasury.

Any excess of the fees collected by each of the officers mentioned in § [17.1-283](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-283/) or collected by anyone exercising the powers of and performing the duties of any such officer, over (i) the allowance to which such officer would be entitled by general law but for the provisions of this section and (ii) expenses in such amount as allowed by the Compensation Board, shall be paid one third into the state treasury and two thirds to the county.

Any county officer or employee who fails or refuses to collect any fee which is collectible and should be collected under the provisions of this section, or who fails or refuses to pay any fee so collected to the county as herein provided, shall upon conviction be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

Code 1950, § 15-302; 1962, c. 623, § 15.1-619; 1997, c. 587.
