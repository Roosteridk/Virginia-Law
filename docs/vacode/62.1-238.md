E. Perform other acts, including the conveyance of, or the granting of liens on or security interests in, real and personal property, together with all rights, title and interest therein, to the Fund, or take other actions as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the Authority to secure payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the loan or loan subsidy from the Fund and to provide for the remedies of the Fund in the event of any default in the payment of the loan or loan subsidy, including, without limitation, any of the following:

The combination of one or more projects, or the combination of one or more projects with one or more other undertakings, facilities, utilities or systems, for the purpose of operations and financing, and the pledging of the revenues from such combined projects, undertakings, facilities, utilities and systems to secure the loan or loan subsidy from the Fund made in connection with such combination or any part or parts thereof;

3. The maintenance, replacement, renewal and repair of the project; and

4. The procurement of casualty and liability insurance.

All local governments or other entities borrowing money from the Fund are authorized to perform any acts, take any action, adopt any proceedings and make and carry out any contracts that are contemplated by this chapter. Such contracts need not be identical among all local governments or other entities, but may be structured as determined by the Authority according to the needs of the contracting local governments or other entities and the Fund.

Subject to the rights, if any, of the registered owners of any of the bonds of the Authority, the Authority may consent to and approve any modification in the terms of any loan or loan subsidy subject to guidelines adopted by the Board.
