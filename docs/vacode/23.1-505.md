B. Notwithstanding § [23.1-502](/vacode/23.1-502/) or any other provision of law to the contrary, all dependents, as defined by 37 U.S.C. § 401, of active duty military personnel or activated or temporarily mobilized reservists or guard members (i) assigned to a permanent duty station or workplace in the Commonwealth, the District of Columbia, or a state contiguous to the Commonwealth who reside in the Commonwealth; (ii) assigned unaccompanied orders and immediately prior to receiving such unaccompanied orders were assigned to a permanent duty station or workplace in the Commonwealth, the District of Columbia, or a state contiguous to the Commonwealth and resided in the Commonwealth; or (iii) assigned unaccompanied orders with the Commonwealth listed as the designated place move shall be deemed to be domiciled in the Commonwealth and are eligible to receive in-state tuition.

C. All such dependents shall be afforded the same educational benefits as any other individual who is eligible for in-state tuition pursuant to § [23.1-502](/vacode/23.1-502/). Such dependents are eligible for such benefits, including in-state tuition status, for as long as they are continuously enrolled in a public institution of higher education or private institution of higher education or have transferred between public institutions of higher education or private institutions of higher education or from an undergraduate degree program to a graduate degree program at a public institution of higher education or private institution of higher education, regardless of any change of duty station or residence of the military service member. Such continuous enrollment requirement shall be waived if the dependent verifies that a break of no longer than one year was required in order to support a spouse or parent on orders for a change of duty assignment or location.
