# ยง 16.1-296.2 Appeals of certain custody and visitation proceedings.

A. In any matter in which a filing fee either was or could have been assessed pursuant to ยง [16.1-69.48:5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-69.48:5/), no appeal shall be allowed unless and until the party applying for appeal shall, within 10 days from the entry of the final judgment or order, either (i) pay to the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken the amount of the writ tax of the court to which the appeal is taken and all other applicable costs or (ii) file with the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken a petition to have the court to which the appeal is taken determine that the writ tax and costs need not be paid on account of poverty as provided in ยง [17.1-606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-606/). The judge or clerk of any court from which the appeal is taken shall promptly transmit to the clerk of the appellate court the original pleadings, together with all exhibits and other papers filed in the trial of the case, and either (i) the writ tax and costs paid or (ii) a petition filed to have the court to which the appeal is taken determine that the writ tax and costs need not be paid on account of poverty as provided in ยง [17.1-606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-606/). Upon receipt of the foregoing by the clerk of the appellate court, the case shall then be docketed.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the writ tax of the court to which the appeal is taken and other applicable costs shall be assessed only once for all custody and visitation petitions simultaneously appealed by a single appellant.
