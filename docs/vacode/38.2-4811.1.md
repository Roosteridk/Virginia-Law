A. The Commission may license pursuant to § [38.2-1024](/vacode/38.2-1024/) an insurer domiciled in the Commonwealth as a domestic surplus lines insurer if all of the following are satisfied:

1. The insurer possesses a policyholder surplus of at least $15 million; and

2. The board of directors of the insurer has passed a resolution seeking to be a domestic surplus lines insurer in the Commonwealth.

B. For the purposes of the federal Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (15 U.S.C. § 8201 et seq.), a domestic surplus lines insurer shall be considered a nonadmitted insurer as the term is referenced in such Act, with respect to risks insured in the Commonwealth.

C. A domestic surplus lines insurer is only authorized to write the types of insurance in the Commonwealth that a surplus lines broker may procure with a nonadmitted insurer approved by the Commission pursuant to § [38.2-4811](/vacode/38.2-4811/).

D. A domestic surplus lines insurer may only write surplus lines insurance in the Commonwealth where placed by a surplus lines broker pursuant to Chapter 48 (§ [38.2-4805.1](/vacode/38.2-4805.1/) et seq.).

E. Notwithstanding any other statute, the policies issued by a domestic surplus lines insurer where the Commonwealth is the home state of the insured shall be subject to taxes and maintenance assessments levied upon surplus lines policies issued by eligible nonadmitted insurers pursuant to §§ [38.2-4809](/vacode/38.2-4809/) and [38.2-4809.1](/vacode/38.2-4809.1/) but shall not be subject to other taxes levied upon admitted insurers, whether domestic or foreign, pursuant to Chapter 25 (§ [58.1-2500](/vacode/58.1-2500/) et seq.) of Title 58.1.

F. Policies issued by a domestic surplus lines insurer are not subject to protections of or other provisions of the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association established under Chapter 16 (§ [38.2-1600](/vacode/38.2-1600/) et seq.).

G. All financial and solvency requirements imposed by the Commonwealth's law upon domestic admitted insurers shall apply to domestic surplus lines insurers unless domestic surplus lines insurers are otherwise specifically exempted. For the purposes of handling the rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of a domestic surplus lines insurer, the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ [38.2-1500](/vacode/38.2-1500/) et seq.) shall apply.

H. Policies issued by a domestic surplus lines insurer shall be exempt from all statutory requirements relating to insurance rating plans, policy forms, policy cancellation and nonrenewal, and premium charged to the insured in the same manner and to the same extent as a nonadmitted insurer domiciled in another state.
