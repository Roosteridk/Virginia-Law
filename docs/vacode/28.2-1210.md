A. Whenever any wharf, pier, piling, bulkhead, structure, or vessel is found in or upon the bays, oceans, rivers, streams or creeks of the Commonwealth in a state of abandonment, in danger of sinking, or in such disrepair as to constitute a hazard or obstruction to the use of such waterway, the Commission may ascertain the owner of the property and require him to repair or remove the property from the waters of the Commonwealth. If the identity or location of the owner remains unknown and unascertainable after a diligent search and the posting of proper notice at the last known address of the owner, if known, the Commission may have the property removed from the waterways of the Commonwealth after giving notice by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where such property is located.

Upon the occurrence of a natural disaster or other act of God, the Commission or law-enforcement official shall not issue a notification until sixty days following such occurrence. Any person who violates this subsection is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
