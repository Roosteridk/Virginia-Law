# ยง 23.1-2424 Existing bonds.

The Authority may assume or agree to make payments in amounts sufficient for the University to pay some or all of the hospital obligations incurred under resolutions previously adopted by the University with respect to the hospital facilities and may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under such resolutions or refinance such payment obligations. If the Authority assumes all hospital obligations under any such bond resolution and operates substantially all of the hospital facilities financed or refinanced by such bond resolution, the University, State Treasurer, Virginia Public Building Authority, and Virginia College Building Authority shall take such steps as are appropriate to provide for the substitution of the Authority for the University under such resolution and transfer to the Authority any funds payable to the University under the terms of such resolution.
