# ยง 50-73.114 Dissociated partner's liability to other persons.

A. A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection B.

B. A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership, or a surviving partnership under Article 9, within one year after the partner's dissociation, only if the obligation is one for which he would be liable under ยง [50-73.96](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.96/) if he were a partner and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

1. Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

2. Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

3. Is not deemed to have had knowledge under subsection E of ยง [50-73.93](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.93/) or notice under subsection C of ยง [50-73.115](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.115/).

C. By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.

D. A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
