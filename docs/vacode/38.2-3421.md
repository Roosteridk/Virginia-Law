# ยง 38.2-3421 How to show jurisdiction of other state agency or federal government.

A person may show that it is regulated by another agency of this Commonwealth, any subdivision of this Commonwealth, or the federal government by providing to the Commission the appropriate certificate, license or other document issued by the other governmental agency that permits or qualifies it to provide those services set forth in ยง [38.2-3420](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3420/). Provided, however, in lieu of such certificate, license or other documentation, the Commission may determine that such person is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission if the Commission is otherwise satisfied that such person is regulated by another agency of this Commonwealth, any subdivision of this Commonwealth or the federal government relating to the offering or providing of coverage for health care services. Any person who has provided such certificate, license, or other document shall immediately notify the Commission if such person ceases to be regulated by the governmental agency as stated in the certificate, license, or other document provided to the Commission. Any other person who is otherwise determined by the Commission not to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall also notify the Commission of any change in its circumstances which may materially affect such determination of the Commission.
