The designated employee shall not be required to take an examination if the Class A contractor changes his form of business entity and is in good standing with the Board. Upon his leaving the employ of the contractor or his leaving as a member of the contractor's responsible management, the contractor shall name another full-time employee or member of the contractor's responsible management in accordance with § [54.1-1106](/vacode/54.1-1106/).

The designated employee shall not be required to take an examination if the Class B contractor changes his form of business entity and is in good standing with the Board. If such employee leaves the employ of the contractor, the contractor shall name another full-time employee in accordance with § [54.1-1108](/vacode/54.1-1108/).

B. 1. The Board is directed to revise Board regulations to allow multiple individuals from a single firm to sit for the business examination required to be confirmed as the firm's designated employee. The Board shall also review current regulations and procedures pertaining to the time allowed for a change of the designated employee to determine if the current time for replacement is sufficient and practicable.
