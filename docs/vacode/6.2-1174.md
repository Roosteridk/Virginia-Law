# § 6.2-1174 Accounts of deceased or incompetent persons.

A. A savings institution may pay funds held in the account of a deceased person or a person under disability to the personal representative, committee, conservator, guardian, or curator of such person upon proper proof of the appointment and qualification of such fiduciary. Any savings institution making such payment shall not thereafter be liable for the amount thereof to any person. The presentation of a duly certified letter or certificate of qualification as personal representative or other fiduciary shall be conclusive proof of the jurisdiction of the court issuing the same.

B. A savings institution that has not received written notice and is not on actual notice that an account owner is deceased or has been adjudicated incompetent may pay or deliver funds held in such person's account in accordance with the provisions of the account contract without liability to any person for the amounts so paid or delivered.
