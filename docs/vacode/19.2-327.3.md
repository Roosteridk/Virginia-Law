A copy of any test results shall be filed with the petition. The petition shall be filed on a form provided by the Supreme Court. If the petitioner fails to submit a completed form, the Court may dismiss the petition or return the petition to the prisoner pending the completion of such form.

The Attorney General shall have 30 days after receipt of the record by the clerk of the Supreme Court in which to file a response to the petition.
