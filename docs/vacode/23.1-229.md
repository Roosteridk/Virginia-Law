# ยง 23.1-229 Postsecondary school closure procedures.

A. Each postsecondary school shall notify the Council of its intention to close at least 30 days prior to the closure. The notice shall be accompanied by a comprehensive plan for closure and a teachout plan that makes provision for presently enrolled students to complete the program of instruction for which they have enrolled, either at such postsecondary school or at another postsecondary school certified by the Council or authorized to operate in the Commonwealth. Each closing postsecondary school shall obtain the Council's approval of the teachout plan prior to implementation.

B. Each closing postsecondary school shall notify the Council, in writing, if there is no comparable program for the purposes of developing a teachout plan within 50 miles of the closing postsecondary school or if the closing postsecondary school is unable to enter a teachout agreement with another postsecondary school. This information shall be provided at the time the closing postsecondary school notifies the Council of its intention to close.

C. Owners or senior administrators of a postsecondary school that closes without providing (i) an adequate teachout plan or refunds of unearned tuition and (ii) appropriate preservation of records shall be denied certification to operate another postsecondary school in the Commonwealth.
