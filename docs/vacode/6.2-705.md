# § 6.2-705 Investigation of application.

A. For 60 days following receipt of a complete application with the required information, fee, and consent as provided in subsection A of § [6.2-704](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-704/), the Commission may conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether:

1. The proposed acquisition would be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the applicant or of the Virginia financial institution or Virginia financial institution holding company that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired;

2. The applicant, its directors and officers, if applicable, and any proposed new directors and officers of the Virginia financial institution or Virginia financial institution holding company that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired, are qualified by character, experience, and financial responsibility to control and operate a Virginia financial institution;

3. The proposed acquisition would be prejudicial to the interests of the depositors, creditors, beneficiaries of fiduciary accounts, or shareholders of the applicant or of the Virginia financial institution holding company or any Virginia financial institution that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired; and

4. The acquisition is in the public interest.

B. The 60-day investigation period may be:

1. Shortened or waived by the Commission, as it deems appropriate, if the Commission finds that it must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of a Virginia financial institution involved; or

2. Extended only if the Commission determines that the applicant has not furnished all the information required by subsection A of § [6.2-704](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-704/) or that the information submitted is substantially inaccurate or misleading.

C. Within the prescribed investigation period, and upon request of the applicant or the Virginia financial institution or Virginia financial institution holding company that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired, the Commission may order a hearing concerning the proposed acquisition.

D. Within the prescribed investigation period, the Commission, by giving written notice of its decision and the reasons therefor to the applicant and to the Virginia financial institution or Virginia financial institution holding company that the applicant seeks to control or the stock of which is to be acquired, may (i) disapprove the application or (ii) impose such conditions on the acquisition as the Commission may deem advisable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

E. If the Commission (i) takes no action within the prescribed investigation period or (ii) issues notice within the prescribed investigation period of its intent not to disapprove the application, the acquisition may be completed by the applicant.

F. Any party in interest aggrieved by any decision of the Commission, as a matter of right, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia in the manner provided by law.

G. The provisions of this section shall not apply:

1. To mergers or acquisitions of assets authorized by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of § [6.2-914](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-914/);

2. If the acquisition or merger is arranged by the Commission or other supervisory authority in order to prevent the insolvency or closing of the institution; or

3. If a financial institution itself forms a corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding the stock of such financial institution and it is proposed that the shareholders of the financial institution will become the shareholders of the financial institution holding company being organized. This exclusion shall apply regardless of the fact that some shareholders of the financial institution may dissent from the proposal.
