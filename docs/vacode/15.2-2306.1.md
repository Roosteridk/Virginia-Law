# § 15.2-2306.1 Creation of working waterfront development areas.

A. Any locality may establish by ordinance one or more working waterfront development areas for the purpose of providing incentives to private entities to purchase real property and interests in real property to assemble parcels suitable for working waterfront development. Each locality establishing a working waterfront development area may grant such incentives and provide regulatory flexibility. Such zones shall be reasonably compact, shall not encompass the entire locality, and shall constitute one or more tax parcels not commonly owned. Properties that are acquired through the use of eminent domain shall not be eligible for the incentives and regulatory flexibility provided by the ordinance.

B. Incentives granted by a locality pursuant to subsection A may include, but not be limited to, (i) reduction of permit fees, (ii) reduction of user fees, (iii) reduction of any type of gross receipts tax, and (iv) waiver of tax liens to facilitate the sale of property.

C. Incentives granted pursuant to this section may extend for a period of up to 10 years from the date of initial establishment of the working waterfront development area; however, the extent and duration of any incentive shall conform to the requirements of applicable federal and state law.

D. The regulatory flexibility provided in a working waterfront development area may include (i) special zoning for the district, (ii) the use of a special permit process, (iii) exemption from certain specified ordinances, excluding ordinances or provisions of ordinances adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (§ [62.1-44.15:67](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:67/) et seq.), the Erosion and Sediment Control Law (§ [62.1-44.15:51](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:51/) et seq.), and the Virginia Stormwater Management Act (§ [62.1-44.15:24](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:24/) et seq.), and (iv) any other incentives adopted by ordinance, which shall be binding upon the locality for a period of up to 10 years.

E. This section shall not authorize any local government powers that are not expressly granted herein.

F. Prior to adopting or amending any ordinance pursuant to this section, a locality shall provide for notice and public hearing in accordance with subsection A of § [15.2-2204](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2204/).
