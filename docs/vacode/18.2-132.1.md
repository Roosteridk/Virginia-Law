# ยง 18.2-132.1 Trespass by hunters using dogs; penalty.

Any person who intentionally releases hunting dogs on the lands of another which have been posted in accordance with the provisions of ยง [18.2-134.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-134.1/) to hunt without the consent of the landowner or his agent is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation of this section within three years is a Class 1 misdemeanor and, upon conviction, the court shall revoke such person's hunting or trapping license for a period of one year. The fact that hunting dogs are present on the lands of another alone is not sufficient evidence to prove that the person acted intentionally.
