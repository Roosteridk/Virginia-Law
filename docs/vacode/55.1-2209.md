# § 55.1-2209 Time-share instrument for time-share estate project.

In addition to the requirements of § [55.1-2208](/vacode/55.1-2208/), the time-share instrument for a time-share estate project shall outline or prescribe reasonable arrangements for the management and operation of the time-share estate program and for the maintenance, repair, and furnishing of units it comprises, which shall include provisions for the following:

1. Creation of an association, the members of which shall be the time-share estate owners. The association may be formed pursuant to the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-801](/vacode/13.1-801/) et seq.); however, the association shall be formed prior to the time the project and program are registered with the Board. Nothing shall affect the validity of the association, once formed, and the rights applicable to it as granted by this chapter, notwithstanding the time when such association was formed;

2. Payment of costs and expenses of operating the time-share estate program and owning and maintaining the units it comprises;

3. Employment and termination of employment of the managing agent for the project. Any agreement pertaining to the employment of the managing agent and executed during the developer control period shall be voidable by the association at any time after termination of the developer control period for the time-share project, and any provision in such agreement to the contrary is hereby declared to be void;

4. Termination of leases and contracts for goods and services for the time-share estate project that are entered into during the developer control period. Any such lease or contract shall become voidable at the option of the association upon termination of the developer control period for the entire time-share project, or sooner if the provisions of such lease or contract so state;

5. Preparation and dissemination to time-share estate owners of the annual report required by § [55.1-2213](/vacode/55.1-2213/);

6. Adoption of standards and rules of conduct for the use, enjoyment, and occupancy of units by the time-share estate owners;

7. Collection of regular assessments, fees or dues, or special assessments from time-share estate owners to defray all time-share expenses;

8. Comprehensive general liability insurance for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of, or in connection with, the use and enjoyment of the project by time-share estate owners, their guests, and other users. The costs associated with securing and maintaining such insurance shall be a time-share expense. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to obligate the managing entity to secure insurance on the conduct of the time-share estate owners, their guests, and other users or the personal effects or property of such owners, guests, and users;

9. Methods for providing compensation or alternate use periods or monetary compensation to a time-share estate owner if his contracted-for unit cannot be made available for the period to which the owner is entitled by schedule or by confirmed reservation;

10. Procedures for imposing a monetary penalty or suspension of a time-share estate owner's rights and privileges in the time-share estate program or time-share project for failure of such owner to comply with provisions of the time-share instrument or the rules and regulations of the association with respect to the use and enjoyment of the units and the time-share project. Under these procedures, a time-share estate owner shall be given reasonable notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard and explain the charges against him in person or in writing to the board of directors of the association before a decision to impose discipline is rendered; and

11. Employment of attorneys, accountants, and other professional persons as necessary to assist in the management of the time-share estate program and the units it comprises.
