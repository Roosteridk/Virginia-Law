# § 17.1-401 Senior judge.

A. Any chief judge or judge of the Court of Appeals who is eligible for retirement, other than for disability, with the consent of a majority of the members of the court first obtained, may elect to retire under the Judicial Retirement System (§ [51.1-300](/vacode/51.1-300/) et seq.) and be known and designated as a senior judge. In addition, any chief judge or judge of the Court of Appeals who is retired under the Judicial Retirement System (§ [51.1-300](/vacode/51.1-300/) et seq.) shall be subject to recall, with the consent of a majority of the members of the court, and may be known and designated as a senior judge.

B. Any chief judge or judge who has retired from active service, as provided in subsection A, may be designated and assigned by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals to perform the duties of a judge of the court. Such judge shall have all the powers, duties, and privileges attendant on the position for which he is recalled to serve.

C. While serving in such status, a senior judge shall be deemed to be serving in a temporary capacity and, in addition to the retirement benefits received by such judge, shall receive as compensation a sum equal to one-fourth of the total compensation of an active judge of the Court of Appeals for a similar period of service. A retired judge, while performing the duties of a senior judge, shall be furnished office space, support staff, a telephone, and supplies as are furnished a judge of the court.

D. A judge may terminate his status as a senior judge, or such status may be terminated by a majority of the members of the court. Each judge designated a senior judge shall serve a one-year term unless the court, by order or otherwise, extends the term for an additional year. There shall be no limit on the number of terms a senior judge may so serve.

E. Only seven retired judges shall serve as senior judges at any one time.

F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to increase the number of judges of the Court of Appeals provided for in § [17.1-400](/vacode/17.1-400/).
