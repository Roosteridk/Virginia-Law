# § 46.2-341.21 Driving while disqualified; penalties.

No person whose privilege to drive a commercial motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked or who has been disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle or who has been ordered out of service, and who has been given notice of, or reasonably should know of the suspension, revocation, disqualification, or out-of-service order shall operate a commercial motor vehicle anywhere in the Commonwealth until the period of such suspension, revocation, disqualification, or out-of-service order has terminated, nor shall any person operate on any highway any vehicle that has been declared out of service until such time as the out-of-service declaration has been lifted.

Any person who violates this section shall, for the first offense, be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor, and for the second or any subsequent offense, be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; however, if the offense is the violation of an out-of-service order, the minimum mandatory fine shall be $2,500 for any person so convicted of a first offense and $5,000 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense. Upon receipt of a record of a violation of this section, the Commissioner shall impose an additional disqualification in accordance with the provisions of §§ [46.2-341.18](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/) and [46.2-341.18:01](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18:01/).
