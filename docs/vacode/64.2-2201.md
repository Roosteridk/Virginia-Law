# ยง 64.2-2201 Requirement of survival by 120 hours for statutory rights.

Except as provided in ยง [64.2-2205](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2205/), if the (i) title to property, (ii) devolution of property, or (iii) right to elect an interest in property, an augmented estate share or exempt property, or homestead or family allowance depends upon an individual surviving another, an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the other individual by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the other. However, this section does not apply if its application would result in a taking of an intestate estate by the Commonwealth.
