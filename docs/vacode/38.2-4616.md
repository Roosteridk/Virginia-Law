In connection with any transaction involving the purchase or sale of an interest in residential real property in this Commonwealth, the settlement agent as defined in ยง [55.1-900](/vacode/55.1-900/), before the disbursement of any funds, shall obtain from the purchaser a statement in writing that he has been notified by the settlement agent that the purchaser may wish to obtain owner's title insurance coverage including affirmative mechanics' lien coverage, if available, and of the general nature of such coverage, and that the purchaser does or does not desire such coverage.
