A. Any cigarettes that have been sold or offered for sale that do not comply with the performance standard required by § [9.1-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-210/) shall be deemed contraband and subject to forfeiture and disposal by the Commonwealth; however, prior to the destruction of any cigarettes forfeited pursuant to this subsection, the true holder of the trademark rights in the cigarette brand shall be permitted to inspect such cigarettes.

B. The Department and the State Fire Marshal, in the regular course of conducting inspections of retailers and wholesalers, may inspect cigarettes to determine if the cigarettes are marked as required by § [9.1-212](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-212/). If the cigarettes are not marked as required, the Department shall notify the Director.

C. Whenever law-enforcement personnel, the State Fire Marshal or local fire marshal appointed under § [27-30](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/27-30/), or a duly authorized representative of the Director discovers any cigarettes that have not been marked in the manner required by § [9.1-212](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-212/), such personnel are hereby authorized and empowered to seize and take possession of such cigarettes. Such cigarettes shall be turned over to the Department and shall be forfeited to the Commonwealth. Cigarettes seized pursuant to this section shall be destroyed; however, prior to the destruction of any cigarette seized pursuant to this subsection, the true holder of the trademark rights in the cigarette brand shall be permitted to inspect the cigarette.
