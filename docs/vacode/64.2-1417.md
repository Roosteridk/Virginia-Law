A judgment or decree against the personal representative of a decedent, committee of a convict, or conservator of an incapacitated person as defined in ยง [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) for a debt due from the decedent, convict, or incapacitated person may, without taking an account of the transactions of the representative, conservator, or committee, be entered to be paid out of the estate of the decedent, convict, or incapacitated person in, or that shall come into, the possession of the representative, conservator, or committee to be administered.
