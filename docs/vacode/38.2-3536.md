In the case of a claim for loss of time for disability, each group accident and sickness insurance policy shall contain a provision that written proof of the loss shall be furnished to the insurer within ninety days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable. Subsequent written proof of the continuance of the disability shall be furnished to the insurer at reasonable intervals required by the insurer.
