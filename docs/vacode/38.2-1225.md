The attorney or other interested persons may advance to a domestic reciprocal any funds required in its operations. No repayment of the principal, or any payment of interest thereon, in whole or in part, shall be made without the approval of the Commission. The principal advanced and any interest accrued thereon shall not be treated as a liability of the reciprocal until the repayment of principal or payment of interest is approved by the Commission; nonetheless, all statements published or filed shall show accrued interest and the amount of principal remaining unpaid. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution, all claims under the instrument shall be subordinated to subscriber, claimant and beneficiary claims as well as debts owed to all other classes of creditors. The principal advanced shall not be withdrawn or repaid and no payments of interest thereon shall be made unless the reciprocal has sufficient earned surplus in excess of its minimum required surplus. No commission or brokerage shall be paid in acquiring the funds. Interest on the principal advanced shall be at a rate not exceeding the one-year treasury bill interest rate plus three percentage points at the time the loan is made or renewed.
