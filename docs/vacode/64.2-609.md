# ยง 64.2-609 Money and personal property belonging to nonresident decedents.

A. When any person, at the time of his death domiciled outside of the Commonwealth, owned stocks, bonds, securities, money, or tangible personal property located in the Commonwealth or was entitled to any debts, choses in action, or tangible personal property in the Commonwealth, the person, firm, or corporation holding such stocks, bonds, securities, money, debts, tangible personal property, and choses in action shall retain such assets for 90 days from the death of such decedent. After the 90-day period, the person, firm, or corporation shall pay over or deliver on demand such portion of the assets for which the person, firm, or corporation has received no legal notice of any lien or encumbrance to an executor, administrator, or other personal representative, qualified according to the laws of the decedent's domicile if the value of such assets in the Commonwealth is, to the knowledge of the person holding or owing such assets, less than $25,000. When the value of such stocks, bonds, securities, money, debts, tangible personal property, and choses in action is $25,000 or more, the holder may pay or deliver such assets to an executor, administrator, or other personal representative, qualified in accordance with the law of the decedent's domicile, 30 days after the holder gives public notice of his intention to make such a transfer by publication thereof once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, town, or county wherein the holder resides or has his principal place of business, provided that at the time of such payment or delivery, the holder has no actual notice of the appointment of a personal representative for such decedent in the Commonwealth and has received no legal notice of any lien or encumbrance upon such assets.

B. This section shall be construed as providing, as to the payment of money and the delivery of personal property belonging to nonresident decedents or their estates, optional methods of procedure in addition to those otherwise permitted or provided by law, including a comparable law of the state in which the nonresident decedents were domiciled, and shall not as to such matters add any limitations or restrictions to existing law.
