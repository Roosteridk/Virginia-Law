A. It is a goal of the Commonwealth to compensate its employees at a rate comparable to the rate of compensation for employees in the private sector of the Commonwealth in similar occupations, and consistently recruit and retain the most suitably qualified employees. To achieve this goal, the Director of the Department shall annually review (i) recruitment and retention trends, (ii) the functions performed by each classified job role, (iii) the number of employees and distribution of classified job roles across state agencies, and (iv) how the salaries for each classified job role compare to salaries paid by other employers in the Commonwealth and, as appropriate, to comparable salaries at a regional or national level.

B. The Director of the Department shall, on or before September 1 of each odd-numbered year, submit a report on (i) the classified job roles that should receive higher salary increases based on identified recruitment and retention challenges, (ii) the appropriate amount by which the salary of such classified job roles should be increased, and (iii) cost estimates for funding any salary increases to the Governor and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations.
