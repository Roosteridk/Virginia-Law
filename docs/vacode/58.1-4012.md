# ยง 58.1-4012 Suspension and revocation of licenses.

The Director may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew, after notice and a hearing, any license issued pursuant to this chapter. Such license may, however, be temporarily suspended by the Director without prior notice, pending any prosecution, hearing or investigation, whether by a third party or by the Director. A license may be suspended, revoked or refused renewal by the Director for one or more of the following reasons:

1. Failure to properly account for lottery tickets received or the proceeds of the sale of lottery tickets;

2. Failure to file a bond if required by the Director or to comply with instructions and rules and regulations of the Department concerning the licensed activity, especially with regard to the prompt payment of claims;

3. Conviction of any offense referenced in subsection C of ยง [58.1-4009](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-4009/) subsequent to licensure;

4. Failure to file any return or report, to keep records or to pay any fees or other charges required by this chapter;

5. Any act of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or conduct prejudicial to public confidence in the Commonwealth lottery;

6. If the number of lottery tickets sold by the lottery sales agent is insufficient to meet administrative costs and public convenience is adequately served by other licensees;

7. A material change, since issuance of the license, with respect to any matters required to be considered by the Director under this chapter; or

8. Other factors established by Department regulation.
