Except as otherwise provided, for the purposes of this chapter, a moped shall be deemed a motor vehicle.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter every person who owns a motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or his authorized attorney-in-fact, shall, before it is operated on any highway in the Commonwealth, register with the Department and obtain from the Department the registration card and certificate of title for the vehicle. Individuals applying for registration shall provide the Department with the residence address of the owner of the vehicle being registered. A business applying for registration shall provide the Department with the street address of the owner or lessee of the vehicle being registered.

At the option of the applicant for registration, the address shown on the title and registration card may be either a post office box or the business or residence address of the applicant.

Unless he has previously applied for registration and a certificate of title or he is exempted under §§ [46.2-619](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-619/), [46.2-626.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-626.1/), [46.2-631](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-631/), and [46.2-1206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1206/), every person residing in the Commonwealth who owns a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, shall, within 30 days of the purchase or transfer, apply to the Department for a certificate of ownership.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require titling or registration in the Commonwealth of any farm tractor or special construction and forestry equipment, as defined in § [46.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-100/).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, provided such vehicle is registered and titled elsewhere in the United States, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require titling or registration in the Commonwealth of any vehicle located in the Commonwealth if that vehicle is registered to a non-Virginia resident active duty military service member, activated reserve or national guard member, mobilized reserve or national guard member living in the Commonwealth, or person who is serving a full-time church service or proselyting mission of not more than 36 months and who is not gainfully employed.
