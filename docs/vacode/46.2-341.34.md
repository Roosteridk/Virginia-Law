# ยง 46.2-341.34 Appeals.

Any person denied a commercial driver's license or who has been disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle under the provisions of this article is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (ยง [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.). No appeal shall lie in any case in which such denial or disqualification was mandatory except to determine the identity of the person concerned when the question of identity is in dispute.

From the final decision of the circuit court, either party shall have an appeal as of right to the Court of Appeals.

While an appeal is pending from the action of the Department disqualifying the person or denying him a license, or from the court affirming the action of the Department, the person aggrieved shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle.
