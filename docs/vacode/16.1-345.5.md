# § 16.1-345.5 Continuation of mandatory outpatient treatment order.

A. At any time within 30 days prior to the expiration of a mandatory outpatient treatment order, the community services board that is required to monitor the minor's compliance with the order may file with the juvenile and domestic relations district court for the jurisdiction in which the minor resides a motion for review to continue the order for a period not to exceed 90 days.

B. The court shall grant the motion for review and enter an appropriate order without further hearing if it is joined by (i) the minor's parents and the minor if he is 14 years of age or older, or (ii) the minor's parents if the minor is younger than 14 years of age. If the minor's parents and the minor, if necessary, do not join the motion, the court shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing in accordance with subsection A of § [16.1-345.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.4/).

C. Upon receipt of the motion for review, the court shall appoint a qualified evaluator who shall personally examine the minor pursuant to § [16.1-342](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-342/). The community services board required to monitor the minor's compliance with the mandatory outpatient treatment order shall provide a preadmission screening report as required in § [16.1-340.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340.4/).

D. After observing the minor, reviewing the preadmission screening report, and considering the appointed qualified evaluator's report and any other relevant evidence referenced in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/) and subsection A of § [16.1-345.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.2/), the court may make one of the dispositions specified in subsection D of § [16.1-345.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.4/). If the court finds that a continued period of mandatory outpatient treatment is warranted, it may continue the order for a period not to exceed 90 days. Any order of mandatory outpatient treatment that is in effect at the time a motion for review for the continuation of the order is filed shall remain in effect until the court enters a subsequent order in the case.

E. For the purposes of this section, the "court" shall not include a special justice as authorized in § [37.2-803](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-803/).
