If a member of the Authority who is a chief elected officer of a locality is unable to attend a meeting of the Authority, he may designate another current elected official of such governing body to attend a meeting of the Authority. Such designation shall be for the purposes of one meeting and shall be submitted in writing or electronically to the chairman of the Authority prior to the affected meeting.

At the end of a term, a member shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed and qualifies. A member who is appointed after a term has begun serves only for the rest of the term and until a successor is appointed and qualifies. The members of the Authority shall receive no compensation for their services, but a member may be reimbursed by the Authority for reasonable expenses actually incurred in the performance of the duties of that office.
