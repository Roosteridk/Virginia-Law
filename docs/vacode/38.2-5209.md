# ยง 38.2-5209 Incontestability.

Each long-term care policy or certificate shall include an incontestability provision that includes the following:

1. For a policy or certificate that has been in force for less than six months, an insurer may rescind a long-term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance of coverage.

2. For a policy or certificate that has been in force for at least six months but less than two years, an insurer may rescind a long-term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance of coverage and that pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought.

3. After a policy or certificate has been in force for two years, it is not contestable upon the grounds of misrepresentation alone, and such policy or certificate may be contested only upon a showing that the insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to the insured's health.

4. In the event of the death of the insured, this section shall not apply to the remaining death benefit of a life insurance policy that accelerates benefits for long-term care. In such event, the contestability of the remaining death benefits under such a life insurance policy shall be governed by the provisions of ยง [38.2-3305](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3305/) or ยง [38.2-3326](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3326/). In all other situations, this section shall apply to life insurance policies that accelerate benefits for long-term care.
