Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1 or 4, if the carrier accepts applications through an online credentialing system, require the carrier to recognize notification to a new provider applicant through the online credentialing system that the provider has submitted and attested to the application as notice by the carrier that the application is received. If the carrier does not accept applications through an online credentialing system, the carrier shall be required, within 10 days of receiving an application, to provide notification to the new provider applicant either by mail or electronic mail, as selected by the applicant, that the application was received;

4. Apply only if a contractual relationship exists between the carrier and the new provider applicant or entity for whom the new provider applicant is employed or engaged; and

C. Nothing in this section shall require reimbursement of the new provider applicant-rendered services that are not benefits or services covered by the carrier's health benefit plan.

D.

If the new provider applicant is not credentialed by the carrier, the new provider applicant or any entity that employs or engages such physician, mental health professional, or other provider shall not collect any amount from the patient for health care services or mental health services provided from the date the completed credentialing application was submitted to the carrier until the applicant received notification from the carrier that credentialing was denied.
