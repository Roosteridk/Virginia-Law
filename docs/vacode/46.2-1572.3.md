# ยง 46.2-1572.3 Waiver prohibited.

No motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or subsidiary thereof shall obtain from a motor vehicle dealer a waiver of the dealer's rights by threatening to impose a detriment upon the dealer's business or threatening to withhold from the dealer any entitlement, benefit, or service to which the dealer is entitled by virtue of any franchise agreement, contract, statute, regulation, or law of any kind or which has been granted to more than one other franchisee of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch in the Commonwealth. This section shall not apply to good faith settlement of disputes, including disputes pertaining to contract negotiations, in which a waiver is granted in exchange for fair consideration in the form of a benefit conferred upon the dealer; however, this section shall apply to a dispute as to whether a waiver of such rights by a motor vehicle dealer has been obtained in violation of this section.
