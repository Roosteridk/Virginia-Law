# § 16.1-340.1:1 Facility of temporary detention.

A. In each case in which an employee or designee of the local community services board is required to make an evaluation of a minor pursuant to subsection B, G, or H of § [16.1-340](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340/), an employee or designee of the local community services board shall, upon being notified of the need for such evaluation, contact the state facility for the area in which the community services board is located and notify the state facility that the minor will be transported to the facility upon issuance of a temporary detention order if no other facility of temporary detention can be identified by the time of the expiration of the period of emergency custody pursuant to § [16.1-340](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340/). Upon completion of the evaluation, the employee or designee of the local community services board shall convey to the state facility information about the minor necessary to allow the state facility to determine the services the minor will require upon admission.

B. A state facility may, following the notice in accordance with subsection A, conduct a search for an alternative facility that is able and willing to provide temporary detention and appropriate care to the minor, which may include another state facility if the state facility notified in accordance with subsection A is unable to provide temporary detention and appropriate care for the minor. Under no circumstances shall a state facility fail or refuse to admit a minor who meets the criteria for temporary detention pursuant to § [16.1-340.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340.1/) unless an alternative facility that is able to provide temporary detention and appropriate care agrees to accept the minor for temporary detention, and the minor shall not during the duration of the temporary detention order be released from custody except for purposes of transporting the minor to the state facility or alternative facility in accordance with the provisions of § [16.1-340.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340.2/). If an alternative facility is identified and agrees to accept the minor for temporary detention, the state facility shall notify the community services board, and an employee or designee of the community services board shall designate the alternative facility on the prescreening report.

C. The facility of temporary detention designated in accordance with this section shall be one that has been approved pursuant to regulations of the State Board of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.
