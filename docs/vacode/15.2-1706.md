# § 15.2-1706 Certification through training required for all law-enforcement officers; waiver of requirements.

A. All law-enforcement officers as defined in § [9.1-101](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-101/) and all jail officers as defined in § [53.1-1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-1/) must be certified through the successful completion of training at an approved criminal justice training academy in order to remain eligible for appointment or employment. In order to obtain such certification, all entry level law-enforcement officers seeking certification on or after July 1, 2003, shall successfully complete statewide certification examinations developed and administered by the Department of Criminal Justice Services. The Department may delegate administration of the examinations to an approved criminal justice training academy and may revoke such delegation at its discretion. The appointee's or employee's hiring agency must provide the Department of Criminal Justice Services with verification that law-enforcement or jail officers first hired after July 1, 1994, have met the minimum standards set forth in § [15.2-1705](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1705/).

B. The requirement for the successful completion of the law-enforcement certification examination may be waived by the Department of Criminal Justice Services based upon previous law-enforcement experience and training. To be eligible for such waiver, the individual must have applied for and been granted an exemption or partial exemption in accordance with § [9.1-116](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-116/).
