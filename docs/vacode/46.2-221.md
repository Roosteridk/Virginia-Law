# § 46.2-221 Certain state agencies to report to Department concerning the blind and nearly blind; use of such information by Department; Department to report names of persons refused licenses for defective vision; reports to law-enforcement agencies concerning certain blind or visually impaired persons who operate motor vehicles.

Every state agency having knowledge of the blind or visually handicapped, maintaining any register of the blind, or administering either tax deductions or exemptions for or aid to the blind or visually handicapped shall report in January of each year to the Department the names of all persons so known, registered or benefiting from such deductions or exemptions, for aid to the blind or visually handicapped. This information shall be used by the Department only for the purpose of determining qualifications of these persons for licensure under Chapter 3 (§ [46.2-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-300/) et seq.). If any such state agency has knowledge that any person so reported continues to operate a motor vehicle, such agency may provide this information to appropriate law-enforcement agencies as otherwise permitted by law.

The Department shall report to the Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired and the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services at least annually the name and address of every person who has been refused a driver's license solely or partly because of failure to pass the Department's visual examination.

If any employee of the Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired makes a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles or provides information to an appropriate law-enforcement agency as required or permitted by this section concerning any client of the agency, it shall not be deemed to have been made in violation of the client-agency relationship.
