A. Any transfer of or lien upon the property of an insurer that is made or created within four months before the institution of delinquency proceedings under this chapter shall be voidable if (i) done with the intent of giving or enabling any creditor to obtain a greater percentage of payment of the debt than any other creditor of the same class and (ii) the creditor accepting the transfer has reasonable cause to believe that a preference will occur.

B. Every director, officer, employee, stockholder, member, subscriber, and other person acting on behalf of an insurer who is involved in any act described in subsection A of this section, and every person receiving property of an insurer as a result of this act, shall be personally liable and held accountable to the receiver.

C. A receiver in any proceeding under this chapter may avoid any transfer of or lien upon the property of an insurer that any creditor, stockholder, subscriber or member of the insurer might have avoided. The receiver may also recover the transferred property unless the person was a valid holder for value before the date of the institution of delinquency proceedings under this chapter. The property or its value may be recovered from anyone who has received it except as a valid holder for value as specified in this subsection.
