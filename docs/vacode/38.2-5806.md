2. A continuing care facility that satisfies clauses (i) and (ii) of subdivision 1 shall not be obligated to accept as a skilled nursing unit patient any one other than a resident of the continuing care facility; and neither the health carrier nor the continuing care facility shall be allowed to include the skilled nursing unit or facilities on the list required by ยง [38.2-5802](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-5802/) or to advertise in any other way that the facility's skilled nursing unit is a participating provider with respect to coverage offered by the MCHIP for Medicare benefits or skilled nursing unit facilities for other than the continuing care facility's residents.
