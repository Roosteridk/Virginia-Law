A city or town subject to the provisions of this article shall certify to the governing body of the county within which the highway, or the greater part thereof, lies a copy of the ordinance adopted by the city or town as provided in this article. The governing body of the county, upon receipt, shall within 30 days (i) consider the reasonableness of the action contemplated by the city or town ordinance, (ii) propose and publish an ordinance approving or disapproving the action contemplated by the city or town, and (iii) conduct a hearing thereon.

The judgment of the circuit court may be appealed to the Court of Appeals.
