# § 17.1-258.3:2 Official certificates and certified records in digital form.

A clerk of circuit court may establish a system for providing official certificates and certified records in digital form of any document maintained by the clerk. The clerk may require any person to provide proof of identity to the clerk in order to obtain access to such records. The clerk or his designated application service provider may assess an additional fee not to exceed $5 per official certificate accompanying or attesting the certified records, subject to subdivision A 8 of § [17.1-275](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275/) and to the exemptions provided in § [17.1-267](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-267/). The clerk may perform such other notarial acts as allowed under § [47.1-12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/47.1-12/). The fee shall be paid to the clerk's office and deposited by the clerk into the clerk's nonreverting local fund to be used to cover operational expenses as defined in § [17.1-295](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-295/). Nothing herein shall be construed to require any person to obtain an electronic certificate of any record maintained by the clerk, and such record may continue to be obtained in paper form. The clerk of the circuit court of any jurisdiction shall be immune from suit arising from any acts or omissions relating to providing official certificates and certified records in digital form of any document maintained by the clerk pursuant to this section unless the clerk was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct.
