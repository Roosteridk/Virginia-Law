# § 45.2-837  Bleeder systems.

A. Every mine shall have a system, approved by the Chief, of bleeder openings of air courses designed to provide positive movement of air through or around worked-out areas. Such system shall be sufficient to prevent a hazardous accumulation of gas in any such area and to minimize the effect of variations in atmospheric pressure. Each operator shall submit a bleeder system plan that complies with requirements developed by the Chief.

B. The system requirements developed by the Chief shall, at a minimum, address standards for (i) supplemental roof supports, (ii) water accumulation, (iii) continuous movement of gases from gob areas, (iv) methane content, (v) the use and operation of degasification systems, (vi) air flow direction and content, and (vii) ventilation controls. The Chief shall not approve a plan that provides for a methane content exceeding 4.5 percent in bleeder air courses.

C. This section shall not prohibit the sealing of worked-out areas in accordance with § [45.2-845](/vacode/45.2-845/). The mine map requirements of § [45.2-542](/vacode/45.2-542/) may be used to depict bleeder system standards specified in this section.

D. Failure to comply with an approved plan is a violation of this section.
