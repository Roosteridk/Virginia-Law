# § 8.2A-529 Lessor's action for the rent.

(1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in subsection (1) of § [8.2A-523](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-523/) or subdivision (3) (a) of § [8.2A-523](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-523/) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessor complies with subsection (2) of this section, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages:

(a) For goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (§ [8.2A-219](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-219/)), (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under § [8.2A-530](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-530/), less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default; and

(b) For goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under § [8.2A-530](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-530/), less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contract and are in the lessor's control.

(3) The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages will be governed by § [8.2A-527](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-527/) or § [8.2A-528](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-528/), and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to § [8.2A-527](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-527/) or § [8.2A-528](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-528/).

(4) Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1) of this section entitles the lessee to use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement.

(5) After a lessee has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of goods, has failed to pay rent then due, or has repudiated (§ [8.2A-402](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-402/)), a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for nonacceptance under §§ [8.2A-527](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-527/) and [8.2A-528](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-528/).
