"IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR INSURANCE"

"In the event you need to contact someone about this insurance for any reason, please contact your agent. If no agent was involved in the sale of this insurance, or if you have additional questions, you may contact the insurance company issuing this insurance at the following address and telephone number: [Insert the appropriate address and telephone number, toll free number if available, for the company's home or regional office]."

C. In any life insurance or annuity contract containing a beneficiary designation in which the designated beneficiary is the spouse of the policy owner, the following notice shall be included with the policy when issued, either attached to or incorporated into the front or first page of such contract:

"BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION MAY NOT APPLY IN THE EVENT OF ANNULMENT OR DIVORCE"

"Under Virginia law (Virginia Code ยง [20-111.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-111.1/)), a revocable beneficiary designation in a policy owned by one spouse that names the other spouse as beneficiary becomes void upon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce, and the death benefit prevented from passing to a former spouse will be paid as if the former spouse had predeceased the decedent. In the event of annulment or divorce proceedings, and if it is the intent of the parties that the beneficiary designation of the former spouse is to continue, you are advised to make certain that one of the following courses of action is taken prior to the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce: (i) change the beneficiary designation to make it irrevocable; (ii) change the ownership of the policy or contract; (iii) execute a separate written agreement stating the intention of both parties that the beneficiary designation is to remain in effect beyond the date of entry of the decree of annulment or divorce; or (iv) make certain that the decree of annulment or divorce contains a provision stating that the beneficiary designation is not to be revoked pursuant to ยง [20-111.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-111.1/)."

D. If, under the contract, the exact amount of premiums is determinable only at the termination of the contract, a statement of the basis and rates upon which the final premium is to be determined and paid shall be furnished to any policy-examining bureau having jurisdiction or to the insured upon request.

E. This section shall not apply to surety insurance contracts.
