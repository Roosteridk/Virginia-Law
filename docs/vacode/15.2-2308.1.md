The applicant, landowner or his agent or attorney may have ex parte communications with a member of the board prior to the hearing but may not discuss the facts or law relative to a particular case. If any ex parte discussion of facts or law in fact occurs, the party engaging in such communication shall inform the other party as soon as practicable and advise the other party of the substance of such communication. For purposes of this section, regardless of whether all parties participate, ex parte communications shall not include (i) discussions as part of a public meeting or (ii) discussions prior to a public meeting to which staff of the governing body, the applicant, landowner or his agent or attorney are all invited.

Any materials relating to a particular case, including a staff recommendation or report furnished to a member of the board, shall be made available without cost to such applicant, appellant or other person aggrieved under § [15.2-2314](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2314/), as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event more than three business days of providing such materials to a member of the board. If the applicant, appellant or other person aggrieved under § [15.2-2314](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2314/) requests additional documents or materials be provided by the locality other than those materials provided to the board, such request shall be made pursuant to § [2.2-3704](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3704/). Any such materials furnished to a member of the board shall also be made available for public inspection pursuant to subsection F of § [2.2-3707](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3707/).
