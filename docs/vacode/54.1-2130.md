# § 54.1-2130 Definitions.

As used in this article:

"Agency" means every relationship in which a real estate licensee acts for or represents a person as an agent by such person's express authority in a commercial or residential real estate transaction, unless a different legal relationship is intended and is agreed to as part of the brokerage agreement. Nothing in this article shall prohibit a licensee and a client from agreeing in writing to a brokerage relationship under which the licensee acts as an independent contractor or which imposes on a licensee obligations in addition to those provided in this article. If a licensee agrees to additional obligations, however, the licensee shall be responsible for the additional obligations agreed to with the client in the brokerage agreement. A real estate licensee who enters into a brokerage relationship based upon a written brokerage agreement that specifically states that the real estate licensee is acting as an independent contractor and not as an agent shall have the obligations agreed to by the parties in the brokerage agreement, and such real estate licensee and its employees shall comply with the provisions of subdivisions A 3 through 7 and subsections B and E of § [54.1-2131](/vacode/54.1-2131/); subdivisions A 3 through 7 and subsections B and E of § [54.1-2132](/vacode/54.1-2132/); subdivisions A 3 through 7 and subsections B and E of § [54.1-2133](/vacode/54.1-2133/); subdivisions A 3 through 7 and subsections B and E of § [54.1-2134](/vacode/54.1-2134/); and subdivisions A 2 through 6 and subsections C and D of § [54.1-2135](/vacode/54.1-2135/) but otherwise shall have no obligations under §§ [54.1-2131](/vacode/54.1-2131/) through [54.1-2135](/vacode/54.1-2135/).
