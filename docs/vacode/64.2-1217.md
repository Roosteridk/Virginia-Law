# ยง 64.2-1217 Forfeiture of fiduciary's commission.

If a fiduciary wholly fails to file an account before the commissioner of accounts containing a statement of all matters required in ยง [64.2-1206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1206/), together with all other statements and items therein required for any year, within four months after the year's expiration or, though the fiduciary files an account before the commissioner of accounts, if the commissioner of accounts finds the fiduciary is chargeable for that year with any money or other property not included in the statement, the fiduciary shall receive no compensation for his services during such year or any commission on such money or other property unless allowed by the commissioner of accounts for good cause shown. The circuit court shall review the commissioner of accounts' action in such case upon the filing of timely exceptions by any interested person. This section shall not apply to a fiduciary who has filed a statement of his accounts within such year before a commissioner in chancery who in a pending suit has been ordered to settle his account.
