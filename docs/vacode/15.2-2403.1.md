# ยง 15.2-2403.1 Creation of urban transportation service districts.

A. The boundaries of any urban transportation service district created pursuant to this article shall be agreed upon by both the local governing body of an urban county and by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. The overall density of an urban transportation service district shall be one residential unit per gross acre or greater. In the event of a disagreement between the Board and the governing body of an urban county in regard to the boundaries of an urban transportation service district, the parties may request that the Commission on Local Government serve as a mediator. For purposes of this section, an "urban county" means any county with a population of greater than 90,000, according to the United States Census of 2000, that did not maintain its roads as of January 1, 2007.

B. Any urban county that has established an urban transportation service district in accordance with this section shall maintain the roads within such district. Any such county shall receive an amount equal to the per lane mile maintenance payments made to cities and certain towns pursuant to ยง [33.2-319](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-319/) for the area within the district for purposes of road maintenance.
