A. A business trust that has ceased to exist may apply to the Commission for reinstatement within five years thereafter, unless the cancellation was by order of the Commission (i) entered pursuant to subdivision A 1 of § [13.1-1238.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1238.2/) or (ii) entered pursuant to § [13.1-1235](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1235/) and the circuit court's decree directing dissolution contains no provision for reinstatement of the existence of the business trust.

B. To have its existence reinstated, a business trust shall provide the Commission with the following:

1. An application for reinstatement, which may be in the form of a letter, that includes the identification number issued by the Commission to the business trust;

2. A reinstatement fee of $100;

3. All annual registration fees and penalties that were due before the business trust ceased to exist and that would have been assessed or imposed to the date of reinstatement if the business trust's existence had not been canceled;

4. If the name of the business trust does not comply with the provisions of § [13.1-1214](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1214/) at the time of reinstatement, articles of amendment to the articles of trust to change the business trust's name to a name that satisfies the provisions of § [13.1-1214](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1214/), with the fee required by this chapter for the filing of articles of amendment; and

5. If the business trust's registered agent has filed a statement of resignation and a new registered agent has not been appointed, a statement of change pursuant to § [13.1-1221](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1221/).

C. If the business trust complies with the provisions of this section, the Commission shall enter an order of reinstatement of existence. Upon entry of the order, the existence of the business trust shall be deemed to have continued from the date of the cancellation as if the cancellation had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the business trust or a beneficial owner, trustee or other agent after the cancellation and before the reinstatement is determined as if cancellation of the business trust's existence had never occurred.
