If the plan of merger or share exchange was adopted by the board of directors without approval by the shareholders of a domestic corporation that was a party to the merger or share exchange, a statement that the plan of merger or share exchange was duly approved by the board of directors including the reason shareholder approval was not required and, in the case of a merger pursuant to § [13.1-719.1](/vacode/13.1-719.1/), the additional statements required by subsection D of § [13.1-719.1](/vacode/13.1-719.1/); and
