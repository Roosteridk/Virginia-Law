# § 37.2-817.3 Rescission of mandatory outpatient treatment order.

A. If the community services board determines at any time prior to the expiration of the mandatory outpatient treatment order or order authorizing discharge to mandatory outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment that the person has complied with the order and no longer meets the criteria for involuntary treatment, or that continued mandatory outpatient treatment is no longer necessary for any other reason, it shall file a petition to rescind the order with the court that entered the order or to which venue has been transferred. If the court agrees with the community services board's determination, the court shall rescind the order. Otherwise, the court shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing in accordance with subsection A of § [37.2-817.2](/vacode/37.2-817.2/).

B. At any time after 30 days from entry of the mandatory outpatient treatment order or from the discharge of the person from involuntary inpatient treatment pursuant to an order authorizing discharge to mandatory outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment, the person may petition the court to rescind the order on the grounds that he no longer meets the criteria for mandatory outpatient treatment as specified in subsection C1 or D of § [37.2-817](/vacode/37.2-817/). The court shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing in accordance with subsection A of § [37.2-817.2](/vacode/37.2-817.2/). The community services board required to monitor the person's compliance with the mandatory outpatient treatment order or order authorizing discharge to mandatory outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment shall provide a preadmission screening report as required in § [37.2-816](/vacode/37.2-816/). After observing the person, and considering the person's current condition, any material noncompliance with the mandatory outpatient treatment order or order authorizing discharge to mandatory outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment on the part of the person, and any other relevant evidence referred to in subsection C of § [37.2-817](/vacode/37.2-817/), shall make one of the dispositions specified in subsection D of § [37.2-817.2](/vacode/37.2-817.2/). The person may not file a petition to rescind the order more than once during a 90-day period.
