Unless reserved to the shareholders in the articles of incorporation, the board of directors or, if authorized pursuant to subdivision D 7 of § [13.1-689](/vacode/13.1-689/), a committee of the board of directors or a senior executive officer, may authorize the issuance of rights, options, or warrants and determine (i) the terms and conditions upon which the rights, options, or warrants are issued and (ii) the terms, including the consideration for which the shares or other securities are to be issued. The authorization for the corporation to issue such rights, options, or warrants constitutes authorization of the issuance of the shares or other securities for which the rights, options, or warrants are exercisable.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of § [13.1-638](/vacode/13.1-638/), the terms and conditions of rights, options, or warrants issued by a corporation may include, without limitation, restrictions or conditions that (i) preclude or limit the exercise, transfer, or receipt thereof by designated persons or classes of persons or by any transferee or transferees of such persons or classes of persons or (ii) invalidate or void such rights, options, or warrants held by designated persons or classes of persons or by any transferee or transferees of such persons or classes of persons. Any action or determination by the board of directors or, if authorized pursuant to subdivision D 7 of § [13.1-689](/vacode/13.1-689/), a committee of the board of directors, with respect to the issuance, the terms and conditions of or the redemption of rights, options, or warrants shall be subject to the provisions of § [13.1-690](/vacode/13.1-690/) and shall be valid if taken or determined in compliance therewith.

C. The board of directors may, subject to such limitations as the board of directors may establish, authorize one or more officers to (i) designate the recipients of rights, options, warrants, or other equity compensation awards that involve the issuance of shares and (ii) determine, within an amount and subject to any other limitations established by the board of directors and, if applicable, the shareholders, the number of such rights, options, warrants, or other equity compensation awards and the terms and conditions thereof to be received by the recipients, provided that an officer may not use such authority to designate himself as a recipient of such rights, options, warrants, or other equity compensation awards.
