1. A statement disclosing the effect on the proposed transfer of any right of first refusal or other restraint on transfer of the time-share or any portion of such time-share;

2. A copy of the time-share instrument;

3. A copy of the current bylaws and rules and regulations of the time-share estate owners' association, if any, and the amendments to such bylaws, rules, or regulations;

4. A copy of the current annual report prepared pursuant to ยง [55.1-2213](/vacode/55.1-2213/);

5. A statement setting forth the amount of any expense liability and unpaid time-share expense or special assessment currently due and payable from the selling time-share owner, including the disclosures of any liens against the time-share due to the nonpayment of such fees or charges;

6. A statement of the nature and status of any known and pending actions or judgments against the developer, managing entity, or time-share owners' association with reference to the time-share project; and

7. A copy of a Buyer's Acknowledgment form required by ยง [55.1-2226](/vacode/55.1-2226/).

B. The developer, managing agent, or such officer of the time-share owners' association as the bylaws may specify shall furnish the certificate of resale prescribed by subsection A upon the written request of any purchaser within 30 days of the receipt of such request. Payment of the reasonable costs of preparing the certificate may be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of the certificate, but such fee shall not exceed $50.

C. A time-share owner providing a certificate pursuant to subsection A is not liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information included in the certificate, other than for judgment liens against the time-share being sold.

D. A purchaser is not liable for any unpaid time-share expense liability or fee greater than the amount set forth in the certificate prepared in conformity with subsection A. A time-share owner is not liable to a purchaser for the failure or delay of the provider to provide the certificate in a timely manner, but the purchase contract is voidable by the purchaser until the certificate has been provided and for five days after the certificate has been provided or until transfer, whichever occurs first.

E. All rights of redress of a purchaser against a selling time-share owner, the developer, the managing agent, or the association for the failure to obtain or receive the statement required by subsection A are conclusively waived upon settlement on the time-share occurring.

F. The responsibilities imposed by this section on the developer, managing agent, time-share estate owners' association, or selling time-share owner shall not be waived.
