# ยง 33.2-900 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning:

"Abandonment" means that the public's right to use a public highway, public landing, or public crossing has been extinguished.

"Discontinuance" means that the Board has determined that a highway, landing, or crossing no longer serves the public convenience warranting its maintenance at public expense; it divests the Department from maintenance responsibilities. Discontinuance does not render a highway, landing, or crossing unavailable for public use.
