# § 15.2-737 Tenant relocation payments.

The board may require by ordinance that the county and the owner divide equally the reimbursement of any tenant of a building containing at least four residential units for amounts actually expended to relocate when the tenant has been terminated by 120 days' notice given under § [55.1-1410](/vacode/55.1-1410/) in order to carry out the rehabilitation of the building. The reimbursement shall not exceed the amount to which the tenant would have been entitled to receive under §§ [25.1-407](/vacode/25.1-407/) and [25.1-415](/vacode/25.1-415/) if the real estate comprising the units had been condemned by the Department of Transportation.
