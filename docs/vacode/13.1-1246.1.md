# § 13.1-1246.1 Automatic cancellation of registration.

A. Whether or not the notice described in subsection B of § [13.1-1254](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1254/) is mailed, if any foreign business trust fails to pay its annual registration fee on or before December 31 of the year assessed, such foreign business trust shall automatically cease to be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth and its certificate of registration shall be automatically canceled as of that day.

B. If any foreign business trust whose registered agent has filed with the Commission a statement of resignation pursuant to § [13.1-1222](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1222/) fails to file a statement of change pursuant to § [13.1-1221](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1221/) within 31 days after the date on which the statement of resignation was filed, the Commission shall mail notice to the foreign business trust of the impending cancellation of its certificate of registration. If the business trust fails to file the statement of change before the last day of the second month immediately following the month in which the impending cancellation notice was mailed, the business trust shall automatically cease to be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth and its certificate of registration shall be automatically canceled as of that day.

C. The automatic cancellation of a foreign business trust's certificate of registration constitutes the appointment of the clerk of the Commission as the foreign business trust's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time the foreign business trust was registered to transact business in the Commonwealth. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission under this subsection is service on the foreign business trust and shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § [12.1-19.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/12.1-19.1/).

D. Cancellation of a foreign business trust's certificate of registration does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the foreign business trust.
