# ยง 32.1-353.1 Certified nursing facility education initiative; purpose.

The General Assembly finds that early identification of potential certified nursing facility deficiencies, coupled with the opportunity to correct any such problems, will improve quality of care and life to certified nursing facility residents in the Commonwealth. In order to implement the General Assembly's finding, early on-site training and assistance shall be provided to certified nursing facilities that are found not in substantial compliance with long-term care requirements and that meet certain requirements as set forth in the Nursing Facility Quality Improvement Program developed pursuant to ยง [32.1-353.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-353.3/).

Creative and innovative approaches to the provision of long-term care services may also be explored. Such measures can best be accomplished by using the data, expertise, and knowledge of representatives of state government and representatives from the consumer, long-term care provider, and business communities. For this reason, the Board of Medical Assistance Services, assisted by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, shall administer the education initiatives for certified nursing facility care established by this chapter.
