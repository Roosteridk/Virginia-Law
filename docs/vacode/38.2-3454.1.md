# ยง 38.2-3454.1 Renewal of health benefit plans; special exception.

Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, a health carrier may renew any health benefit plan that would otherwise be required to be canceled, discontinued, or terminated, because the health benefit plan does not meet the requirements of Title I of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152)(the PPACA) or regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent and under the terms that the appropriate federal authority has suspended enforcement of provisions of Title I of the PPACA or regulations promulgated thereunder. This section applies to health benefit plans sold or offered for sale in the individual and group markets.
