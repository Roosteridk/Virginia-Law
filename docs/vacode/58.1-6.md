# ยง 58.1-6 Priority of taxes, etc., in distributions.

In any distribution of the assets of any person or corporation assessed with taxes, levies and fees, together with penalties and interest thereon, due to the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, whether heretofore or hereafter imposed, the claims of the Commonwealth and the political subdivisions for such taxes, levies and fees, penalties and interest thereon shall be paramount and prior to all claims of general creditors, except claims given higher dignity by federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed in derogation of any lien of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions now existing or hereafter created by law; nor shall anything herein be construed to affect the laws now in force with regard to the marshalling of a decedent's estate and in regard to the exemption of a poor debtor.
