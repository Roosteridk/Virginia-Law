Each of such officers shall, on or before the first day of November in each year, report to the Board, on official estimate blanks, furnished for such purpose, an estimate in itemized form showing the amount of expenses expected to be incurred in the operation and maintenance of his office for the ensuing year, and all such expenses must be approved in advance by the Board in order to be deductible under § [17.1-284](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-284/).
