# ยง 54.1-516.1 Summary suspension of licenses or approvals; allegations to be in writing.

The Board may suspend the license or the approval of any (i) accredited training program, (ii) training manager or (iii) principal instructor of any person holding a license issued by it without a hearing simultaneously with the institution of proceedings for a hearing or an informal fact finding conference, if the relevant board finds that there is a substantial danger to the public health or safety that warrants this action. The Board may meet by telephone conference call when summarily suspending a license or the approval of an accredited training program, training manager or principal instructor if a good faith effort to assemble a quorum of the Board has failed and, in the judgment of a majority of the members of the Board, the continued practice by the licensee or approved individual or training program constitutes a substantial danger to the public health or safety. Institution of proceedings for a hearing or an informal fact finding conference shall be provided simultaneously with the summary suspension. Such hearing or conference shall be scheduled within a reasonable time of the date of the summary suspension. Allegations of violations of this section shall be made in accordance with ยง [54.1-307.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-307.1/).
