# § 24.2-686 Special elections; petition and referendum requirements; abolition of constitutional office by change in form of government.

The provisions of § [24.2-685](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-685/) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any county seeking to change its form of government pursuant to Chapter 3 (§ [15.2-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-300/) et seq.) of Title 15.2 if the effect of such change in form would be the abolition of an existing office created pursuant to [Section 4 of Article VII](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article7/section4) of the Constitution of Virginia. In such case, the circuit court may order a referendum under § [15.2-301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-301/) only if requested by a voter petition meeting the requirements of § [24.2-685](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-685/). In such case, a question in substantially the following form shall be listed first on the ballot and be followed by those provided in § [15.2-301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-301/):

"Shall the County of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ be authorized to change its form of government to one which would eliminate the elected office(s) of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"

An affirmative vote on the subsequent question or questions on the ballot shall be given effect only if a majority of those voting in the referendum have voted affirmatively on the first question to authorize such a change in the form of government.
