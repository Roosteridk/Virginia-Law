A. Any governmental entity which is an employer by virtue of subdivision 7 of subsection B of § [60.2-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-210/) shall be permitted to join with one or more other governmental entities to form a joint account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission.

B. Each governmental entity which is an employer by virtue of subdivision 7 of subsection B of § [60.2-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-210/) and each joint account formed pursuant to subsection A of this section may elect to finance benefits to its employees by either taxes as set forth in §§ [60.2-526](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-526/) through [60.2-533](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-533/), or payments in lieu of taxes. Any such election to make payments in lieu of taxes shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions 1, 2 and 4 of subsection B of § [60.2-501](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-501/). Termination of such election to make payments in lieu of taxes shall be made in accordance with subdivision 3 of subsection B of § [60.2-501](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-501/).

C. If the election to make payments in lieu of taxes is exercised, payments shall be in an amount equivalent to the full amount of regular and extended benefits paid that is attributable to service in the employ of such governmental entity. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more employers are liable for payments in lieu of taxes, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of § [60.2-504](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-504/). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if the final adjudication of a disputed claim finds the claimant totally or partially ineligible for benefits, the governmental entity shall be liable for any payment made to the claimant during or prior to the appeal process, whether made by erroneous statutory interpretation, administrative error, or incorrect wage reporting.

D. Payments in lieu of taxes by governmental entities as set forth in this section shall be made at such times and in such manner as the Commission may determine and prescribe by regulation.
