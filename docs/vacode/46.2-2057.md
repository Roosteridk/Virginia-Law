# ยง 46.2-2057 (Effective July 1, 2023) Taxicab insurance required.

A. Each operator of a motor vehicle performing a bona fide taxicab service shall file insurance as required under this article unless evidence can be shown to the Department that the operator (i) is a self-insurer under an ordinance of the city or county where the home office of the operator is located or (ii) has been issued a certificate of self-insurance pursuant to ยง [46.2-368](/vacode/46.2-368/).

B. Any self-insurance protection subject to this section shall provide for protection against the uninsured or underinsured motorist to the extent required by ยง [38.2-2206](/vacode/38.2-2206/). Notwithstanding ยง [38.2-2206](/vacode/38.2-2206/) or any other provision of this title, protection against the uninsured or underinsured motorist shall be subject to a limit exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each motor vehicle, as follows: (i) a limit of $25,000 due to bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident; (ii) subject to the limit for one person, a limit of $50,000 due to bodily injury or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and (iii) a limit of $20,000 due to injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The amount of bodily injury or property damage liability coverage available for payment from any source shall be credited against and reduce the amount of protection otherwise available against an underinsured motorist. Nothing herein shall preclude any self-insurer operator from purchasing or providing uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance coverage in an amount greater than required in this subsection. Such protection against uninsured and underinsured motorists shall be secondary coverage to any other valid and collectible insurance providing the same protection that is available to any person otherwise entitled to assert a claim to such protection by virtue of this section.
