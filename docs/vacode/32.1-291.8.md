A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection G and subject to subsection F, in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor, a person other than the donor is barred from making, amending, or revoking an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part if the donor made an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.5/) or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.6/).

B. A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.6/) is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in § [32.1-291.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.4/) or [32.1-291.9](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.9/) from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.5/) or [32.1-291.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.10/).

If a person other than the donor makes an unrevoked anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.5/) or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.6/), another person may not make, amend, or revoke the gift of the donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.10/).

A revocation of an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part under § [32.1-291.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.6/) by a person other than the donor does not bar another person from making an anatomical gift of the body or part under § [32.1-291.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.5/) or [32.1-291.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.10/).

In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under § [32.1-291.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.4/), an anatomical gift of a part is neither a refusal to give another part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another part at a later time by the donor or another person.

F. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under § [32.1-291.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.4/), an anatomical gift of a part for one or more of the purposes set forth in § [32.1-291.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.4/) is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under § [32.1-291.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.5/) or [32.1-291.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-291.10/).

H. If an unemancipated minor who signed a refusal dies, a parent of the minor who is reasonably available may revoke the minor's refusal.
