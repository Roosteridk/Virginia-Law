# ยง 3.2-3620 Seizure and condemnation.

The Commissioner may seize any lot of regulated product not in compliance with this chapter. The Commissioner may make application for seizure to an appropriate court in the city or county where such regulated product is located. In the event that the court finds such regulated product to be in violation of this chapter, and orders the condemnation of such regulated product, the owner of the regulated product shall dispose of the seized regulated product in any manner that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is consistent with the quality of the regulated product, and that complies with the laws of the Commonwealth. In no instance shall the court order the disposition of such regulated product without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the regulated product, or for permission to process or relabel the regulated product, to bring it into compliance with this chapter.
