# § 8.9A-325 Priority of security interests in transferred collateral.

(a) Subordination of security interest in transferred collateral. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a security interest created by a debtor is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral created by another person if:

(1) the debtor acquired the collateral subject to the security interest created by the other person;

(2) the security interest created by the other person was perfected when the debtor acquired the collateral; and

(3) there is no period thereafter when the security interest is unperfected.

(b) Limitation of subsection (a) subordination. Subsection (a) subordinates a security interest only if the security interest:

(1) otherwise would have priority solely under § [8.9A-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-322/) (a) or § [8.9A-324](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-324/); or

(2) arose solely under § [8.2-711](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2-711/) (3) or § [8.2A-508](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-508/) (5).
