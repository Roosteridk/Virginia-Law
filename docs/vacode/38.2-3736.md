# ยง 38.2-3736 Noncontributory coverage.

If no specific charge is made to the debtor for credit life or credit accident and sickness insurance, the Commission is granted discretion in applying the provisions of this chapter. Each company must comply with ยง [38.2-3725](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3725/) and the filing letter must specifically request an exemption from Virginia law. For purposes of this section, it will be considered that the debtor is charged a specific amount for insurance if an identifiable charge for insurance is disclosed in the credit or other instrument furnished the debtor which sets out the financial elements of the credit transactions, or if there is a differential in finance, interest, service or other similar charges made to debtors who are in like circumstances, except for their insured or noninsured status.

1992, c. 586.
