# ยง 6.2-1173 Powers of attorney on accounts.

Any savings institution may continue to recognize the authority of an attorney-in-fact authorized in writing to manage or to make withdrawals, either in whole or in part, from any account until it receives written notice or is on actual notice of the revocation of his authority. For the purposes of this section, written notice of death of the owner of the account shall constitute written notice of revocation of the authority of his attorney. Written notice of the adjudication of incapacity of an account owner shall constitute written notice of revocation of the authority of his attorney unless under the laws of the Commonwealth the authority of the attorney-in-fact survives such adjudication. Payment of the account in accordance with the provisions of this section shall constitute a full discharge and acquittance of the association as to such account.
