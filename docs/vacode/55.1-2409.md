# ยง 55.1-2409 Proceedings to claim land escheated.

When the verdict on an inquest is for the Commonwealth, any person claiming any interest in the lands, whether legal or equitable, may, before the sale of such land, petition the circuit court for redress. The petition shall be accompanied by a bond with good security to pay the Commonwealth all past due real estate taxes, penalties, and interest on such lands. The escheator shall be the sole defendant on behalf of the Commonwealth, and may appear on his own behalf. The escheator shall file an answer stating the objections to the claim. The cause shall be heard, without any unnecessary delay, upon the petition and answer and the evidence. Upon a judgment in favor of the claimant, he shall pay all past due taxes, penalties, and interest. Upon entry of such judgment, the court may award attorney fees to the escheator. For real estate assessment purposes, the commissioner of the revenue or assessor shall continue to assess any escheated property.
