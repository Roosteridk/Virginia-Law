1. Deny coverage to a covered person solely on the basis of the person's disability;

3. Penalize a health care provider, reduce or limit the reimbursement of a health care provider, or provide monetary or nonmonetary incentives to a health care provider to induce such health care provider to act in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of § [32.1-297.2](/vacode/32.1-297.2/); or

4. Reduce or limit coverage for services related to organ, eye, or tissue transplant as defined in § [32.1-297.2](/vacode/32.1-297.2/) for an eligible individual with a disability as defined in § [32.1-297.2](/vacode/32.1-297.2/).

B. The provisions of this section shall apply to any policy, contract, or plan delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in the Commonwealth on and after January 1, 2021.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to short-term travel, accident-only, or limited or specified disease policies; contracts designed for issuance to persons eligible for coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as Medicare, or any other similar coverage under state or federal government plans; or short-term nonrenewable policies of not more than six months' duration.
