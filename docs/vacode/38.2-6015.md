A. No cause of action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the Commission, the Commissioner of Insurance, or any of the Commission's employees or agents, for any statements made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this chapter or Article 6.1 (ยง [38.2-1865.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1865.1/) et seq.) of Chapter 18 of this title.

B. No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the Commission, if the act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive.

C. No civil liability shall be imposed on and no cause of action shall arise from a person's furnishing information concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent viatical settlement acts or suspected or completed fraudulent insurance acts, if the information is provided to or received from:

1. The Commission, the Commissioner of Insurance, or any of the Commission's employees or agents;

2. Federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory officials or their employees, agents or representatives;

3. A person involved in the prevention and detection of fraudulent viatical settlement acts or that person's agents, employees, or representatives;

D. Immunity provided by subsection C shall not apply to statements made with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent viatical settlement act or a fraudulent insurance act, the party bringing the action shall plead specifically any allegation that subsection C does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.

G. Subsection F does not prohibit release by the Commission of documents and evidence obtained in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical settlement acts:

1. In administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce laws administered by the Commission;

2. To federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent viatical settlement acts or to the NAIC; or

3. At the discretion of the Commission, to a person in the business of viatical settlements that is aggrieved by a fraudulent viatical settlement act.
