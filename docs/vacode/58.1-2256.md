# ยง 58.1-2256 Deductions and discounts for providers of alternative fuel filing returns.

A. When a provider of alternative fuel files a return, the provider of alternative fuel may deduct from the amount of tax payable with the return the amount of tax any of the following licensees owes the provider of alternative fuel but failed to remit to the provider of alternative fuel:

1. A licensed bulk user of alternative fuel who has posted a bond in accordance with ยง [58.1-2246](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2246/); and

2. A licensed retailer of alternative fuel who has posted a bond in accordance with ยง [58.1-2246](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2246/).

A provider of alternative fuel shall not be liable for tax that such a licensee owes the provider of alternative fuel but fails to pay. If such licensee pays the tax owed to a provider of alternative fuel after the provider of alternative fuel deducts the amount of such tax on a return, the provider of alternative fuel shall remit the payment to the Commissioner with the next monthly return filed subsequent to receipt of the tax.

B. A provider of alternative fuel who timely files a return with the payment due may deduct, from the amount of tax payable with the return, an administrative discount of one-tenth of one percent of the amount of tax payable to this Commonwealth, not to exceed a total of $5,000 per month. The administrative discount allowed a provider of alternative fuel who is also licensed as a supplier under Article 2 (ยง [58.1-2204](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2204/) et seq.) of this chapter shall not exceed $5,000 per month for both licenses.
