# ยง 2.2-1826 Issuance of replacement warrants generally.

Upon satisfactory proof presented to the Comptroller or to the State Treasurer that any warrant drawn by either the Comptroller or the State Treasurer, or by a predecessor, upon the state treasury has been lost or destroyed before having been paid, the Comptroller or State Treasurer who issued, or from whose office was issued, the original warrant shall issue a replacement of the original warrant. The Comptroller or the State Treasurer may require a bond to be executed, with such security as is approved by him, payable to the Commonwealth, in the amount of the warrant and conditioned to save harmless the Commonwealth from any loss occasioned by issuing the replacement warrant. Every replacement warrant shall show upon its face that it is a replacement.

In the discretion of the State Treasurer, state warrants in payment and redemption of previously lost or otherwise unpaid warrants may be issued directly to the person entitled to the money as the owner, heir, legatee, or as fiduciary of the estate of the deceased owner, heir, or legatee, and in such cases shall not be issued to a named attorney-in-fact, agent, assignee, or any other person regardless of a written instruction to the contrary. In such circumstances, the State Treasurer may refuse to recognize and is not bound by any terms of a power of attorney or assignment that may be presented as having been executed by a person as the purported owner, heir, legatee or fiduciary of the estate of a deceased owner of such warrants.
