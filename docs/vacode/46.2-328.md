# § 46.2-328 Department to issue licenses; endorsements, classifications, and restrictions authorizing operation of certain vehicles.

A. The Department shall issue to every person licensed as a driver a driver's license. Every driver's license shall contain all appropriate endorsements, classifications, and restrictions, where applicable, if the licensee has been licensed:

1. To operate a motorcycle as defined in § [46.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-100/);

2. To operate a school bus as defined in § [46.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-100/);

3. To operate a commercial motor vehicle pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Commercial Driver's License Act (§ [46.2-341.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.1/) et seq.); or

4. To operate a passenger car as defined in § [46.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-100/).

B. Every applicant intending to operate one or more of the motor vehicles described in subsection A, when applying for a driver's license, shall state in his application the classification of each vehicle that he intends to operate and for which he seeks to be licensed and submit to and pass the examination provided for in § [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/) and, if applicable, §§ [46.2-337](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-337/) and [46.2-341.14](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.14/), using the type of each vehicle for which he seeks to be licensed.

C. Every applicant intending to drive a motorcycle, when applying for a classification to authorize the driving of a motorcycle, shall submit to and pass the examination provided for in § [46.2-337](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-337/). A classification on any license to drive a motorcycle shall indicate that the license is classified for the purpose of authorizing the licensee to drive only motorcycles and shall indicate as applicable a further restriction to a two-wheeled motorcycle only or a three-wheeled motorcycle only. However, if the applicant has a valid license at the time of application for a classification to drive a motorcycle, or if the applicant, at the time of such application, applies for a regular driver's license and submits to and passes the examination provided for in § [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/), he shall be granted a classification on his license to drive motorcycles based on the applicable restrictions, in addition to any other vehicles his driver's license or commercial driver's license may authorize him to operate.

A valid Virginia driver's license issued to a person 19 years of age or older shall constitute a driver's license with a temporary motorcycle classification for the purposes of driving a motorcycle if the driver's license is accompanied by either (i) documentation verifying his successful completion of a motorcycle rider safety training course offered by a provider licensed under Article 23 (§ [46.2-1188](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1188/) et seq.) of Chapter 10 or (ii) documentation that the license holder is a member, the spouse of a member, or a dependent of a member of the United States Armed Services and that the license holder has successfully completed a basic motorcycle rider course approved by the United States Armed Services. The temporary motorcycle classification shall only be valid for 30 days from the date of successful completion of the motorcycle rider safety training course as shown on the documentation evidencing completion of such course. The temporary motorcycle classification shall indicate whether the license holder is authorized to operate any motorcycle or is restricted to either a two-wheeled motorcycle only or a three-wheeled motorcycle only.

Any person who holds a valid Virginia driver's license and is a member, the spouse of a member, or a dependent of a member of the United States Armed Services shall be issued a motorcycle classification by mail upon documentation of (a) successful completion of a basic motorcycle rider course approved by the United States Armed Services and (b) documentation of his assignment outside the Commonwealth.

D. The Department may make any changes in the classifications and endorsements during the validity of the license as may be appropriate.

E. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to persons applying for learner's permits as otherwise provided for in this title.

F. Every person issued a driver's license or commercial driver's license who drives any motor vehicle of the classifications in this section and whose driver's license does not carry an endorsement or indication that the licensee is licensed as provided in this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
