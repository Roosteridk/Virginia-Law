a. That disbursements of purchasers' funds may be made from time to time to pay for construction of the cooperative, architectural, and engineering costs, finance and legal fees, and other costs for the completion of the cooperative in proportion to the value of the work completed by the contractor as certified by an independent, registered architect or engineer, on bills submitted and approved by the lender of construction funds or the escrow agent;

b. That disbursement of the balance of purchasers' funds remaining after completion of the cooperative shall be made only when the escrow agent or lender receives satisfactory evidence that the period for filing mechanic's and materialman's liens has expired, or that the right to claim those liens has been waived, or that adequate provision has been made for satisfaction of any claimed mechanic's or materialman's lien; and

c. Any other restriction relative to the retention and disbursement of purchasers' funds required by the Common Interest Community Board; and

8. Any other materials or information the agency may require by its regulations.
