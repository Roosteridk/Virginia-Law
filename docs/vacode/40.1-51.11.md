Each suspension of an inspection certificate shall continue in effect until such boiler or pressure vessel shall have been made to conform to the rules and regulations of the Board, and until such inspection certificate shall have been reinstated. No boiler or pressure vessel shall be operated during the period of suspension.

B.
