# § 38.2-2018 Person aggrieved by application of rating system to be heard; appeal to Commission.

Each rate service organization and each insurer subject to this chapter that makes its own rates shall provide within this Commonwealth reasonable means whereby any person aggrieved by the application of its rating system may, after written request, be heard in person or by an authorized representative to review the manner in which the rating system has been applied to the insurance afforded him. If the rate service organization or insurer fails to grant or reject the request within thirty days after it is made, the applicant may proceed in the same manner as if his application had been rejected. Any person affected by the action of the rate service organization or the insurer on such request may, within thirty days after written notice of the action, appeal to the Commission. The Commission may affirm or reverse the action after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to the rate service organization or insurer.
