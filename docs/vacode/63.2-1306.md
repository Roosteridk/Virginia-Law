# § 63.2-1306 State-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program.

A. The State-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program is established to facilitate placements with relatives and ensure permanency for children in foster care. Kinship guardianship assistance payments may include state-funded maintenance payments made pursuant to this section.

B. A child is eligible for kinship guardianship assistance under the program if:

1. The child has been removed from his home pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement or as a result of a judicial determination that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child;

2. The child has been in the custody of the local department for at least 90 days;

3. The child demonstrates a strong attachment to the prospective kinship guardian, and the prospective kinship guardian has a strong commitment to caring permanently for the child;

4. The child has been consulted regarding the kinship guardianship if the child is 14 years of age or older;

5. The requirements for a transfer of custody of the child to the prospective kinship guardian for the purpose of establishing eligibility for the State-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program set forth in subsection A1 of § [16.1-282.1](/vacode/16.1-282.1/) have been met; and

6. The child is not eligible for the Federal-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program set forth in § [63.2-1305](/vacode/63.2-1305/).

C. If a child does not meet the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection B but has a sibling who meets such criteria, the child may be placed in the same kinship guardianship with his eligible sibling if the local department and kinship guardian agree that such placement is appropriate. In such cases, kinship guardianship assistance may be paid on behalf of each sibling so placed.

D. A prospective kinship guardian is eligible for kinship guardianship assistance under the program if he:

1. Completes the relative foster home approval process; or

2. Qualifies for a waiver from one or more components of such process pursuant to Board regulations, completes a background check and has not been convicted of any barrier crime as outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(20), and completes a home study in accordance with § [63.2-904](/vacode/63.2-904/).

E. In order to receive payments pursuant to the Children's Services Act (§ [2.2-5200](/vacode/2.2-5200/) et seq.), the local department and the prospective kinship guardian of a child who meets the requirements of subsection B shall enter into a written kinship guardianship assistance agreement with the Department and containing terms providing for the following:

1. The amount of each kinship guardianship assistance payment, the manner in which such payments will be provided, and the manner in which such payments may be adjusted periodically, in consultation with the kinship guardian, on the basis of the circumstances of the kinship guardian and the needs of the child; and

2. Assurance that the agreement shall remain in effect without regard to the state of residency of the kinship guardian.

F. For purposes of this section, "relative" means an adult who is (i) related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption or (ii) fictive kin of the child.
