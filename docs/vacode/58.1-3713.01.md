# ยง 58.1-3713.01 Distribution of local coal and gas road improvement taxes for water and sewer projects applicable to the additional one-fourth allocation.

The governing body of any county or city imposing a local gas road improvement tax under subsection A of ยง [58.1-3713](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3713/) or a local coal road improvement severance license tax under subsection B of ยง [58.1-3741](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3741/) that is using an additional one-fourth of the revenue from such tax to fund the construction of new water or sewer systems or lines or the repair or enhancement of existing water systems or lines shall develop and adopt by resolution an annual plan for such water and/or sewer projects and an annual plan for the funding of such water and/or sewer projects in areas in its county or city where natural water supplies are insufficient from the standpoint of quality or quantity. Plans shall establish a priority for funding water and/or sewer projects in such city or county. Consideration for funding shall be given to (i) replacing water supplies lost due to mining activities and providing emergency water services to areas that have lost water due to mining activities; (ii) preserving water supplies that are jeopardized due to permitted mining which is occurring or is near commencement; (iii) facilitating development of water and/or sewer projects which will promote diversified industrial development; and (iv) increasing the capacity of publicly owned water and/or sewer treatment or supply facilities.

Plans shall encourage the development of regional water and/or sewer projects. "Regional water and/or sewer project" means a project involving two or more public water and/or sewer service providers located in the same or neighboring political subdivisions. In order to promote cost savings and economic development, funding may be provided for regional water and/or sewer projects as provided in this section. If a regional water and/or sewer project encompasses an area for which plans are developed by two or more local governing bodies, the project shall not be funded unless it is agreed to by all of the affected local governing bodies.

A county or city shall not expend local coal and gas road improvement tax revenue for water and/or sewer projects in a manner that is inconsistent with the priority for funding set forth in an approved plan.
