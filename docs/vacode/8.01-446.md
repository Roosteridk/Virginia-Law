# § 8.01-446 Clerks to keep judgment dockets; what judgments to be docketed therein.

The clerk of each court of every circuit shall keep in his office, in a well-bound book, or by microphotographic or electronic process allowed by § [17.1-240](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-240/), a judgment docket, in which he shall docket, without delay, any judgment for a specific amount of money rendered in his court, and shall likewise docket without delay any judgment for a specific amount of money rendered in this Commonwealth by any other court of this Commonwealth or federal court, when he shall be required so to do by any person interested, on such person delivering to him an authenticated legible abstract of it and also upon the request of any person interested therein, any such judgment rendered by a district court judge whose book has been filed in his office under the provisions of Title 16.1 or of which a legible abstract is delivered to him certified by the district court judge who rendered it; provided, that judgments docketed in the clerk's office of the Circuit Court of the City of Williamsburg and the County of James City shall be docketed and indexed in one book. A specific judgment for money shall state that it is a judgment for money in a specific amount in favor of a named party, against a named party, with that party's address, if known, and it shall further state the time from which the judgment bears interest. An order of restitution docketed pursuant to § [19.2-305.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-305.2/) shall have the same force and effect as a specific judgment for money and shall state that it is an order of restitution in a specific amount in favor of a named party, against a named party, with that party's address, if known, and it shall further state the time from which the judgment bears interest. If the clerk determines that an abstract is not legible, the clerk shall refuse to record it and shall return it to the person who tendered the abstract for recording. No judgment for assessments described in subsection A of § [17.1-275.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.5/) or for the fees provided for by § [17.1-275.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.1/), [17.1-275.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.2/), [17.1-275.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.3/), [17.1-275.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.4/), [17.1-275.7](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.7/), [17.1-275.8](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.8/), [17.1-275.9](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.9/), [17.1-275.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.10/), [17.1-275.11](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.11/), [17.1-275.11:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.11:1/), or [17.1-275.12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-275.12/) or for all other fines and costs shall be recorded as a judgment in favor of the Commonwealth if such fees, assessments, fines, or costs have been fully paid by the defendant by the date of sentencing by the court.
