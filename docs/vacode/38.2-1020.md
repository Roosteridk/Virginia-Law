# ยง 38.2-1020 Transfer of domicile from Virginia to another state.

Any domestic insurer, upon the approval of the Commission, may transfer its domicile from this Commonwealth to any other state in which it is licensed to transact the business of insurance. The Commission may approve the proposed transfer of domicile if it determines that the transfer is in the best interests of the insurer's policyholders and this Commonwealth. If the Commission does not approve the transfer, it shall give the insurer written notice of the refusal and the reasons for it within thirty days after the date the request for transfer was made. If the request for transfer is granted and the insurer is otherwise qualified, it may transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth as a foreign insurer without interruption in licensing.
