# ยง 64.2-523 Personal representative may execute deed pursuant to written contract of decedent.

When any decedent has executed and delivered a bona fide written contract of sale, purchase option, or other agreement binding such deceased person, his heirs, personal representatives, or assigns, to convey any real property or any interest therein, his personal representatives may execute a deed and do all things necessary to effect the transfer of title to such real property or any interest therein to the purchaser upon the purchaser's full compliance with the terms and conditions of such contract, option, or agreement. Such transfer shall be as effective as if it had been made by the decedent. The contract, option, or agreement shall be attached to any deed executed by a personal representative pursuant to this section and the clerk shall record such contract, option, or agreement in the deed book. Any personal representative duly qualified in any other state, upon taking an oath that the decedent owed no debts in the Commonwealth and posting bond upon such terms and in such amount as may be fixed by the clerk, but not less than the value of the decedent's interest to be conveyed, may convey real property or any interest therein under the provisions of this section without qualifying in the Commonwealth.
