# ยง 38.2-1005.1:2 Formation of mutual holding company and conversion of mutual company.

A mutual company, upon approval of the Commission, may reorganize by forming a mutual holding company and continue the corporate existence of the reorganizing mutual company as a stock insurance company in accordance with the provisions of this article. At the time a plan of MHC conversion becomes effective and without any further action:

1. The mutual company shall become a stock corporation, the membership interests of the policyholders in the mutual company shall be deemed extinguished and all eligible members of the mutual company shall become members of the mutual holding company in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual holding company and the applicable provisions of this article and Chapter 10 (ยง [38.2-1000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1000/) et seq.) of this title; and

2. All of the shares of capital stock of the converted company shall be issued to the mutual holding company that, at all times thereafter, shall own not less than a majority of the issued shares of the voting stock of the converted company; however, either at the time the conversion becomes effective or, with the Commission's approval, at any later time, the voting shares of the converted company may be held by one or more intermediate holding companies so long as the mutual holding company at all times owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting shares of the converted company.
