Any beneficiary, disabled person or eligible spouse or eligible dependent of a deceased or disabled person aggrieved by the decision of VRS may appeal the decision through a process established by VRS. Any such process may utilize a medical board as described in § [51.1-124.23](/vacode/51.1-124.23/), provided that for any medical review conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, each member of such medical board shall be a licensed health practitioner, as defined in § [9.1-404](/vacode/9.1-404/). An employer may submit information related to the claim and may participate in any informal fact-finding proceeding that is included in such process established by VRS. Upon completion of the appeal process, the final determination issued by VRS shall constitute a case decision as defined in § [2.2-4001](/vacode/2.2-4001/). Any beneficiary, disabled person, or eligible spouse or eligible dependent of a deceased or disabled person aggrieved by, and claiming the unlawfulness of, such case decision shall have a right to seek judicial review thereof in accordance with Article 5 (§ [2.2-4025](/vacode/2.2-4025/) et seq.) of the Administrative Process Act.
