# § 38.2-2504 Property beyond authorized territory.

A mutual assessment property and casualty insurer shall not insure real property outside the limits of the territory for which it is authorized to write insurance as specified in its charter or bylaws. However, members may be provided liability or other insurance on risks other than real property insurable under this chapter, wherever located. When members own real property near the border of the territory which extends in a contiguous manner beyond the territory, all of the property may be insured if otherwise insurable under this chapter, whether the property is within or without the territory.
