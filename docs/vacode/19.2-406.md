# ยง 19.2-406 Bail pending pretrial appeal.

This section applies only to pretrial appeals. Upon a pretrial appeal being taken by the Commonwealth pursuant to ยง [19.2-398](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-398/), if the defendant moves the trial court for release on bail, that court shall promptly, but in no event later than three days after the Commonwealth's notice of appeal is filed, hold a hearing to determine the issue of bail. The burden shall be upon the Commonwealth to show good cause why the bail should not be reduced or the accused released on his own recognizance. If it is determined that the accused shall be released on bail, bail shall be set and determined in accordance with Article 1 (ยง [19.2-119](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-119/) et seq.) of Chapter 9 of this title.
