# ยง 22.1-289.014 Variances.

The Superintendent may grant a variance to a regulation when the Superintendent determines that (i) a licensee or applicant for licensure as a child day program or family day system has demonstrated that the implementation of a regulation would impose a substantial financial or programmatic hardship and (ii) the variance would not adversely affect the safety and well-being of children in care. The Superintendent shall review each allowable variance at least annually. At a minimum, this review shall address the impact of the allowable variance on persons in care, adherence by the licensee to any conditions attached, and the continuing need for the allowable variance.
