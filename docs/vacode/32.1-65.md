# § 32.1-65 Certain newborn screening required.

In order to prevent intellectual disability and permanent disability or death, every infant who is born in the Commonwealth shall be subjected to screening tests for various disorders consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, the uniform condition panel recommended by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children.

Any infant whose parent or guardian objects thereto on the grounds that such tests conflict with his religious practices or tenets shall not be required to receive such screening tests.

The physician or certified nurse midwife in charge of the infant's care after delivery shall cause such tests to be performed. The screening tests shall be performed by the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services or any other laboratory the Department of Health has contracted with to provide such service. Screening tests for time-critical disorders identified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children shall be performed seven days a week.

The program for screening infants for sickle cell diseases shall be conducted in addition to the programs provided for in Article 8 (§ [32.1-68](/vacode/32.1-68/) et seq.).
