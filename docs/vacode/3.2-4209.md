# § 3.2-4209 Reporting of information.

A. Not later than 20 days after the end of each calendar quarter, and more frequently if so directed by the Commissioner, each stamping agent shall submit to the Attorney General such information as the Attorney General requires to facilitate compliance with this article, including, but not limited to, a list by brand family of the total number of cigarettes for which the stamping agent affixed stamps during the previous calendar quarter or otherwise paid the tax due for such cigarettes. The Attorney General may allow such information to be filed electronically. For roll-your-own tobacco, in lieu of the number of cigarettes sold, the Attorney General shall require that the stamping agent submit the total quantity in ounces, by brand family, of all such roll-your-own tobacco in accordance with the invoice accompanying each shipment he initiates, as provided in subsection D of § [58.1-1003.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1003.2/), or for which the stamping agent otherwise paid the tax due for such roll-your-own tobacco. The stamping agent shall maintain, and make available to the Commissioner and Attorney General, all invoices and documentation of sales of all nonparticipating manufacturer cigarettes and any other information relied upon in reporting to the Attorney General for a period of five years.

B. In addition to the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection A or any other provision of law, the Attorney General may require a stamping agent, distributor or tobacco product manufacturer to submit any additional information including, but not limited to, samples of the packaging or labeling of each brand family, as is necessary to enable the Attorney General to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer has complied, is in compliance, and will continue in compliance with this article and Article 1 (§ [3.2-4200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/) et seq.) of this chapter.

C. On a quarterly basis, and upon request made in writing by a tobacco product manufacturer, a stamping agent shall provide to the requesting tobacco product manufacturer the total number of cigarettes, by brand family, which the stamping agent reported to the Attorney General pursuant to subsection A, provided that such information provided by the stamping agent to a tobacco manufacturer shall be limited to the brand families of that manufacturer as listed in the Directory established pursuant to § [3.2-4206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4206/). A stamping agent receiving a request pursuant to this subsection shall provide the requested information within 30 days from receipt of the request.
