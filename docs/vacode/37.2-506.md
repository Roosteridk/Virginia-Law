If any applicant is denied employment because of information appearing on his criminal history record and the applicant disputes the information upon which the denial was based, the Central Criminal Records Exchange shall, upon written request, furnish to the applicant the procedures for obtaining a copy of the criminal history record from the FBI. The information provided to the executive director or personnel director of any community services board shall not be disseminated except as provided in this section.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, the community services board may hire for compensated employment or permit any person under contract to serve in a direct care position on behalf of the community services board or permit any person employed by a temporary agency that has entered into a contract with the community services board to provide direct care services on behalf of the community services board at adult substance abuse or adult mental health treatment programs a person who was convicted of any violation of § [18.2-51.3](/vacode/18.2-51.3/); any misdemeanor violation of § [18.2-56](/vacode/18.2-56/) or [18.2-56.1](/vacode/18.2-56.1/), subsection A of § [18.2-57](/vacode/18.2-57/), or § [18.2-57.2](/vacode/18.2-57.2/); any violation of § [18.2-60](/vacode/18.2-60/), [18.2-89](/vacode/18.2-89/), [18.2-92](/vacode/18.2-92/), or [18.2-94](/vacode/18.2-94/); any misdemeanor violation of § [18.2-282](/vacode/18.2-282/), [18.2-346](/vacode/18.2-346/), or [18.2-346.01](/vacode/18.2-346.01/); any offense set forth in clause (iii) of the definition of barrier crime in § [19.2-392.02](/vacode/19.2-392.02/), except an offense pursuant to subsection H1 or H2 of § [18.2-248](/vacode/18.2-248/); or any substantially similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction, if the hiring community services board determines, based upon a screening assessment, that the criminal behavior was substantially related to the applicant's substance abuse or mental illness and that the person has been successfully rehabilitated and is not a risk to individuals receiving services based on his criminal history background and his substance abuse or mental illness history.

E. The community services board and a screening contractor designated by the Department shall screen applicants who meet the criteria set forth in subsections C and D to assess whether the applicants have been rehabilitated successfully and are not a risk to individuals receiving services based on their criminal history backgrounds and substance abuse or mental illness histories.

The cost of this screening shall be paid by the applicant, unless the board decides to pay the cost.

F. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, a community services board may (i) hire for compensated employment, (ii) approve as a sponsored residential service provider, (iii) permit to enter into a shared living arrangement, or (iv) permit any person under contract to serve in a direct care position on behalf of the community services board or permit any person employed by a temporary agency that has entered into a contract with the community services board to provide direct care services on behalf of the community services board persons who have been convicted of not more than one misdemeanor offense under § [18.2-57](/vacode/18.2-57/) or [18.2-57.2](/vacode/18.2-57.2/), or any substantially similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction, if 10 years have elapsed following the conviction, unless the person committed the offense while employed in a direct care position. A community services board may also approve a person as a sponsored residential service provider if (a) any adult living in the home of an applicant or (b) any person employed by the applicant to provide services in the home in which sponsored residential services are provided has been convicted of not more than one misdemeanor offense under § [18.2-57](/vacode/18.2-57/) or [18.2-57.2](/vacode/18.2-57.2/), or any substantially similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction, if 10 years have elapsed following the conviction, unless the person committed the offense while employed in a direct care position.

G. Community services boards also shall require, as a condition of employment, approval as a sponsored residential service provider, permission to enter into a shared living arrangement with a person receiving medical assistance services pursuant to a waiver, or permission for any person under contract to serve in a direct care position on behalf of the community services board, written consent and personal information necessary to obtain a search of the registry of founded complaints of child abuse and neglect that is maintained by the Department of Social Services pursuant to § [63.2-1515](/vacode/63.2-1515/).

H. The cost of obtaining the criminal history record and search of the child abuse and neglect registry record shall be borne by the applicant, unless the community services board decides to pay the cost.

1. A criminal history records check through the Central Criminal Records Exchange pursuant to § [19.2-389](/vacode/19.2-389/); and

2. A search of the central registry maintained pursuant to § [63.2-1515](/vacode/63.2-1515/) for any founded complaint of child abuse and neglect.
