# ยง 25.1-410 Replacement housing for tenants.

A. In addition to amounts otherwise authorized by this article, a state agency shall make a payment to or for any displaced person displaced from any dwelling not eligible to receive a payment under ยง [25.1-409](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-409/) which dwelling was actually and lawfully occupied by such displaced person for not less than 90 days immediately prior to (i) the initiation of negotiations for acquisition of the dwelling or (ii) if the displacement is not a direct result of acquisition, such other event as the state agency shall prescribe. Such payment shall consist of the amount necessary to enable such displaced person to lease or rent, for a period not to exceed 42 months, a comparable replacement dwelling, but not to exceed $7,200. At the discretion of the state agency, a payment under this subsection may be made in periodic installments. Computation of a payment under this subsection to a low-income displaced person for a comparable replacement dwelling shall take into account such person's income.

B. Any person eligible for a payment under subsection A may elect to apply such payment to a down payment on, and other incidental expenses pursuant to, the purchase of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling. Any such person may, at the discretion of the state agency, be eligible under this subsection for the maximum payment allowed under subsection A.
