# § 6.2-1142 Conversion of federal financial institution into state savings institution or state bank.

A. A federal financial institution doing business in the Commonwealth may become a state savings institution, and such a federal financial institution that is a stock institution may become a state bank, as follows:

1. In either case, the federal financial institution shall take such action as will under federal law and regulations terminate its existence as a federal financial institution on a specified date;

2. In the case of a conversion to a state savings institution, the directors of the federal financial institution shall organize a corporation under this chapter and, if a stock institution, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-601](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-601/) et seq.), or if a mutual savings institution, the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-801](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-801/) et seq.), and the new corporation shall apply for a certificate of authority to do business under § [6.2-1118](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1118/); and

3. In the case of a conversion to a state bank, the directors of the federal financial institution shall organize a corporation under Chapter 8 (§ [6.2-800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-800/) et seq.) and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-601](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-601/) et seq.), and the new corporation shall apply for a certificate of authority to do business under § [6.2-816](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-816/). If the applicant meets the standards established by § [6.2-816](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-816/), the Commission may issue it a certificate of authority to begin a banking business. The order shall designate the main office of the federal financial institution as the main office of the resulting bank, and the resulting bank shall be permitted to operate all branch offices of the former federal financial institution. Within one year of the date of such a conversion, the resulting bank shall conform its assets and operations to the provisions of law regulating the operation of banks. The Commission may grant such resulting bank additional one-year periods, not to exceed a total of four additional years, in which to conform its assets and operations to the provisions of law regulating the operation of banks.

B. The former federal financial institution converting to a state savings institution or a state bank shall transact no business as a state savings institution or as a state bank other than that relating to its organization until its certificate of authority to do business has been granted and its dissolution as a federal financial institution has become effective.

C. As soon as the certificate of authority to do business has been granted and its dissolution as a federal financial institution has become effective, all the property of the federal financial institution shall by operation of law and without any further act or deed be vested in and become the property of the state savings institution or state bank. The state savings institution or state bank shall (i) have, hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the same was possessed, held or enjoyed by the federal financial institution and (ii) become, and continue to be, responsible for all the obligations, duties and agreements of the federal financial institution, including taxes and other liabilities created by law or incurred by it before becoming a state savings institution or state bank to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.

D. Upon conversion of a federal financial institution to a state savings bank, the state savings bank shall have the right to continue to operate all branch offices then in existence without having to obtain the approval of the Commission pursuant to § [6.2-1133](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1133/).
