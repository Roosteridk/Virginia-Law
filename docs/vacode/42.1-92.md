# ยง 42.1-92 Short title; policy.

A. This chapter may be cited as the "State Publications Depository Program."

B. By enacting this chapter, the General Assembly recognizes that an informed citizenry is indispensable to the proper functioning of a democratic society. In order to remain informed, citizens must know about the activities of their government and benefit from information developed at public expense. Through the administration of the State Publications Depository Program, citizens will be ensured continued access to state publications, regardless of geographical location in the Commonwealth. This chapter shall be enacted to ensure that The Library of Virginia, as the official repository of state publications for the Commonwealth, is able to provide continued access to all state government publications, regardless of physical form or characteristics, and to prescribe conditions for the collection and preservation of state publications throughout the Commonwealth. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter or diminish the responsibilities of public bodies with respect to public records under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (ยง [2.2-3700](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3700/) et seq.) or the Virginia Public Records Act (ยง [42.1-76](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/42.1-76/) et seq.).
