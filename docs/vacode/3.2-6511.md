# ยง 3.2-6511 Failure of dealer or pet shop to provide adequate care; penalty; report.

A. Any dealer or pet shop that fails to adequately house, feed, water, exercise or care for animals in his or its possession or custody as provided for under this chapter is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. Such animals shall be subject to seizure and impoundment, and upon conviction of such person the animals may be sold, euthanized, or disposed of as provided by ยง [3.2-6546](/vacode/3.2-6546/) for licensed, tagged, or tattooed animals. Such failure is also grounds for revocation of a permit or certificate of registration after public hearing. Any funds that result from such sale shall be used first to pay the costs of the local jurisdiction for the impoundment and disposition of the animals, and any funds remaining shall be paid to the owner, if known. If the owner is not found, the remaining funds shall be paid into the Literary Fund.

B. Each pet shop shall retain records indicating any time a dog or cat in its possession or custody dies or is euthanized. Such records shall be (i) maintained for a period of at least two years and (ii) provided to animal control officers and the Inspector.
