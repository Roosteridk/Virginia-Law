4. For the purpose of this subsection, if all covered expenses for a visit for outpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment apply toward any deductible required by a policy or contract, such visit shall not count toward the outpatient visit benefit maximum set forth in the policy or contract.

5. This subsection shall not apply to any excepted benefits policy as defined in § [38.2-3431](/vacode/38.2-3431/), nor to policies or contracts designed for issuance to persons eligible for coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as Medicare, or any other similar coverage under state or federal governmental plans.

E. The requirements of this section shall apply to all insurance policies and subscription contracts delivered, issued for delivery, reissued, renewed, or extended, or at any time when any term of the policy or contract is changed or any premium adjustment made.

G. The Bureau of Insurance, in consultation with health carriers providing coverage for mental health and substance use disorder benefits pursuant to this section, shall develop reporting requirements regarding denied claims, complaints, appeals, and network adequacy involving such coverage set forth in this section. By November 1 of each year, the Bureau shall compile the information for the preceding year into a report that ensures the confidentiality of individuals whose information has been reported and is written in nontechnical, readily understandable language. The Bureau shall include in the report a summary of all comparative analyses prepared by health carriers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-26(a)(8) that the Bureau requested during the reporting period. This summary shall include the Bureau's explanation of whether the analyses were accepted as compliant, rejected as noncompliant, or are in process of review. For analyses that were noncompliant, the report shall include the corrective actions that the Bureau required the health carrier to take to come into compliance. The Bureau shall make the report available to the public by, among such other means as the Bureau finds appropriate, posting the reports on the Bureau's website and submit the report to the House Committee on Commerce and Energy and the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor.
