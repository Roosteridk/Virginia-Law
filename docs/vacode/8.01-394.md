# § 8.01-394 How contents of any such lost record, etc., proved.

A. Any person desirous of proving the contents of any such book, record, or other paper as is mentioned in either § [8.01-392](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-392/) or § [8.01-393](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-393/), may file before the circuit court of the county or city in which such record, book, or other paper was a petition in writing, stating the nature of the record, book, or paper, the contents of which he desires to prove, and what persons may be affected by such proof. Thereupon the court shall appoint a time and place for proceeding on such petition, of which reasonable notice shall be given by him to all parties named in such petition, or interested in the proceedings, and to any others who shall be known to the court, or who shall claim to be so interested. If any party interested other than the petitioner, or who may be affected by the proof, be a person under a disability, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent his interest in the proceeding.

B. The evidence upon said petition shall be in writing and filed, and the court shall make such order in respect to such record, book, or other paper, or anything therein, as may be necessary to secure the benefits thereof to the parties interested, or such other order as may be proper in the case.

Before such court shall make such order, the petitioner shall cause to be served on the persons interested a notice in writing that he will apply for such order, in the manner provided by § [8.01-296](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-296/), at least ten days before such order is to be made; but if such persons, or any of them, do not reside in this Commonwealth, or after due diligence cannot be found therein, an order of publication may be issued as provided by §§ [8.01-316](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-316/) and [8.01-317](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-317/).
