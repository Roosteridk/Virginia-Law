A resale certificate update or a financial update may be requested as provided in § [55.1-1992](/vacode/55.1-1992/), as appropriate. The purchaser may cancel the contract (i) within three days after the date of the contract, or up to seven days if extended by the ratified real estate contract, if on or before the date that the purchaser signs the contract, the purchaser receives the resale certificate, is notified that the resale certificate will not be available, or receives a resale certificate that does not contain the information required by this subsection to be included in the resale certificate; (ii) within three days, or up to seven days if extended by the ratified real estate contract, after receiving the resale certificate if the resale certificate, notice that the resale certificate will not be available, or a resale certificate that does not contain the information required by this subsection to be included in the resale certificate is hand delivered, delivered by electronic means, or delivered by a commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt is obtained; or (iii) within six days, or up to 10 days if extended by the ratified real estate contract, after the postmark date if the resale certificate, notice that the resale certificate will not be available, or a resale certificate that does not contain the information required by this subsection to be included in the resale certificate is sent to the purchaser by United States mail. The purchaser may also cancel the contract at any time prior to settlement if the purchaser has not been notified that the resale certificate will not be available and the resale certificate is not delivered to the purchaser.

Notice of cancellation shall be provided to the unit owner or his agent by one of the following methods:

1. Hand delivery;

2. United States mail, postage prepaid, provided that the sender retains sufficient proof of mailing in the form of a certificate of service prepared by the sender confirming such mailing;
