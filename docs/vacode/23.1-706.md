A. In acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for the benefit of the Plan, the board, and any person, investment manager, or committee to whom the board delegates any of its investment authority, shall act as trustee and shall exercise the judgment of care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income and the probable safety of their capital.

If the annual accounting and audit required by ยง [23.1-710](/vacode/23.1-710/) reveal that there are insufficient funds to ensure the actuarial soundness of the Plan, the board may adjust the terms of subsequent prepaid tuition contracts, arrange refunds for current purchasers to ensure actuarial soundness, or take such other action the board deems appropriate.

B.

The board may retain property properly acquired without time limitation and without regard to its suitability for original purchase.

All provisions of this subsection shall also apply to the portion of the Plan assets attributable to savings trust account contributions and the earnings on such contributions.

C. The selection of services relating to the operation and administration of the Plan, including contracts or agreements for the management, purchase, or sale of authorized investments or actuarial, recordkeeping, or consulting services, are governed by the standard of care set forth in subsection A and are not subject to the provisions of the Virginia Public Procurement Act (ยง [2.2-4300](/vacode/2.2-4300/) et seq.).

D. No board member or person, investment manager, or committee to whom the board delegates any of its investment authority who acts in accordance with the standard of care set forth in subsection A shall be held personally liable for losses suffered by the Plan on investments made pursuant to this chapter.

E. To the extent necessary to lawfully administer the Plan and in order to comply with federal, state, and local tax reporting requirements, the Plan may obtain all necessary social security account or tax identification numbers and such other data as the Plan deems necessary for such purposes, whether from a contributor, a purchaser, or another state agency.

F. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the Plan's investment, by purchase or otherwise, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the Commonwealth or its agencies and instrumentalities.
