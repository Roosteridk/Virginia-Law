A. For the purpose of this section:

"Credit hour threshold" means 125 percent of the credit hours needed to satisfy the degree requirements for a specified undergraduate program.

"Surcharge" means an amount equal to 100 percent of the average cost of a student's education at the baccalaureate public institution of higher education that the student attends less tuition and mandatory educational and general fee charges assessed to a Virginia student who has not exceeded the credit hour threshold.

B. Virginia students who enroll for the first time at baccalaureate public institutions of higher education after August 1, 2006, shall be assessed a surcharge for each semester beginning in which the student continues to be enrolled after such student has reached the credit hour threshold.

C. In calculating the credit hour threshold, the following courses and credit hours shall be excluded: (i) remedial courses; (ii) transfer credits from another institution of higher education that do not meet degree requirements for general education courses or the student's chosen program of study; (iii) advanced placement or international baccalaureate credits that were obtained while in high school or another secondary school program; and (iv) dual enrollment, college-level credits obtained by the student prior to receiving a high school diploma.

D. The relevant baccalaureate public institution of higher education may waive the surcharge in accordance with guidelines and criteria established by the Council, which may include illness, disability, and active service in the Armed Forces of the United States.
