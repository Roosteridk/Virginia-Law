# § 58.1-400.1 Minimum tax on telecommunications companies.

A. A telecommunications company that is incorporated shall be subject to a minimum tax, instead of the corporate income tax imposed by § [58.1-400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-400/), at the applicable rate on its gross receipts for the calendar year which ends during the taxable year if the tax imposed by § [58.1-400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-400/) is less than the minimum tax imposed by this section. A telecommunications company that is organized as a limited liability company, partnership, corporation that has made an election under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, or other entity treated as a pass-through entity shall be subject to the minimum tax in the manner prescribed by regulation.

The minimum tax shall be imposed at the rate of 0.5 percent of gross receipts.

B. In the case of an income tax return for a period of less than twelve months, the minimum tax shall be based on the gross receipts for the calendar year which ends during the taxable period or, if none, the most recent calendar year which ended before the taxable period. The minimum tax shall be prorated by the number of months in the taxable period.

C. The State Corporation Commission shall certify to the Department for each tax year as defined in § [58.1-2600](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2600/) the name, address, and gross receipts for each telecommunications company. The Commission shall mail or otherwise deliver a copy of the certification to each affected telecommunications company.

"Gross receipts" means all revenue from business done within the Commonwealth, including the proportionate part of interstate revenue attributable to the Commonwealth if such inclusion will result in annual gross receipts exceeding $5 million, with the following deductions:
