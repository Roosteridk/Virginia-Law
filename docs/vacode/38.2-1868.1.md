# § 38.2-1868.1 Proof of compliance with continuing education requirements; waivers.

A. As used in this article:

"Proof of compliance" means all fees prescribed by the Board and all documents and forms specified by the Board for demonstrating completion of Board-approved continuing education courses relevant to the license held and for the required number of hours.

"Received by the Board or its administrator" means delivered into the possession of the Board or its administrator in a form and manner prescribed by the Board.

B. Each agent and public adjuster holding one or more licenses subject to the continuing education requirements of this article shall complete all continuing education course or waiver requirements and shall submit to the Board or its administrator proof of compliance with such requirements in the form and manner required by the Board biennially, based on the agent's or public adjuster's month and year of birth. An agent or public adjuster born in an even-numbered year shall complete all continuing education course or waiver requirements and shall submit proof of compliance by the end of the agent's or public adjuster's birth month in even-numbered years. An agent or public adjuster born in an odd-numbered year shall complete all continuing education course or waiver requirements and shall submit proof of compliance by the end of the agent's or public adjuster's birth month in odd-numbered years.

C. A licensed agent or public adjuster who is unable to comply with the continuing education requirements of this article due to military service or other extenuating circumstances, including long-term illness or incapacity may request a waiver of such requirements. Requests for waivers of continuing education requirements shall be made in a form and manner prescribed by the Board. An agent or public adjuster seeking a waiver of some or all of the continuing education requirements shall submit all documentation, forms, and fees specified by the Board so as to be received by the Board or its administrator no later than the last day of the two-year period set forth in subsection B and in §§ [38.2-1825.1](/vacode/38.2-1825.1/), [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), and [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/). After the two-year period, an agent or public adjuster who has failed to complete the continuing education requirements may request a waiver of the continuing education reinstatement requirements set forth in subsection E of § [38.2-1825.1](/vacode/38.2-1825.1/), subsection E of § [38.2-1840](/vacode/38.2-1840/), and subsection E of § [38.2-1845.8](/vacode/38.2-1845.8/) within the 12-month reinstatement period described therein. The Board shall approve or disapprove the waiver request within 30 days of receipt thereof and shall provide written notice of its decision to the waiver applicant within five days of rendering its decision. Any waiver granted pursuant to this subsection shall be valid only for the biennium for which waiver application was made.

D. All fees specified by the Board shall be nonrefundable once received by the Commission, the Board, or the Board's administrator, except that duplicate payments may be refunded.
