# ยง 5.1-2.17 Exemptions from taxes or assessments; payments to county or city in lieu of taxes.

The exercise of the powers granted by this chapter will be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and as the operation and maintenance of airport projects by the Board will constitute the performance of essential governmental functions. The Board shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any airport project or any property acquired or used by the Board under the provisions of this chapter or upon the income therefrom, and any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the Commonwealth; provided that the exemption hereby granted shall not be construed to extend to persons conducting on the premises of an airport businesses for which local or state taxes would otherwise be required. When the bonds or other obligations of the Board issued in connection with the acquisition, construction or improvement of an airport or air navigation facility have been paid, or at an earlier date if the Board deems it financially feasible, the Board shall enter into negotiations with the governing body of the political subdivision in which such airport or facility is located and may agree with such governing body on sums to be paid to the county or city in lieu of taxes. In case of disagreement as to the value of the property, an appeal shall lie to the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which the airport or facility is located which court shall determine the value of such property and the ratio of assessed to true values of property in such political subdivision.
