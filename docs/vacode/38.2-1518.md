# ยง 38.2-1518 Rehabilitation or mutualization of companies.

If at any time the Commission acting as the receiver finds that it is in the best interests of the policyholders and creditors of a delinquent insurer that it be rehabilitated or mutualized, the Commission shall prepare a plan of rehabilitation or mutualization. If at any time a receiver, other than the Commission, of a delinquent insurer reports to the court that it is in the best interests of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer that it be rehabilitated or mutualized, the receiver shall submit a plan of rehabilitation or mutualization to the court for its approval. The plan may include a provision imposing liens upon the net equities of policyholders of the insurer, and in the case of life insurers, a provision imposing a moratorium upon the loan or cash surrender values of the policies for whatever period of time is necessary. A hearing on the plan shall be held and notice of the hearing given in a manner prescribed by either the Commission or the court. After the hearing, the plan may be approved, disapproved, or modified by the Commission or the court.
