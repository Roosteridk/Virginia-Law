# ยง 32.1-331.03 Process for payment directly to nursing facility or ICF/MR.

The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall, to the extent permitted by federal law, implement a process for payment of the nursing facility or ICF/MR share of payments directly to the nursing facility or ICF/MR rather than to the hospice care provider for hospice services furnished to an individual who is a resident of a nursing facility or ICF/MR and who would be eligible under the Commonwealth's program of medical assistance for nursing facility services or services in an ICF/MR had he not elected hospice care. Payments made directly to a nursing facility or ICF/MR shall be the full amount that would be paid to the nursing facility or ICF/MR if the individual was not receiving hospice services, and shall not reflect any discount to such rates.
