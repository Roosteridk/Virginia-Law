# ยง 22.1-289.042 Establishment of toll-free telephone line for complaints; investigation on receipt of complaints.

With such funds as are appropriated for this purpose, the Superintendent shall establish a toll-free telephone line to respond to complaints regarding operations of child day programs or family day systems. Upon receipt of a complaint concerning the operation of a child day program or family day system, regardless of whether the program is subject to licensure, the Superintendent shall, for good cause shown, cause an investigation to be made, including on-site visits as he deems necessary, of the activities, services, records, and facilities. The child day program or family day system shall afford the Superintendent reasonable opportunity to inspect all of the operator's activities, services, records, and facilities and to interview its agents and employees and any child within its control. Whenever a child day program or family day system subject to inspection under this section is determined by the Superintendent to be in noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter or with regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, the Superintendent shall give reasonable notice to the child day program or family day system of the nature of its noncompliance and may thereafter take appropriate action as provided by law, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the child day program or family day system.
