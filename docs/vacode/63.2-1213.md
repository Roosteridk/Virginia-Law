# § 63.2-1213 Final order of adoption.

After consideration of the report made pursuant to § [63.2-1212](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1212/) or as permitted pursuant to § [63.2-1210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1210/), if the circuit court is satisfied that the best interests of the child will be served thereby, the circuit court shall enter the final order of adoption. However, a final order of adoption shall not be entered until information has been furnished by the petitioner in compliance with § [32.1-262](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-262/) unless the circuit court, for good cause shown, finds the information to be unavailable or unnecessary. No circuit court shall deny a petitioner a final order of adoption for the sole reason that the child was placed in the physical custody of the petitioner by a person not authorized to make such placements pursuant to § [63.2-1200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1200/). An attested copy of every final order of adoption shall be forwarded, by the clerk of the circuit court in which it was entered, to the Commissioner and to the child-placing agency that placed the child or to the local director, in cases where the child was not placed by an agency.
