# § 63.2-906 Foster care plans; permissible plan goals; court review of foster children.

A. Each child who is committed or entrusted to the care of a local board or to a licensed child-placing agency or who is placed through an agreement between a local board and the parent, parents or guardians, where legal custody remains with the parent, parents or guardians, shall have a foster care plan prepared by the local department, the child welfare agency, or the family assessment and planning team established pursuant to § [2.2-5207](/vacode/2.2-5207/), as specified in § [16.1-281](/vacode/16.1-281/). The representatives of such local department, child welfare agency, or team shall (i) involve in the development of the plan the child's parent(s), except when parental rights have been terminated or the local department or child welfare agency has made diligent efforts to locate the parent(s) and such parent(s) cannot be located, relatives and fictive kin who are interested in the child's welfare, and any other person or persons standing in loco parentis at the time the board or child welfare agency obtained custody or the board or the child welfare agency placed the child and (ii) for any child for whom reunification remains the goal, meet and consult with the child's parent(s) or other person standing in loco parentis, provided that the parent(s) or other person has been located and parental rights have not been terminated, no less than once every two months and at all critical decision-making points throughout the child's foster care case. If reunification is not the goal for the child, the local board, child welfare agency, or team shall provide information to the child's parents regarding the parents' option to voluntarily terminate parental rights, unless a parent's parental rights have been terminated. The representatives of such department, child welfare agency, or team shall involve the child in the development of the plan if (a) the child is 12 years of age or older or (b) the child is younger than 12 years of age and such involvement is consistent with the best interests of the child. In cases where either the parent(s) or child is not involved in the development of the plan, the department, child welfare agency, or team shall include in the plan a full description of the reasons therefor in accordance with § [16.1-281](/vacode/16.1-281/).

A court may place a child in the care and custody of (1) a public agency in accordance with § [16.1-251](/vacode/16.1-251/) or [16.1-252](/vacode/16.1-252/) or (2) a public or licensed private child-placing agency in accordance with § [16.1-278.2](/vacode/16.1-278.2/), [16.1-278.4](/vacode/16.1-278.4/), [16.1-278.5](/vacode/16.1-278.5/), [16.1-278.6](/vacode/16.1-278.6/), or [16.1-278.8](/vacode/16.1-278.8/). Children may be placed by voluntary relinquishment in the care and custody of a public or private agency in accordance with § [16.1-277.01](/vacode/16.1-277.01/) or §§ [16.1-277.02](/vacode/16.1-277.02/) and [16.1-278.3](/vacode/16.1-278.3/). Children may be placed through an agreement where legal custody remains with the parent, parents or guardians in accordance with §§ [63.2-900](/vacode/63.2-900/) and [63.2-903](/vacode/63.2-903/), or § [2.2-5208](/vacode/2.2-5208/).

B. Each child in foster care shall be assigned a permanent plan goal to be reviewed and approved by the juvenile and domestic relations district court having jurisdiction of the child's case. Permissible plan goals are to:

1. Transfer custody of the child to his prior family;

2. Transfer custody of the child to a relative other than his prior family or to fictive kin for the purpose of establishing eligibility for the Federal-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program pursuant to § [63.2-1305](/vacode/63.2-1305/) or the State-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program pursuant to § [63.2-1306](/vacode/63.2-1306/);

3. Finalize an adoption of the child;

4. Place a child who is 16 years of age or older in permanent foster care;

5. Transition to independent living if, and only if, the child is admitted to the United States as a refugee or asylee; or

6. Place a child who is 16 years of age or older in another planned permanent living arrangement in accordance with subsection A2 of § [16.1-282.1](/vacode/16.1-282.1/).

C. Each child in foster care shall be subject to the permanency planning and review procedures established in §§ [16.1-281](/vacode/16.1-281/), [16.1-282](/vacode/16.1-282/), and [16.1-282.1](/vacode/16.1-282.1/).
