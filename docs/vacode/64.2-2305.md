# § 64.2-2305 Entry of order that presumption of death is applicable; effect.

A. If, after the hearing conducted pursuant to § [64.2-2304](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2304/) and any subsequent publication required pursuant to that section, the court determines that the presumption of death is applicable, the court shall enter an order determining that the presumed decedent is in fact dead. Upon entry of such order, the court shall proceed to admit any will to probate, issue letters of administration to the party entitled thereto, or order that the claim of the heirs at law, devisees, next of kin, legatees, beneficiaries, survivors, or other successors in interest of the presumed decedent be established. If the order is subsequently revoked pursuant to § [64.2-2307](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2307/), all acts done in pursuance of or in reliance on the order shall be as valid as if the presumed decedent were actually dead.

B. The court's order determining a person to be dead shall state the person's date of death to be:

1. The date of the expiration of the seven-year period in a proceeding governed by subsection A of § [64.2-2300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2300/), except that in a proceeding governed by subdivision A 1 c of § [64.2-2300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2300/) it shall be the date of the Department of State's issuance of a report of presumptive death unless the evidence shows the likelihood of death at an earlier date;

2. The date of the person's exposure to the specific peril of death in a proceeding governed by subsection B of § [64.2-2300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2300/); or

3. The date of the person's disappearance in a proceeding governed by subsection C of § [64.2-2300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2300/).

C. A certified copy of the court's order determining that the presumed decedent is in fact dead shall be accepted as proof of death in all situations in which a certificate of death issued by the State Registrar of Vital Records of the Virginia Department of Health would have been accepted as such proof.
