B. Any person who undertakes work without (i) any valid Virginia contractor's license or certificate when a license or certificate is required by this chapter or (ii) the proper class of license as defined in § [54.1-1100](/vacode/54.1-1100/) for the work undertaken, shall be fined an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each day that such person is in violation, in addition to the authorized penalties for the commission of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Any violation of clause (i) of this subsection shall also constitute a prohibited practice in accordance with § [59.1-200](/vacode/59.1-200/), provided that the violation involves a consumer transaction as defined in the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ [59.1-196](/vacode/59.1-196/) et seq.), and shall be subject to any and all of the enforcement provisions of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act.

C.

Failure to renew a license or certificate issued in accordance with this chapter shall create a rebuttable presumption of actual knowledge of such licensing or certification requirements.
