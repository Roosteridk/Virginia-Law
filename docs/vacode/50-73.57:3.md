1. If the surviving or resulting entity is not continuing to transact business in the Commonwealth or is not a foreign corporation, limited liability company, business trust, or partnership registered as a registered limited liability partnership, then, within 30 days after such entity conversion, it shall comply on behalf of the predecessor limited partnership with the provisions of ยง [50-73.58](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.58/); or

Upon the entity conversion of a foreign limited partnership that is registered to transact business in the Commonwealth, all property in the Commonwealth owned by the foreign limited partnership shall pass to the surviving or resulting entity except as otherwise provided by the laws of the state or other jurisdiction by which it is governed, but only from and after the time when a duly authenticated copy of the instrument of entity conversion is filed with the Commission.
