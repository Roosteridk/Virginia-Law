# ยง 29.1-347 Renewing licenses.

The holders of licenses first issued under this article may renew the same privileges each succeeding year by licensing within the time required and placing the license tag on the stake or blind as required by this article. The exclusive privileges prescribed with respect to owners and their lessees and permittees in ยง [29.1-344](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/29.1-344/) shall be recurrent each year even if the privileges were forfeited to some other person or persons in the preceding year. If any blind is destroyed in any manner beyond the control of the owner, it may be replaced within thirty days without losing the position which it formerly occupied. Those licensing stationary blinds in the public waters shall remove the blinds when the licenses expire or when they no longer intend to use them, whichever occurs first.
