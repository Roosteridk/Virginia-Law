# § 5.1-36 Agreement for joint exercise of powers; governing board, etc., to act on behalf of political subdivisions; powers of board, etc.

The agreement provided for in § [5.1-35](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/5.1-35/) may provide for the creation of a governing board, commission, authority or body empowered to have and exercise, on behalf of the several political subdivisions which are parties to such agreement, the powers, rights and authority conferred on such political subdivisions by this article. Members of the governing bodies of the several political subdivisions may serve as a member of a board, commission, authority or body formed pursuant to § [5.1-35](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/5.1-35/). Such agreement shall specify the name of the board, commission, authority or body and its composition and prescribe its powers and duties which may include powers to establish, construct, manage, and operate an airport, acquire, hold and dispose of property but on behalf of the several political subdivisions, including the exercise on their behalf of the power of eminent domain. If any such board, commission, authority or body is created, all proceedings in connection with the establishment, construction, management and operation of the airport, including application for and issuance of any license required therefor, shall be in its name. The intent of § [5.1-35](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/5.1-35/) and this section is that any such board, commission, authority or body established by two or more political subdivisions or through action of the General Assembly may have the same powers granted to a city, town and county but in no case will such powers be greater than those granted to a city, town or county. Any joint airport authority created pursuant to this chapter and in existence on July 1, 1994, shall be continued in lawful existence under the terms and provisions of this chapter even though all the political subdivisions except one withdraw from the joint airport authority.
