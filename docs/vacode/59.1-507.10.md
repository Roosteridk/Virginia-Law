# ยง 59.1-507.10 Retraction of anticipatory repudiation.

(b) A retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform the contract. However, a retraction must contain any assurance justifiably demanded under ยง [59.1-507.8](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-507.8/).
