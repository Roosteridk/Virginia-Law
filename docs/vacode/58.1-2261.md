# § 58.1-2261 Refund procedure; investigations.

A. Any person entitled to a refund pursuant to § [58.1-2259](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2259/) shall file with the Commissioner an application on a form prepared and furnished by the Commissioner. Such application shall contain the information and certifications required by the Commissioner. The applicant shall set forth the basis for the claimed refund, the total amount of such fuel purchased and used by such applicant, and how such fuel was used. The applicant shall retain the paid ticket, invoice, or other document from the seller documenting the purchase of the fuel on which a refund is claimed for a period of time to be determined by the Commissioner. The Commissioner, upon the presentation of such application shall refund to the claimant the proper amount of the tax paid as provided in this chapter, subject to the provisions of subsection D. A ticket issued to the holder of a credit card as evidence of the delivery to such holder of tax-paid fuel shall, for the purpose of this section, be a paid ticket or invoice. Tickets or invoices marked "duplicate" shall not be acceptable.

B. The application for a refund shall be filed within one year from the date of the sale as shown on the paid ticket or invoice. For those that pay the motor fuels tax in accordance with § [58.1-2200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2200/), if the refund amount certified by the Commissioner is different from the amount requested by the applicant, the Commissioner shall provide an explanation to the applicant of why the refund amount differs from the amount requested.

C. In the event an assessment is rendered for failure to report and pay the tax imposed as provided in § [58.1-2217](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2217/) or § [58.1-2249](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2249/) and such fuel is subject to refund under the provisions of § [58.1-2259](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2259/), the application for a refund shall be filed with the Commissioner by the person entitled to such refund within one year from the date such assessment is paid and shall be accompanied by invoices covering the sale of the fuel and billing of tax to such person.

D. The Department may make any investigation it considers necessary before refunding the fuels tax to a person, and may investigate a refund after the refund has been issued and within the time frame for adjusting tax under this chapter. As a part of such investigation, the Department may require that the person provide the paid ticket, invoice, or other document from the seller documenting the purchase of the fuel on which a refund is claimed. Failure to provide a ticket, invoice, or other document evidencing the purchase of such fuel on which a refund is requested or was previously granted will result in the denial or reversal of that refund.

E. In accordance with § [58.1-609.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-609.1/), any person who is refunded tax pursuant to § [58.1-2259](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2259/) shall be subject to the taxes imposed by Chapter 6 (§ [58.1-600](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-600/) et seq.) of this title, unless such transaction is specifically exempted pursuant to § [58.1-609.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-609.1/).
