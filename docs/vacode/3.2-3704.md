Each permit to do business as a contractor shall expire on June 30 of the permitting year for which the Commissioner issued the permit. Every such permit shall be valid through July 31 of the next permitting year or until issuance of the renewal permit, whichever occurs first, if the holder of the permit has filed a renewal application with the Commissioner on or before June 30 of the permitting year for which the Commissioner issued the permit.

B. The Commissioner shall grant to a contractor who has failed to obtain a contractor's permit to do business during the permitting year a grace period of 15 working days, starting upon issuance of notification, to obtain the permit without the payment of a late fee. If the contractor fails to obtain a permit by the 15th day of the grace period, the contractor shall pay to the Commissioner a $50 late fee in addition to the permit fee, and the Commissioner shall cause a stop sale, use, removal or seizure order to be issued on any liming material the contractor sells until the contractor obtains the required permit.

C. The contractor shall guarantee the consumer that the contractor shall comply with all provisions of this chapter that apply to the sale and delivery of bulk liming material.
