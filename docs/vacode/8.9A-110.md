# § 8.9A-110 Security interests arising under Title 8.2 or Title 8.2A.

A security interest arising under §§ [8.2-401](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2-401/), [8.2-505](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2-505/), [8.2-711](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2-711/) (3), or § [8.2A-508](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-508/) (5) is subject to this title. However, until the debtor obtains possession of the goods:

(1) the security interest is enforceable, even if subdivision (b) (3) of § [8.9A-203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-203/) has not been satisfied;

(2) filing is not required to perfect the security interest;

(3) the rights of the secured party after default by the debtor are governed by Title 8.2 or Title 8.2A; and

(4) the security interest has priority over a conflicting security interest created by the debtor.
