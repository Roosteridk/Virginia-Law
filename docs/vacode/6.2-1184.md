# ยง 6.2-1184 Dealing with successors in interest.

In the case of any investment made by a savings institution in a real estate loan, if (i) the ownership of the real estate security or any part thereof becomes vested in a person other than the party originally executing the security instruments and (ii) there is not an agreement in writing to the contrary, a savings institution may, without notice to such party, deal with such successor in interest with reference to that mortgage and the debt thereby secured in the same manner as with such party. The savings institution may forbear to sue or may extend time for payment, or otherwise modify the terms, of the debt secured thereby without discharging or in any way affecting the original liability of such party or parties thereunder or upon the debt thereby secured.
