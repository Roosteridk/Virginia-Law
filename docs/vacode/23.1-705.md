C. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, in order to ensure that the Plan is able to meet its current obligations, the Governor shall include in the budget bills submitted pursuant to ยง [2.2-1509](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1509/) a sum sufficient appropriation for the purpose of ensuring that the Plan can meet the current obligations of the Plan.
