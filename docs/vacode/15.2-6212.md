Appropriate attested copies of such resolutions shall be delivered to the Governor so that legislation dissolving the Authority may be introduced in the General Assembly.

The title to all funds and other property owned by the Authority at the time of such dissolution shall vest in the counties and cities which have contributed to the fund in proportion to their respective contributions.
