# § 63.2-1237 Petition for parental placement adoption; jurisdiction; contents.

Proceedings for the parental placement adoption of a minor child and for a change of name of such child shall be instituted only by petition to the circuit court in the county or city in which the petitioner resides or in the county or city where a birth parent has executed a consent pursuant to § [63.2-1233](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1233/). Such petition may be filed by any natural person who resides in the Commonwealth or is the adopting parent(s) of a child who was subject to a consent proceeding held pursuant to § [63.2-1233](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1233/). The petition shall ask leave to adopt a minor child not legally the petitioner's by birth and, if it is so desired by the petitioner, also to change the name of such child. In the case of married persons, the petition shall be the joint petition of the husband and wife but, in the event the child to be adopted is legally the child by birth or adoption of one of the petitioners, such petitioner shall unite in the petition for the purpose of indicating his or her consent to the prayer thereof only. The petition shall contain a full disclosure of the circumstances under which the child came to live, and is living, in the home of the petitioner. Each petition for adoption shall be signed by the petitioner as well as by counsel of record, if any. In any case in which the petition seeks the entry of an adoption order without referral for investigation, the petition shall be under oath.

The petition shall state that the findings required by § [63.2-1232](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1232/) have been made and shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation supporting such statement, to include copies of documents executing consent and transferring custody of the child to the prospective adoptive parents, and a copy of the report required by § [63.2-1231](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1231/). The court shall not waive any of the requirements of this paragraph nor any of the requirements of § [63.2-1232](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1232/) except as allowed pursuant to subsection D of § [63.2-1232](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1232/) or subdivision 4 of § [63.2-1233](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1233/).

A single petition for adoption under the provisions of this section shall be sufficient for the concurrent adoption by the same petitioners of two or more children who have the same birth parent or parents; and nothing in this section shall be construed as having heretofore required a separate petition for each of such children.
