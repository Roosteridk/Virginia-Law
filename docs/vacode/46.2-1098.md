# § 46.2-1098 Penalties; violations not negligence per se.

Any person, including those subject to jurisdiction of a juvenile and domestic relations district court, found guilty of violating this article shall be subject to a civil penalty of $50, which shall not be suspended in whole or in part, for a violation of § [46.2-1095](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1095/); however, any person found guilty of violating § [46.2-1095](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1095/) a second or subsequent time when the violations occurred on different dates shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500. An additional civil penalty of $20 shall be imposed for failure to carry a statement as required by § [46.2-1096](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1096/). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of § [46.2-1095](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1095/), the court may waive or suspend the imposition of the penalty for a violation of § [46.2-1095](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1095/) if it finds that the failure of the defendant to comply with the section was due to his financial inability to acquire a child restraint system. All civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid into the Child Restraint Device Special Fund as provided for in § [46.2-1097](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1097/).

No assignment of demerit points shall be made under Article 19 (§ [46.2-489](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-489/) et seq.) of Chapter 3 of this title and no court costs shall be assessed for violation of § [46.2-1095](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1095/).

Violations of this article shall not constitute negligence per se; nor shall violation of this article constitute a defense to any claim for personal injuries to a child or recovery of medical expenses for injuries sustained in any motor vehicle accident.
