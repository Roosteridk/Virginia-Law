Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon any settlement or final determination resulting in a judgment for the owner, whether funds have been paid into the court or are outstanding, all such funds due and owing shall be payable to the owner or, if the owner consents, to the owner's attorney within 30 days of the settlement or final determination, unless otherwise subject to ยง [25.1-240](/vacode/25.1-240/), [25.1-241](/vacode/25.1-241/), [25.1-243](/vacode/25.1-243/), or [25.1-250](/vacode/25.1-250/).

The provisions of this section and its remedies shall apply to any condemnation action whether such action arises under this title or under Title 33.2.
