# ยง 22.1-279.3:3 Alternative school discipline process for certain incidents.

A. A school board may establish an alternative school discipline process to provide the parties involved in an incident of assault or assault and battery, without bodily injury, of any person on a school bus, on school property, or at a school-sponsored activity the option to enter into a mutually agreed-upon process between the involved parties. Such process shall be designed to hold the student accountable for a noncriminal offense through a mutually agreed-upon standard.

B. If provided for in the process established by the school board, no principal shall report to the local law-enforcement agency a party who successfully completes the alternative school discipline process. If the parties fail to agree to participate in the process or fail to successfully complete the alternative school discipline process, then the principal may report the incident to the local law-enforcement agency.
