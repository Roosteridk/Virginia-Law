# ยง 64.2-2301 Distribution of fund when presumption of death not applicable.

A. In any civil action wherein any estate or fund is to be distributed, if the interest of any person to the estate or fund depends upon his having been alive at a particular time and it is not known and cannot be shown by the exercise of reasonable diligence whether such person was alive at that time, and if the legal presumption of death does not apply, the court may enter an order distributing the estate or fund to those who would be otherwise entitled thereto if it were shown that such person was dead at such particular time.

B. Before any distribution is made pursuant to subsection A, the court shall require that, until the person is determined to be dead in accordance with ยง [64.2-2300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2300/), the heir at law, devisee, next of kin, legatee, beneficiary, survivor, or other successor in interest shall give a refunding bond with surety in such form as the court directs upon condition to account for the estate or fund to any person who may establish title thereto adverse to that of such heir at law, devisee, next of kin, legatee, beneficiary, survivor, or other successor in interest.

C. No motion shall be made hereunder except after reasonable notice to all parties upon whom service may be had. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect in any way any requirement of law as to service of process.
