# ยง 8.01-46.2 Civil action for dissemination of intimate images to another; penalty.

A. As used in this section:

"Electronic communication device" means the same as that term is defined in ยง [18.2-190.1](/vacode/18.2-190.1/).

"Intimate image" means a photograph, film, video, recording, digital picture, or other visual reproduction of a person 18 years of age or older who is in a state of undress so as to expose the human male or female genitals.

The court may also enjoin and restrain the defendant from committing such further acts.

The remedies provided by this section are cumulative and shall not be construed as restricting a remedy that is available under any other law.
