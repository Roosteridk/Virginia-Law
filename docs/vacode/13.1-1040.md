# § 13.1-1040 Right of assignee to become member.

A. Except as otherwise provided in writing in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, an assignee of an interest in a limited liability company may become a member only by the consent of a majority of the member-managers (other than the assignor member) of a manager-managed limited liability company of which one or more members is a manager, or by a majority vote of the members (other than the assignor member) of any other limited liability company.

B. An assignee who has become a member has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the articles of organization, any operating agreement and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a member also is liable for any obligations of his assignor to make contributions and return distributions as provided in Articles 5 (§ [13.1-1022](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1022/) et seq.) and 6 (§ [13.1-1029](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1029/) et seq.) of this chapter. However, an assignee who becomes a member is not obligated for liabilities of the assignor unknown to him at the time he or it became a member.

C. If an assignee of an interest in a limited liability company becomes a member, the assignor is not released from his liability under §§ [13.1-1027](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1027/) and [13.1-1036](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1036/) to the limited liability company.
