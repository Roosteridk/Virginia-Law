# § 33.2-120  Efforts to increase CAFE standards.

A. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning, "CAFE standards" means the corporate average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks manufactured for sale in the United States that have been implemented pursuant to the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-163), as amended.

B. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to support federal action that provides for:

1. An increase in the CAFE standards from the current standard by promoting performance-based tax credits for advanced technology, fuel-efficient vehicles to facilitate the introduction and purchase of such vehicles; and

2. Market incentives and education programs to build demand for high-efficiency, cleaner vehicles, including tax incentives for highly efficient vehicles.
