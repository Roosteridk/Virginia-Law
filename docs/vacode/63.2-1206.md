If, after the expiration of the appropriate revocation period provided for in § [63.2-1223](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1223/) or § [63.2-1234](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1234/), a birth parent or an alleged birth parent attempts to obtain or regain custody of or attempts to exercise parental rights to a child who has been placed for adoption, there shall be no parental presumption in favor of any party.
