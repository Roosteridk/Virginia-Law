# ยง 8.01-633 Damages on dissolution.

When an injunction to stay proceedings on a judgment or decree for money is dissolved wholly or in part there shall be paid to the party having such judgment or decree damages at the rate of ten per centum per annum from the time the injunction took effect until the dissolution, on such sum as appears to be due, including the costs; but the court wherein the injunction is may direct that no such damages be paid, or that there be paid only such portion thereof as it may deem just. In a case wherein a forthcoming bond was forfeited, and no execution was had thereon before the injunction took effect, a court awarding such execution shall include in its judgment or decree damages as aforesaid. In other cases damages may be included in the execution on the judgment or decree to which the injunction was awarded.
