A. No person shall drive, cause to be driven, or permit the driving of a "for hire" motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth unless the legal name or trade name of the motor carrier as defined in Chapter 20 (§ [46.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-2000/) et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ [46.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-2100/) et seq.) operating the vehicle is plainly displayed on both sides of the vehicle. The letters and numerals in the display shall be of such size, shape, and color as to be readily legible during daylight hours from a distance of 50 feet while the vehicle is not in motion. The display shall be kept legible and may take the form of a removable device which meets the identification and legibility requirements of this section.
