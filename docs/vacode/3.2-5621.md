# § 3.2-5621 Rejected weights and measures.

Weights and measures that have been rejected or condemned for repair under the authority of the Commissioner, of an inspector, or of a sealer shall remain subject to the control of the rejecting authority until such time as suitable repair or disposition thereof has been made as required by this section. The owners of such rejected weights and measures shall cause the same to be made in compliance with this chapter within such time as may be authorized by the rejecting authority, or, in lieu of this, may dispose of the same, but only in such a manner as is specifically authorized by the rejecting authority. Weights and measures that have been rejected shall not again be used commercially until they have been officially reexamined by the rejecting authority, and found to be in compliance with this chapter, or until specific written permission for such use is issued by the rejecting authority.
