# ยง 54.1-3905 Furnishing advice and services for compensation in connection with certain debt-pooling plans deemed practicing law.

The furnishing of advice or services for compensation to a debtor in connection with a debt-pooling plan pursuant to which the debtor deposits funds for the purpose of distributing them among his creditors, except as authorized for persons licensed pursuant to ยง [6.2-2005](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-2005/), shall be deemed to be practicing law. Any person or agency not so authorized or who is not a member of the Virginia State Bar who furnishes or offers to furnish such advice or services for compensation shall be in violation of this section. However, it shall not constitute the practice of law merely to make or undertake to make payments to creditors on behalf of debtors, provided any person or agency that does so does not also negotiate with creditors, undertake to negotiate with creditors, or hold itself out as undertaking to negotiate with creditors on behalf of one or more debtors. Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
