# § 54.1-2352 Cease and desist orders.

A. The Board may issue an order requiring the governing board of the association to cease and desist from the unlawful practice and to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the Board will carry out the purposes of this article, if the Board determines after notice and hearing that the governing board of an association has:

1. Violated any statute or regulation of the Board governing the association regulated pursuant to this article, including engaging in any act or practice in violation of this article, the Property Owners' Association Act (§ [55.1-1800](/vacode/55.1-1800/) et seq.), the Virginia Condominium Act (§ [55.1-1900](/vacode/55.1-1900/) et seq.), the Virginia Real Estate Cooperative Act (§ [55.1-2100](/vacode/55.1-2100/) et seq.), or the Virginia Real Estate Time-Share Act (§ [55.1-2200](/vacode/55.1-2200/) et seq.), or any of the Board's regulations or orders;

2. Failed to register as an association or to file an annual report as required by statute or regulation;

3. Materially misrepresented facts in an application for registration or an annual report; or

4. Willfully refused to furnish the Board information or records required or requested pursuant to statute or regulation.

B. If the Board makes a finding of fact in writing that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, it may issue a temporary order to cease and desist or to take such affirmative action as may be deemed appropriate by the Board. Prior to issuing the temporary order, the Board shall give notice of the proposal to issue a temporary order to the person. Every temporary order shall include in its terms a provision that upon request a hearing will be held promptly to determine whether or not it becomes permanent.
