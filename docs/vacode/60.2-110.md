# § 60.2-110 State Job Service and Unemployment Insurance Services Division.

The Commission may establish two coordinate divisions: the Virginia State Job Service, created pursuant to § [60.2-400](/vacode/60.2-400/), and the Unemployment Insurance Services Division. Each division shall be responsible for the discharge of its distinctive functions. Each division shall be a separate administrative unit, with respect to personnel, budget, and duties, except insofar as the Commission may find that such separation is impracticable. In lieu, however, of establishing the two divisions the Commission may cooperate with and utilize the personnel and services of employment offices or services operated by the United States or any of its authorized agencies but only to the extent necessary for the federal employment offices or services to perform the functions imposed upon employment offices by § [60.2-601](/vacode/60.2-601/) and subdivision A 5 of § [60.2-612](/vacode/60.2-612/).

Code 1950, § 60-28; 1968, c. 738, § 60.1-33; 1986, c. 480; 2022, c. [668](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0668).
