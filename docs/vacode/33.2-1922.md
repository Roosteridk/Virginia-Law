# § 33.2-1922 Contracts and payment thereof.

A. Any county or city embraced by a transportation district is authorized to enter into contracts or agreements with the commission for such transportation district, or with an agency, pursuant to which such transportation district, subject to the limitations contained in this section, or such agency undertakes to provide the transportation facilities specified in a duly adopted transportation plan or to render transportation service. Any obligations arising from such contracts are deemed to be for a public purpose and may be paid for, in the discretion of each county or city, in whole or in part, by appropriations from general revenues or from the proceeds of a bond issue or issues; however, any such contract must specify the annual maximum obligation of any county or city for payments to meet the expenses and obligations of the transportation district or such agency or provide a formula to determine the payment of any such county or city for such expenses and obligations. Each county or city desiring to contract with a transportation district or an agency is authorized to do so, provided it complies with the appropriate provisions of law, and thereafter is authorized to do everything necessary or proper to carry out and perform every such contract and to provide for the payment or discharge of any obligation thereunder by the same means and in the same manner as any other of its obligations.

B. Except as otherwise provided by law:

1. No bonded debt shall be contracted by any county to finance the payment of any obligations arising from its contracts hereunder unless the voters of such county shall approve by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election the contracting of any such debt, the borrowing of money, and issuance of bonds. Such debt shall be contracted and bonds issued and such election shall be held in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of the Public Finance Act (§ [15.2-2600](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2600/) et seq.) relating to counties; and

2. The contracting of debt, borrowing of money, and issuance of bonds by any city to finance the payment of any obligations arising from its contracts hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of the Public Finance Act (§ [15.2-2600](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2600/) et seq.) relating to cities.
