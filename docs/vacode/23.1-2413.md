A. All capital projects of the Authority shall be approved by the board. Within 30 days after approval of any capital project in excess of $5 million, the board shall notify the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees of the scope, cost, and construction schedule of the proposed capital project. The board may undertake the project unless either Committee raises objections within 30 days of the notification, in which case the Authority shall not undertake the project until such objections are resolved.

B. Before the Authority materially increases the size or materially changes the scope of any capital project for which construction has commenced, such project shall be approved again by the board in accordance with subsection A and, in the case of any capital project in excess of $5 million, presented again to the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees in accordance with subsection A.

C. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Authority is not subject to any further process or procedure that requires the submission, review, or approval of any capital project; however, the Authority shall ensure that Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) Code or any successor code and fire safety inspections are conducted for any capital project and that such projects are inspected by the State Fire Marshal or his designee prior to certification for building occupancy.
