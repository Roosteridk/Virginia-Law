# ยง 38.2-1900 Purposes of chapter.

A. This chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve the purposes stated in subsection B of this section.

B. The purposes of this chapter are to:

1. Protect policyholders and the public against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates;

2. Encourage independent action by insurers and reasonable price competition among insurers as the most effective way to produce rates that conform to the standards of subdivision 1;

3. Provide formal regulatory controls for use if independent action and price competition fail;

4. Authorize cooperative action among insurers in the rate making process, and regulate such cooperation in order to prevent practices that tend to create monopoly or to lessen or destroy competition;

5. Provide rates that are responsive to competitive market conditions and improve the availability of insurance in this Commonwealth; and

6. Regulate the business of insurance in a manner that will preclude application of federal antitrust laws.
