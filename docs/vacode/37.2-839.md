# § 37.2-839 Exchange of information between community services boards or behavioral health authorities and state facilities.

Community services boards or behavioral health authorities and state facilities may, when the individual has refused authorization, exchange the information required to prepare and implement a comprehensive individualized treatment plan, including a discharge plan as specified in subsection A of § [37.2-837](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-837/). This section shall apply to all individuals receiving services from community services boards, behavioral health authorities, and state facilities.

When an individual who is deemed suitable for discharge pursuant to subsection A of § [37.2-837](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-837/) or his guardian or conservator refuses to authorize the release of information that is required to formulate and implement a discharge plan as specified in subsection A of § [37.2-837](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-837/), then the community services board or behavioral health authority may release without authorization to those service providers and human service agencies identified in the discharge plan only the information needed to secure those services specified in the plan.

The release of any other information about an individual receiving services to any agency or person not affiliated directly or by contract with community services boards, behavioral health authorities, or state facilities shall be subject to all regulations adopted by the Board or by agencies of the United States government that govern confidentiality of patient information.
