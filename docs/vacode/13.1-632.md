A. A foreign corporation may register its corporate name, or its corporate name with any addition required by § [13.1-762](/vacode/13.1-762/), if the name is distinguishable upon the records of the Commission.

B. A foreign corporation registers its corporate name, or its corporate name with any addition required by § [13.1-762](/vacode/13.1-762/), by filing with the Commission (i) an application setting forth its corporate name, or its corporate name with any addition required by § [13.1-762](/vacode/13.1-762/), the state or country and date of its incorporation, and a brief description of the nature of the business in which it is engaged; and (ii) a certificate setting forth that such corporation is in good standing, or a document of similar import, from the state or country of incorporation, executed by the official who has custody of the records pertaining to corporations.

C. Except as provided in subsection F, registration is effective for one year after the date an application is filed.
