# § 58.1-3713.4 Additional one percent tax on gas.

Notwithstanding the rate limitations established in §§ [58.1-3712](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3712/) and [58.1-3713](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3713/), a county or city may levy an additional license tax on every person engaging in the business of severing gases from the earth. The license tax shall be at a rate not to exceed one percent of the gross receipts from the sale of gases severed within the county or city. The provisions of § [58.1-3712](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3712/) as they relate to measurement of gross receipts shall be applicable to this section. The revenue received from such additional tax shall be paid into the general fund of the county or city from where the gases are severed. However, in the Counties of Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, Russell, Scott, Tazewell, and Wise and the City of Norton one-half of the revenues derived from such tax shall be paid to the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Fund.
