# § 20-146.31 Hearing and order.

A. Unless the court issues a temporary emergency order pursuant to § [20-146.15](/vacode/20-146.15/), upon a finding that a petitioner is entitled to immediate physical custody of the child, the court shall order that the petitioner may take immediate physical custody of the child unless the respondent establishes that:

1. The child custody determination has not been registered under § [20-146.26](/vacode/20-146.26/) and that:

a. The issuing court did not have jurisdiction under Article 2 (§ [20-146.12](/vacode/20-146.12/) et seq.);

b. The child custody determination for which enforcement is sought has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under Article 2 (§ [20-146.12](/vacode/20-146.12/) et seq.); or

c. The respondent was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in accordance with the standards of § [20-146.7](/vacode/20-146.7/), in the proceedings before the court that issued the order for which enforcement is sought; or

2. The child custody determination for which enforcement is sought was registered under § [20-146.26](/vacode/20-146.26/), but has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under Article 2 (§ [20-146.12](/vacode/20-146.12/) et seq.).

B. The court shall award the fees, costs, and expenses authorized under § [20-146.33](/vacode/20-146.33/) and may grant additional relief, including a request for the assistance of law-enforcement officials, and set a further hearing to determine whether additional relief is appropriate.

C. If a party called to testify refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony may be self-incriminating, the court may draw an adverse inference from the refusal.

D. A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses and a defense of immunity based on the relationship between spouses or between parent and child may not be invoked in a proceeding under this article.
