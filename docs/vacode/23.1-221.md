# § 23.1-221 Refusal, suspension, and revocation of approval or certification.

A. The Council may refuse to grant a certification, may revoke or suspend a prior approval or certification, including any approval or authorization issued prior to July 1, 1980, and may add conditions to any approval or certification on such grounds as may be provided in its regulations or if the postsecondary school:

1. Submits or has submitted any false or misleading information to the Council in connection with its approval;

2. Fails to meet or to maintain compliance with the Council's regulations at any of its locations;

3. Publicly makes or causes to be made any false or misleading representation that it has complied with any requirement of this article or the Council's regulations;

4. Violates any provision of this article or the Council's regulations; or

5. Fails or refuses to furnish the Council with any requested information or records required by this article or the Council's regulations.

B. The Council may refuse to grant an approval or may place conditions on an approval for a request to use a name that incorporates terms deemed by the Council to be misleading to consumers, students, or the general public regarding the postsecondary school's affiliation or association with any public institution of higher education but shall not add conditions to, revoke, or suspend a prior approval of a name. The Council shall, by regulation, designate the terms deemed to be misleading, which shall include "public university," "public college," and "community college."

C. The Council shall notify a postsecondary school by certified mail, return receipt requested, of its intention to deny an application, suspend or revoke a prior approval or certification, or add conditions to an approval or certification and state in writing the reasons for the denial, suspension, revocation, or conditions. The postsecondary school may, within 10 days of receipt of the certified mail notice, submit a written request for a proceeding before the Council pursuant to Article 3 (§ [2.2-4018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4018/) et seq.) of Chapter 40 of Title 2.2.

D. The Council may issue orders to comply with its regulations or the provisions of this article; unless an emergency exists, such orders shall only be issued after a proceeding pursuant to Article 3 (§ [2.2-4018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4018/) et seq.) of Chapter 40 of Title 2.2.

E. In accordance with Article 3 (§ [2.2-4018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4018/) et seq.) of Chapter 40 of Title 2.2, any postsecondary school aggrieved by (i) a decision of the Council to deny an application, suspend or revoke a prior approval or certification, or add conditions to an approval or certification or (ii) any order to comply with this article or the Council's regulations may appeal such decision. The Council shall make a final administrative decision on such appeal in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.).

F. In order to regain approval, a postsecondary school that has had its approval or certification revoked or suspended by the Council shall file a new application for certification and provide clear and convincing evidence that the conditions resulting in the suspension or revocation have been remedied and the postsecondary school is in compliance with this article and the Council's regulations.
