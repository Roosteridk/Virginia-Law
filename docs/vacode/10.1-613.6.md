# § 10.1-613.6 Negotiated settlement agreements.

With the consent of any owner of an impounding structure who has allegedly violated or failed, neglected, or refused to obey any regulation or order of the Board, any condition of a permit, or any provision of this chapter, the Board may enter into a negotiated settlement agreement with such owner, so long as the impounding structure or dam is not subject to the provisions of § [10.1-609](/vacode/10.1-609/), to correct deficiencies at the structure according to the schedule of implementation appended to the negotiated settlement agreement and for the payment of civil charges for past alleged violations in specific sums not to exceed the limit specified in § [10.1-613.2](/vacode/10.1-613.2/). Such civil charges shall be suspended upon compliance with the terms and conditions of the negotiated settlement agreement as determined by the Director. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty that could be imposed under § [10.1-613.2](/vacode/10.1-613.2/) and shall be paid into the Dam Safety, Flood Prevention and Protection Assistance Fund established by Article 1.2 (§ [10.1-603.16](/vacode/10.1-603.16/) et seq.).
