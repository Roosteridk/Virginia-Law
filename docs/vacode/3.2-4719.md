# ยง 3.2-4719 Duties and powers of Commissioner with respect to bonds.

The Commissioner may accept the proceeds from any bond and deposit the proceeds in the state treasury at interest in favor of the bond claimants. The Commissioner may institute and prosecute suits or actions in the name of the Commonwealth on behalf of claimants approved by him in any appropriate court for any purpose in connection with the collection or distribution of the bond or its proceeds. It shall be the duty of any person having a claim against a commission merchant to notify the Commissioner of his claim. The Commissioner shall have no duty to prosecute any claim unless he has received such notice and believes the claim is valid. If the Commissioner believes the claim to be invalid, he shall notify the claimant. The claimant shall then have his remedy pursuant to ยง [3.2-4718](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4718/). The Commissioner may appeal a decision of any court that is contrary to any distribution recommended or authorized by him.
