Further, the report shall specify the number of cases for each profession regulated by a health regulatory board by category of violation, including, but not limited to, standard of care violations, in which (i) a sanction was imposed; (ii) a confidential consent agreement was accepted; and (iii) more than two confidential consent agreements involving a standard of care violation were accepted by the relevant board for the same practitioner in a 10-year period. The information shall be reported only in the aggregate without reference to any individual's name or identifying particulars. In those portions of this report relating to the Board of Medicine, the Director shall include a summary of the data required by ยง [54.1-2910.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2910.1/).
