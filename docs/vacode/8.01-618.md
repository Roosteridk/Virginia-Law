# ยง 8.01-618 Reports of such settlements; when new bond required.

The court shall examine the reports required by ยง [8.01-617](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-617/), when the same are made to it; and, if satisfied of the correctness thereof, shall order them to be recorded. If it appears from the report of the commissioner that any bond of a receiver, or any bond or other security given by any person to whom money has been loaned under its order, is insufficient, the court shall order additional security to be given, or a new bond to be executed before it, in such penalty as may seem right, and with sufficient sureties. But the execution of such new bond shall not discharge the sureties in any prior bond for their liability for acts of the principal obligor done previous to the execution of such new bond.
