# § 19.2-386.11 Judgment of condemnation; destruction.

A. If the forfeiture is established, the judgment shall be that the property be condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth subject to any remission granted under subsection A of § [19.2-386.10](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.10/) and further that the same be sold, unless (i) a sale thereof has been already made under § [19.2-386.7](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.7/), (ii) the court determines that the property forfeited is of such minimal value that the sale would not be in the best interest of the Commonwealth or (iii) the court finds that the property may be subject to return to a participating agency. If the court finds that the property may be subject to return to an agency participating in the seizure in accordance with subsection C of § [19.2-386.14](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.14/), the order shall provide for storage of the property until the determination to return it is made or, if return is not made, for sale of the property as provided in this section and § [19.2-386.12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.12/). If sale has been made, the judgment shall be against the proceeds of sale, subject to the rights of any lien holder whose interest is not forfeited. If the property condemned has been delivered to the claimant under § [19.2-386.6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.6/), further judgment shall be against the obligors in the bond for the penalty thereof, to be discharged by the payment of the appraised value of the property, upon which judgment, process of execution shall be awarded and the clerk shall endorse thereon, "No security is to be taken."

B. Forfeited cash and negotiable instruments shall be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of § [19.2-386.12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.12/).
