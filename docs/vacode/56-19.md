# § 56-19 Contest by company whose works are crossed.

Any company whose works are to be crossed under the provisions of §§ [56-17](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-17/) and [56-18](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-18/) may, within fifteen days from the date of the submission of the plans and specifications mentioned in § [56-18](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-18/), apply to the State Corporation Commission to inquire into the necessity for such crossing, and the propriety of the proposed location, and all matters pertaining to its construction and operation; and thereupon, within thirty days from the date of such submission of plans and specifications, the Commission in its discretion may, by notice served upon both companies, suspend work on such crossing for such reasonable time, prescribed in the notice, as it may deem necessary to make such inquiry. The Commission may, in its discretion, where railroads or canals are to be crossed by other railroads or canals, employ expert engineers, at a cost not exceeding $500, to be paid equally by both companies, who shall, with the Commission, or some member thereof, or such person as the Commission may designate, (1) examine the location, plans, specifications and descriptions of appliances, and methods proposed to be employed, (2) hear any objections and consider any modifications that the company whose line is to be crossed desires to offer, and (3) within such time as the Commission may fix, reject, approve, or modify such plans and specifications. The final order of the Commission shall, unless an appeal be taken to the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of the same, be final and binding on both companies.
