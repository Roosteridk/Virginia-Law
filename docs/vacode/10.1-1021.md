(1) The ecological, outdoor recreational, historic, agricultural, and forestal value of the property;

(2) An assessment of market values;

(3) Consistency with local comprehensive plans;

(4) Geographical balance of properties and interests in properties to be purchased;

(5) Availability of public and private matching funds to assist in the purchase;

(6) Imminent danger of loss of natural, outdoor, recreational, or historic attributes of a significant portion of the land;

(7) Economic value to the locality and region attributable to the purchase;

(8) Advisory opinions from local governments, state agencies, or others;

(9) Whether the property has been identified by ConserveVirginia and whether the proposal seeks to preserve the conservation values identified by ConserveVirginia; and

(10) Whether the property is in an area lacking outdoor recreation facilities;

b. Develop an inventory of those properties in which the Commonwealth holds a legal interest for the purpose set forth in subsection A of § [10.1-1020](/vacode/10.1-1020/);
