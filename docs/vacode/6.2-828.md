# § 6.2-828 Conversion of state bank to federal savings institution.

A. A state bank may convert into a federal savings institution as follows:

1. At any meeting of the stockholders called and held in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-601](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-601/) et seq.) or the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-801](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-801/) et seq.) to consider such action, the stockholders, by an affirmative vote of those holding and voting two-thirds of the votes present in person or by proxy, may resolve to convert the bank into a federal savings institution;

2. A copy of the minutes of the meeting duly certified by the president or vice-president and the secretary or assistant secretary of the state bank shall be transmitted to the Commission;

3. Thereafter, the state bank shall take such action as is necessary under federal law to make it a federal savings institution; and

4. The bank shall file with the Commission a certified copy of the charter issued to it by the federal chartering authority, or a certificate of that authority showing the organization of the bank as a federal savings institution.

B. Upon the filing of the certified copy of a charter or certificate of authority as provided in subdivision A 4, the bank shall cease to be a state bank.

C. No state bank shall convert into a federal savings institution until it has been in operation as a state bank for a period of at least five years.

D. When a conversion of a state bank into federal savings institution becomes effective, the state bank shall cease to be a Virginia corporation and all its property, by operation of law and without any further act or deed, shall continue to be vested in it under its new name as a federal savings institution and under its federal charter. The federal savings institution shall have, hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the same was possessed, held and enjoyed by it as a state bank. The federal savings institution, at the time of the taking effect of the conversion, shall become and continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the state bank including taxes and other liabilities created by law or incurred by it before becoming a federal savings institution to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.
