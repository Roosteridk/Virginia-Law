# § 38.2-2108 Standards for content of fire insurance policies.

A. The Commission may establish standards for the content of any policy or any rider, endorsement or other supplemental agreement or provision for use in connection with any policy written to insure owner-occupied dwellings which is to be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth.

B. Following adoption of the standards of content and notwithstanding the provisions of §§ [38.2-2104](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2104/), [38.2-2105](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2105/) and [38.2-2106](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2106/), no insurer shall issue or renew any policy or any rider, endorsement, or other supplemental agreement or provision for use in connection with any policy written to insure owner-occupied dwellings unless the policy form has been filed with the Commission. The Commission shall determine whether the policy form meets the standards of content and is in compliance with any other statutory requirements.

C. Nothing in this section prevents an insurer from issuing policies with coverages, terms and conditions which are broader and more favorable to the insured than the standards established by the Commission. The language, style and format of the coverages, terms and conditions shall be consistent with the language, style and format of the entire policy form.
