1. Communication between beekeepers and applicators;

2. Reduction of the risk to pollinators from pesticides;

3. Increases in pollinator habitat;

4. Maintenance of existing compliance with state pesticide use requirements;

5. Identification of needs for further research to promote robust agriculture and apiary industries; and

6. Identification of additional opportunities for education and outreach on pollinators.
