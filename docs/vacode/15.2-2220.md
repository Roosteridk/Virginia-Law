# § 15.2-2220 Duplicate planning commission authorized for certain local governments.

The Cities of Chesapeake and Hampton may by ordinance establish a duplicate planning commission solely for the purpose of considering matters arising from the provisions of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (§ [62.1-44.15:67](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:67/) et seq.). Sections [15.2-2210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2210/) through [15.2-2222](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2222/) shall apply to the commission, mutatis mutandis.

The procedure, timing requirements and appeal to the circuit court set forth in §§ [15.2-2258](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2258/) through [15.2-2261](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2261/) shall apply to the considerations of this commission, mutatis mutandis.

To distinguish the planning commission authorized by this section from planning commissions required by § [15.2-2210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2210/), the commission established hereunder shall have the words "Chesapeake Bay Preservation" in its title.

The governing body of a city that establishes a commission pursuant to this section, in its sole discretion by ordinance, may abolish the duplicate planning commission.
