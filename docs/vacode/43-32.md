B. In the case of any boat or aircraft subject to a chattel mortgage, security agreement, deed of trust, or other instrument securing money, the keeper of the marina, hangar, or tie-down shall have a lien thereon for his reasonable charges for storage under this section not to exceed $500 and for alteration and repair under ยง [43-33](/vacode/43-33/) not to exceed $1,000.

Notwithstanding a redelivery, the watercraft shall be subject to subsection D.

C.
