# ยง 30-58.3 Annual report on state spending.

A. No later than November 15 of each year, the Commission shall provide to the Governor and the General Assembly an annual report on state spending to be published as a state document that shall include, among other things, (i) an identification and analysis of spending functions and programs that could be consolidated with other programs without diminishing the quality of the services provided to the citizens of the Commonwealth; (ii) an identification and analysis of those spending functions or programs which no longer have a distinct and discernible mission or are not performing their missions efficiently; (iii) an identification and analysis of the state programs that have had the largest impact on the growth of state spending over the prior five biennia, in dollar terms; (iv) an identification and analysis of the programs growing the fastest in percentage terms; (v) for the programs identified as the largest or fastest-growing, comparisons of the growth in spending on those programs to the rate of increase in inflation and the growth in populations served by those programs over a comparable time period; (vi) an analysis of the causes for the growth in spending on the largest and fastest-growing programs and whether the growth in spending appears rationally related to the rates of increase in inflation, tax relief measures, mandated expenditures, populations served, or any other related matter; and (vii) such other related issues as it deems appropriate.

B. All agencies of the Commonwealth shall provide assistance to the Commission in the preparation of this report, upon request.
