# § 16.1-105 Attachments.

The proceedings on any attachment brought in a court not of record shall conform to the provisions of Chapter 20 (§ [8.01-533](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-533/) et seq.) of Title 8.01, but if an attachment is returned executed and the defendant has not been served with a copy thereof, and the amount claimed in the attachment does not exceed $500, exclusive of interest and any attorney's fees contracted for in the instrument, the judge or clerk of the court, upon affidavit in conformity with §§ [8.01-316](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-316/) and [8.01-317](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-317/), shall forthwith cause a copy of the attachment to be posted at the front door of the courthouse of the county or the front door of the courtroom of the city or town wherein the attachment was issued, and shall file a certificate of the fact with the papers in the case, and, in addition to such posting, the plaintiff in the attachment or his attorney shall give to the judge or his clerk the last known address or place of abode of the defendant, verified by affidavit, and the judge or clerk shall forthwith mail a copy of the attachment to the defendant at his last known address or place of abode, or if the defendant be a corporation, at its last known address. The mailing of the copy as herein required shall be certified by the judge or clerk in writing, and such certification shall be filed with the papers in the case. Fifteen days after the copy of the attachment has been posted and a copy thereof mailed as herein required, the court may hear and decide the attachment. If the amount claimed in the attachment is more than $500, exclusive of interest and any attorney's fees contracted for in the instrument, an order of publication shall be entered and published and other proceedings had in accordance with the provisions of §§ [8.01-316](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-316/), [8.01-317](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-317/), [8.01-318](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-318/), and [8.01-320](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-320/). Personal service on a nonresident defendant out of this Commonwealth as provided in § [8.01-320](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-320/) shall have the same effect, and no other, as an order of publication duly executed or the posting and mailing of a copy of the attachment as provided herein.

If any such attachment is levied on real estate, the court shall not take cognizance of the case, but the same shall be forthwith removed to a court of record having jurisdiction of other actions removed therefrom, to be further proceeded with in such court of record as if the attachment had originated therein.
