# § 6.2-1522 Other limitations on interest.

A. Any loan made under the provisions of this chapter that is properly scheduled in a bankruptcy proceeding shall bear interest against any party to the loan from 90 days after the date of adjudication, whether there is an ultimate discharge or an extension, if any interest is allowable at all, at six percent per year. This limitation shall not apply (i) to a comaker not currently in bankruptcy when the bankrupt is not entitled to a discharge, or (ii) if the particular obligation is not dischargeable under the provisions of Title 11 of the United States Code.

B. After 90 days from the date of the death of the borrower, no other charges than interest at six percent per year shall be computed or collected from any party to the loan upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan.

C. For the period beginning six months after the date of maturity, as originally scheduled or as deferred in the event of deferment, of any loan contract under the provisions of this chapter, no further charges than interest at six percent per year shall be computed or collected from any party to the loan upon the unpaid balance of the loan.
