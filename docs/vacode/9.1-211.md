# § 9.1-211 Certification of cigarette testing.

A. Each manufacturer shall submit to the Director written certification attesting that each cigarette has been tested in accordance with and has met the performance standard required under § [9.1-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-210/).

B. The description of each cigarette listed in the certification shall include:

1. The brand;

2. The style;

3. The length in millimeters;

4. The circumference in millimeters;

5. The flavor, if applicable;

6. Whether filter or nonfilter;

7. A package description, such as soft pack or box;

8. The mark approved in accordance with § [9.1-212](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-212/);

9. The name, address, and telephone number of the laboratory, if different than the manufacturer that conducted the test; and

10. The date that the testing occurred.

C. On request, the certification shall be made available to the Attorney General, the Director, and the State Fire Marshal.

D. Each cigarette certified under this section shall be recertified every three years.

E. If a manufacturer has certified a cigarette pursuant to this section, and thereafter makes any change to such cigarette that is likely to alter its compliance with the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards mandated by this chapter, then before such cigarette may be sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth such manufacturer shall retest such cigarette in accordance with the testing standards prescribed in § [9.1-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-210/) and maintain records of such retesting as required by § [9.1-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-210/). Any such altered cigarette that does not meet the performance standard set forth in § [9.1-210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-210/) shall not be sold in the Commonwealth.

F. For each brand style of cigarette listed in a certification, a manufacturer shall pay a fee in the amount of $250; however, the Director in consultation with the State Fire Marshal is authorized to adjust the amount of the fee annually to ensure that the amount collected therefrom defrays the actual costs of the processing, testing, enforcement, and oversight activities required by this chapter. The fees assessed under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury and shall be deposited into a special fund designated "Cigarette Fire Safety Standard and Firefighter Protection Act Fund." Moneys deposited into the special fund and the unexpended balance thereof shall be appropriated to the Department of Fire Programs for use by the Director to conduct the processing, testing, enforcement, and oversight activities required by this chapter and performed by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to § [9.1-206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-206/) in carrying out the provisions of the Statewide Fire Prevention Code Act (§ [27-94](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/27-94/) et seq.), and such expenditures from the special fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Director.
