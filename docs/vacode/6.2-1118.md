# § 6.2-1118 Certificate of authority to do business.

A. Before any state savings institution may begin business in the Commonwealth, it shall obtain from the Commission a certificate of authority to do so. Prior to issuing a certificate, the Commission shall ascertain that:

1. All applicable provisions of law have been complied with;

2. If a mutual association, deposits in a total amount deemed by the Commission to be sufficient to warrant successful operation but not less than $2 million, have been pledged or deposited and that such deposits shall not be withdrawable for at least one year;

3. If a stock association, that financially responsible persons have subscribed for capital stock and surplus in an amount deemed by the Commission to be sufficient to warrant successful operation, provided that the capital stock shall have a paid-in value of not less than $2 million;

4. If a mutual savings bank, deposits in such amount as the Commission deems necessary for safe and sound operation, but not less than $1 million have been pledged or deposited and that such deposits are not subject to withdrawal for at least one year;

5. If a stock savings bank, that financially responsible persons have subscribed for capital stock in an amount deemed by the Commission to be sufficient to warrant successful operation, provided that the capital stock shall have a paid-in value of not less than $1 million;

6. Regulations governing directors of the association have been complied with;

7. The public interest will be served by the addition of the proposed savings institution facilities in the community where the savings institution is to be located. The addition of such facilities shall be deemed in the public interest if, based on all relevant evidence and information, advantages such as increased competition, additional convenience, or gains in efficiency outweigh possible adverse effects such as diminished or unfair competition, undue concentration of resources, conflicts of interests, or unsafe or unsound practices;

8. The officers and directors of the proposed savings institution demonstrate (i) moral fitness, (ii) financial responsibility, and (iii) business ability; and

9. The applicant has submitted evidence of (i) being fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency or (ii) commitment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency that the applicant will be issued insurance of accounts immediately subsequent to the issuance of the certificate of authority. The Commission may issue a certificate conditioned upon the fact that the savings institution shall not commence to do business until it is issued insurance of accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency.
