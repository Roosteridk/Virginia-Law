# ยง 28.2-623 Excusing rent payment on condemned oyster grounds in the Lynnhaven River and tributaries.

Whenever leased oyster ground in the Lynnhaven River and its tributaries has been condemned by the Commissioner of the State Department of Health for not less than 180 consecutive days, other than regular seasonal condemnation, the lessee, after prior written notice to the Commission, may choose not to pay the rent on the condemned acreage for the year immediately following the year in which the one hundred eightieth day of condemnation occurs. This choice may continue until the condemnation is terminated. However, if the lessee makes such a choice, (i) oysters or clams shall not be taken from such leased area by the lessee for any reason during the condemnation period; (ii) the lease shall continue to run; and (iii) the lessee may renew the lease as provided by law. The Commissioner may not make a new lease assignment or transfer an existing lease that lies wholly or partially within a condemned area unless the applicant executes a release that he will not exercise his rights under this section for the duration of the lease.
