A. Upon the failure of a parent to comply with the provisions of § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/), the school board may, by petition to the juvenile and domestic relations court, proceed against such parent for willful and unreasonable refusal to participate in efforts to improve the student's behavior as follows:

1. If the court finds that the parent has willfully and unreasonably failed to meet, pursuant to a request of the principal as set forth in subsection D of § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/), to review the school board's standards of student conduct and the parent's responsibility to assist the school in disciplining the student, maintaining order, or ensuring the child's school attendance, and to discuss improvement of the child's behavior, school attendance, or educational progress, it may order the parent to so meet; or

2. If the court finds that the parent has willfully and unreasonably failed to accompany a suspended student to meet with school officials pursuant to subsection F of § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/), or upon the student receiving a second suspension or being expelled, it may order (i) the student or his parent to participate in such programs or such treatment as the court deems appropriate to improve the student's behavior, including, but not limited to, extended day programs and summer school or other education programs and counseling, or (ii) the student or his parent to be subject to such conditions and limitations as the court deems appropriate for the supervision, care, and rehabilitation of the student or his parent; in addition, the court may order the parent to pay a civil penalty not to exceed $500.

The court may use its contempt power to enforce any order entered under this section.

B. The civil penalties established pursuant to this section shall be enforceable in the juvenile and domestic relations court or its successor in interest in which the student's school is located and shall be paid into a fund maintained by the appropriate local governing body to support programs or treatments designed to improve the behavior and school attendance of students as described in subdivision 2 of subsection G of § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/). Upon the failure to pay any civil penalties imposed by this section and § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/), the attorney for the appropriate county, city, or town shall enforce the collection of such civil penalties.

C. For the purposes of this section and § [22.1-279.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-279.3/), "parent" or "parents" means any parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person having control or charge of a child.
