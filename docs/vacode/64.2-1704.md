# ยง 64.2-1704 Guardian's bond.

A. Before any person may be appointed the guardian for the estate of a minor, the person, in the circuit court or before the circuit court clerk, shall take an oath that he will faithfully perform the duties of his office to the best of his judgment and give his bond in an amount at least equal to the value of the minor's personal estate coming under his control.

B. Every guardian for the estate of a minor shall provide surety upon his bond unless it is waived pursuant to ยง [64.2-1411](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1411/) or, in the case of a testamentary guardian, it is waived by the testator's will. However, upon the motion of the court or clerk or upon the motion of another interested person, the court or clerk may at any time require surety upon a guardian's bond. Every order appointing a guardian shall state whether or not surety is required.

C. If the same guardian qualifies upon the estate of two or more minors who are members of the same family, such guardian shall only be required to give one guardianship bond.
