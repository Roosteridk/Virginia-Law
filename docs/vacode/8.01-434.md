# ยง 8.01-434 Lien of such judgments.

The clerk shall record in the proper book any judgment confessed under the provisions of ยง [8.01-432](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-432/) and the day and hour when the same was confessed, and the lien thereof shall attach and be binding from the time such judgment is recorded on the judgment lien docket of the clerk's office of the county or city in which land of the defendant lies. If the credit was extended for personal, family or household purposes, the judgment shall not be a lien against the real estate of the obligor or the basis of obtaining execution against his personal property until the expiration of the 21-day period allowed the judgment debtor as set forth in ยง [8.01-433](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-433/). In the event the judgment debtor files a motion or other pleading within such 21-day period, the judgment shall not be a lien against such real estate or its basis of execution against personal property until an order to that effect is entered by the court. It will be presumed that the obligation is for personal, family or household purposes if the debtor is a natural person, unless the plaintiff or someone on his behalf makes oath or makes out and files an affidavit that the obligation was not for such purposes, or the obligation for which judgment is confessed recites that it is for other purposes.
