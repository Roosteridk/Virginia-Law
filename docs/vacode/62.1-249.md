C. The Board may impose such restrictions on one or more classes of water uses as may be necessary to protect the surface water resources of the area from serious harm.

D. Regulations shall provide for the means for a declaration of water shortage to be rescinded.

E. When permit conditions become applicable in a surface water management area, the Board shall notify each permittee by mail or cause notice thereof to be published in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the area. Publication of such notice will serve as notice to all permit holders in the area.
