# ยง 15.2-6302 Establishment of development authorities.

With regard to an authority created by the Governor, there is hereby created with respect to every former federal area a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, with such public and corporate powers as are set forth in this chapter. Each such authority shall be designated as the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Development Authority (with a name chosen by the Governor descriptive of the area in which the property is located); however, no authority shall exercise any power or transact any business hereunder unless or until the Governor upon receipt of a duly certified resolution of the governing body of each of the localities within the area of operation of an authority requesting such action, shall proclaim that a former federal area exists with respect to which an authority should function under the terms of this chapter. Any such authority for which such a proclamation has been issued may proceed to transact business and to exercise its powers hereunder at any time after the selection of the commissioners of the authority, as set forth in ยง [15.2-6304](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-6304/).

Alternatively, the governing body of the City of Hampton may by ordinance create a development authority for the development or redevelopment of federal areas. The ordinance creating such an authority shall not be adopted or approved until a public hearing has been held on the question of its adoption or approval.

In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of or action by the authority, the authority shall be conclusively presumed to have been established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder (i) upon proof of the action of the Governor in issuing a proclamation with reference to such authority and the designation of its name by the Governor, which descriptive name can be altered by the authority as may be deemed expedient, or (ii) upon the adoption and approval of an ordinance by the City of Hampton in accordance with this section.
