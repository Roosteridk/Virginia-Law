The local planning commission may expend, under regular local procedure as provided by law, sums appropriated to it for its purposes and activities.

A locality may accept gifts and donations for commission purposes. Any moneys so accepted shall be deposited with the appropriate governing body in a special nonreverting commission fund to be available for expenditure by the commission for the purpose designated by the donor. The disbursing officer of the locality may issue warrants against such special fund only upon vouchers signed by the chairman and the secretary of the commission.
