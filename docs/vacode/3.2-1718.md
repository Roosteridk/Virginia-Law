# ยง 3.2-1718 Referenda.

If the Governor issues a proclamation under ยง [3.2-1716](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-1716/), then no other referendum shall be held on the equine industry that was the subject of the proclamation except that after the expiration of five years from the date of the imposition of the assessment on manufactured equine feed, another referendum may be held in the manner herein prescribed to determine whether the assessment shall be continued or adjusted. The Board, upon petition by members of the equine industry representing at least 10 percent of the number of members of the equine industry who voted in the preceding referendum, or as determined by the Commissioner, may provide for a referendum on the continuation or adjustment of the assessment. The Board shall not act on such a petition for conducting such a referendum until at least five years have passed from the time the manufactured equine feed assessment was established or until at least five years have passed since the last referendum.

If the Governor determines that a simple majority is not in favor of the assessment, the Board shall hold no new referendum for at least one year after the Governor has declared his findings, but, at the expiration of one year and upon petition by 10 percent of the members of the Commonwealth's equine industry that voted in the most recent referendum, the Board may provide for a referendum. The cost of conducting any referendum under this section may be paid from the Virginia Horse Industry Promotion and Development Fund.
