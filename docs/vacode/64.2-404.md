# ยง 64.2-404 Writings intended as wills.

A. Although a document, or a writing added upon a document, was not executed in compliance with ยง [64.2-403](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-403/), the document or writing shall be treated as if it had been executed in compliance with ยง [64.2-403](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-403/) if the proponent of the document or writing establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document or writing to constitute (i) the decedent's will, (ii) a partial or complete revocation of the will, (iii) an addition to or an alteration of the will, or (iv) a partial or complete revival of his formerly revoked will or of a formerly revoked portion of the will.

B. The remedy granted by this section (i) may not be used to excuse compliance with any requirement for a testator's signature, except in circumstances where two persons mistakenly sign each other's will, or a person signs the self-proving certificate to a will instead of signing the will itself and (ii) is available only in proceedings brought in a circuit court under the appropriate provisions of this title, filed within one year from the decedent's date of death and in which all interested persons are made parties.
