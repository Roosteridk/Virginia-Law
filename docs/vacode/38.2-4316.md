# § 38.2-4316 Suspension or revocation of license.

A. The Commission may suspend or revoke any license issued to a health maintenance organization under this chapter if it finds that any of the following conditions exist:

1. The health maintenance organization is operating significantly at variance with its basic organizational document, its health care plan, or in a manner contrary to that described in and reasonably inferred from any other information submitted under § [38.2-4301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-4301/), unless amendments to those submissions have been filed with and approved by the Commission;

2. The health maintenance organization issues an evidence of coverage or uses a schedule of charges for health care services that do not comply with the requirements of § [38.2-4306](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-4306/);

3. The health care plan does not provide or arrange for basic health care services or limited health care services;

4. The health maintenance organization is no longer financially responsible and a reasonable expectation exists that it may be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective enrollees;

5. The health maintenance organization has failed to implement a mechanism providing the enrollees with an opportunity to participate in matters of policy and operation as provided in § [38.2-4304](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-4304/);

6. The health maintenance organization, or any person on its behalf, has advertised or merchandised its services in an untrue, misrepresentative, misleading, deceptive, or unfair manner;

7. The continued operation of the health maintenance organization would be hazardous to its enrollees; or

8. The health maintenance organization has otherwise failed to substantially comply with the provisions of this chapter.

B. When the license of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization shall not enroll any additional enrollees during the period of the suspension except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation.

C. The Commission shall not revoke or suspend the license of a health maintenance organization upon any of the grounds set out in subsection A of this section until it has given the organization ten days' notice of the proposed revocation or suspension and the grounds for it, and has given the organization an opportunity to introduce evidence and be heard. Any hearing authorized by this section may be informal. The required notice may be waived by the Commission and the health maintenance organization.

D. When the license of a health maintenance organization is revoked, the organization shall proceed to wind up its affairs immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation. The health maintenance organization shall conduct no further business except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of its affairs. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation. The Commission may, by written order, permit further operation of the organization that it finds to be in the best interests of enrollees for the purpose of giving them the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.
