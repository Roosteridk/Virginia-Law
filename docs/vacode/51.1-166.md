# § 51.1-166 Post-retirement supplements generally.

A. In addition to the allowances payable under this title, post-retirement supplements shall be payable to the recipients of such allowances. Supplements shall be subject to the same conditions of payment as are allowances.

B. The amounts of the post-retirement supplements shall be determined as percentages of the allowances supplemented hereby. The percentages shall be determined annually by reference to the increase in the United States Average Consumer Price Index for all items, all urban consumers (CPI-U), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The percentages shall be based on monthly averages and shall be the difference between (i) the average for the calendar year just ended and (ii) the average for the most recent calendar year used in the determination of the post-retirement supplements currently being paid. The annual increase, if any, in the CPI-U shall be considered only to the extent of the first two percent plus one-half of the next two percent of any additional increase, or a maximum increase in the post-retirement supplement of three percent in any given year. However, for anyone who (a) is not a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, and (b) has at least 60 months of creditable service as of January 1, 2013, the applicable annual increase, if any, in the CPI-U shall be considered only to the extent of the first three percent plus one-half of the next four percent of any additional increase, or a maximum increase in the post-retirement supplement of five percent in any given year. If the difference in the percentages determined above is zero or less, the post-retirement supplements shall either not commence or shall continue unchanged until such time as an annual determination results in a difference in the percentages that are greater than zero. A participant in the hybrid retirement program described in § [51.1-169](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-169/) shall be considered to be a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, for the purposes of this section.

Contribution rates for all employers shall include an amount equal to 100 percent of the total annual amount necessary to fund all post-retirement supplements. All contribution rates shall be computed in accordance with recognized actuarial principles on the basis of methods and assumptions approved by the Board.

C. There shall be no change in the amount of any post-retirement supplement between determination dates except as necessary to reflect changes in the amount of the allowance being supplemented. The post-retirement supplement shall remain a constant percentage of the respective allowance being supplemented. No new post-retirement supplement shall be commenced except as of a determination date. The post-retirement supplement determined as of any determination dates shall become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year and shall be in lieu of any post-retirement supplements previously payable, which shall thereupon be terminated.

D. 1. Any recipient of an allowance which initially commenced on or prior to January 1, 1990, shall be entitled to post-retirement supplements effective July 1, 1991.

2. A person who is the recipient of an allowance pursuant to § [2.2-3204](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3204/), subsection Q of Item 469 of Chapter 890 of the Acts of Assembly of 2011, or § [51.1-155.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-155.1/), [51.1-155.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-155.2/), [51.1-157](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-157/), [51.1-162](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-162/), [51.1-207](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-207/), [51.1-218](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-218/), [51.1-308](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-308/), [51.1-1117](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1117/), [51.1-1128](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1128/), [51.1-1161](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1161/), or [51.1-1169](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1169/) must receive that allowance for one full calendar year before being entitled to post-retirement supplements.

3. Any person who, as of January 1, 2013, (i) is the recipient of an allowance under this title or (ii) would otherwise be eligible for an unreduced allowance under the applicable chapter within five years, including a person described in clause (ii) who commences an unreduced allowance on or after January 1, 2013, must receive that allowance for one full calendar year before being entitled to post-retirement supplements.

4. Any other person who has less than 20 years of creditable service must receive that allowance for one full calendar year after the date he would otherwise have been eligible for an unreduced allowance under the applicable chapter before being entitled to post-retirement supplements.
