# ยง 19.2-368.10 When awards to be made; reporting crime and cooperation with law enforcement.

No award shall be made unless the Commission finds that:

1. A crime was committed;

2. Such crime directly resulted in an individual becoming a victim as defined in ยง [19.2-368.2](/vacode/19.2-368.2/), on whose behalf a claim is filed; and

3. Police records show that such crime was promptly reported to the proper authorities. In no case may an award be made where the police records show that such report was made more than 120 hours after the occurrence of such crime, unless the Commission, for good cause shown, finds the delay to have been justified. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to claims of sexual abuse.

The Commission, upon finding that any claimant or award recipient has not fully cooperated with all law-enforcement agencies, may deny, reduce or withdraw any award, as the case may be.
