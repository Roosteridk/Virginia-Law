"Locality" means any city or county or the school board with authority over public schools within the boundaries of a city or county.

B. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the governing bodies of three or more localities that as of December 31, 2014, comprised the membership of a multiple employer welfare arrangement may form a not-for-profit benefits consortium for the purpose of establishing a self-funded employee welfare benefits plan by acting as incorporators of a nonstock corporation pursuant to the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-801](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-801/) et seq.).

Require that each initial member of the corporation and each additional locality admitted to membership agree to remain a member of the benefits consortium for a period of at least five years from the date the consortium begins operations or the date of the additional locality's admission to membership, as the case may be;

6. Provide that the number of directors of the corporation shall be equal to the number of members;

7. Provide that the board of directors shall have exclusive fiscal control over and be responsible for the operation of the benefits plan and shall govern the benefits consortium in accordance with applicable law;

10. Provide that each member shall be contractually liable for its allocated share of the liabilities of the benefits consortium as determined by the board of directors;

11. Require that the benefits consortium purchase and maintain (i) a bond that satisfies the requirements of applicable law, (ii) fiduciary liability insurance, and (iii) a policy or policies of excess insurance with a retention level determined in accordance with sound actuarial principles from an insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in the Commonwealth;

12. Require that the benefits consortium be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant engaged by the board of directors; and

13. Not include in the name of the corporation the words "insurance," "insurer," "underwriter," "mutual," or any other word or term or combination of words or terms that is uniquely descriptive of an insurance company or insurance business unless the context of the remaining words or terms clearly indicates that the corporation is not an insurance company and is not carrying on the business of insurance.

C. A benefits consortium shall establish and maintain reserves determined in accordance with sound actuarial principles. Capital may be maintained in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit issued to the benefits consortium by a state or national bank authorized to engage in the banking business in the Commonwealth.

D. A benefits consortium may create a self-funded trust through which the members provide for their employees and their dependents any benefit that a member that is a locality is authorized to provide under an accident and health insurance program authorized by § [15.2-1517](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1517/).
