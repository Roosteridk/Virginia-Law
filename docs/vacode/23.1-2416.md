# § 23.1-2416 Retirement benefits for employees of the Authority.

A. The Authority may establish and determine the effective date of one or more retirement plans covering in whole or in part its employees, including employees who, prior to the effective date of any plan established pursuant to this section, participated in any plan established pursuant to § [51.1-126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126/) or [51.1-126.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126.1/) or former § 51.1-126.2. The Authority may make contributions for the benefit of its employees who elect to participate in such plan or arrangement rather than in any other retirement system established by Chapter 1 (§ [51.1-124.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/) et seq.) of Title 51.1.

B. Except in the case of an employee of the Authority hired prior to July 1, 1998, who made an irrevocable election to participate in the retirement plan established by Chapter 1 (§ [51.1-124.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/) et seq.) of Title 51.1 or any plan previously established by the Authority in accordance with guidelines established by the Authority, each eligible employee of the Authority shall participate in a plan established by the Authority pursuant to subsection A.

C. No employee of the Authority who is an active member of a plan established pursuant to subsection A shall also be an active member of the retirement system established pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ [51.1-124.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/) et seq.) of Title 51.1 or a beneficiary of such retirement system other than as a contingent annuitant.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the contribution by the Authority to any other retirement plan established pursuant to subsection A on behalf of employees of the Authority hired before July 1, 1998, shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the contribution the Commonwealth would be required to make if the employee were a member of the retirement system established by Chapter 1 (§ [51.1-124.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/) et seq.) of Title 51.1 or (ii) eight percent of creditable compensation. The contribution by the Authority to any retirement plan established pursuant to subsection A on behalf of employees of the Authority hired on or after July 1, 1998, shall be determined by the board.

E. If the University has adopted a retirement plan under § [51.1-126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126/) for its employees who are engaged in the performance of teaching, administrative, or research duties, the plan established by the Authority pursuant to subsection A shall offer similar investment opportunities as are available to the participants of the plan established pursuant to § [51.1-126](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-126/).

F. The Authority shall develop policies and procedures for the administration of any retirement plan established by the Authority pursuant to subsection A. A copy of such policies and procedures shall be filed with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System.
