# § 50-73.57:2 Merger of foreign limited partnership registered to transact business in Commonwealth.

A. Whenever a foreign limited partnership that is registered to transact business in the Commonwealth is a party to a merger permitted by the laws of the state or other jurisdiction under whose laws it is formed, and that limited partnership is the surviving entity of the merger, it shall, within 30 days after the merger becomes effective, file with the Commission a copy of the instrument of merger duly authenticated by the Secretary of State or other official having custody of limited partnership records in the state or other jurisdiction under whose laws the merger was effected. However, the filing shall not be required when a foreign limited partnership merges with a domestic corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, business trust, or partnership; the foreign limited partnership's certificate of limited partnership or, if there is no such certificate, partnership agreement or other constituent document, is not amended by the merger; and the articles or statement of merger filed on behalf of the domestic corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, business trust, or partnership pursuant to § [13.1-720](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-720/), [13.1-1072](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1072/), [13.1-1261](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1261/), [50-73.48:3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.48:3/), or [50-73.131](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.131/) contains a statement that the merger is permitted under the laws of the state or other jurisdiction in which the foreign limited partnership is formed and that the foreign limited partnership has complied with that law in effecting the merger.

B. Whenever a foreign limited partnership that is registered to transact business in the Commonwealth is a party to a merger permitted by the laws of the state or other jurisdiction under the laws of which it is formed, and that limited partnership is not the surviving entity of the merger, the surviving partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, business trust, or corporation shall, if not continuing to transact business in the Commonwealth, within 30 days after the merger becomes effective, deliver to the Commission a copy of the instrument of merger duly authenticated by the Secretary of State or other official having custody of limited partnership records in the state or other jurisdiction under whose laws the merger was effected, and comply in behalf of the predecessor limited partnership with § [50-73.58](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.58/). If a surviving business trust, registered limited liability partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or corporation is to continue to transact business in the Commonwealth and has not registered with the Commission as a foreign registered limited liability partnership under § [50-73.138](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.138/), as a foreign limited partnership under § [50-73.54](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.54/), as a foreign business trust under § [13.1-1242](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1242/), or as a foreign limited liability company under § [13.1-1052](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1052/) or received a certificate of authority to transact business in the Commonwealth as a foreign corporation, as the case may be, it shall, within 30 days after the merger becomes effective, deliver to the Commission an application, if a foreign registered limited liability partnership, for registration as a foreign registered limited liability partnership, if a foreign limited partnership, for registration as a foreign limited partnership, if a foreign limited liability company, for registration as a foreign limited liability company, if a foreign business trust, for registration as a foreign business trust, or, if a foreign corporation, for a certificate of authority to transact business in the Commonwealth, together with a duly authenticated copy of the instrument of merger and also a copy of its partnership certificate, statement of registered limited liability partnership, certificate of limited partnership, articles of organization, articles of trust, or articles of incorporation and all amendments thereto, duly authenticated by the Secretary of State or other official having custody of registered limited liability partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, business trust, or corporate records in the state or other jurisdiction under whose laws it is formed, organized, registered, or incorporated.

C. Upon the merger of a foreign limited partnership with one or more foreign partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, business trusts, or corporations, all property in the Commonwealth owned by the foreign limited partnership shall pass to the surviving foreign partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, business trust, or corporation except as otherwise provided by the laws of the state or other jurisdiction by which it is governed, but only from and after the time when a duly authenticated copy of the instrument of merger is filed with the Commission.
