Even if the court has authorized administration of antipsychotic medication or electroconvulsive therapy hereunder, these treatments may be administered over the person's objection only if he is subject to an order of involuntary admission, including involuntary outpatient treatment, previously or simultaneously issued under §§ [37.2-814](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-814/) through [37.2-819](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-819/) or Chapter 9 (§ [37.2-900](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-900/) et seq.), or the provisions of Chapter 11 (§ [19.2-167](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-167/) et seq.) or Chapter 11.1 (§ [19.2-182.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-182.2/) et seq.) of Title 19.2.
