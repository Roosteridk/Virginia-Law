# § 20-185 Authority of tribunal in case of noncompliance.

A. If a collaborative law participation agreement fails to meet the requirements of § [20-170](/vacode/20-170/), or a lawyer fails to comply with § [20-179](/vacode/20-179/) or [20-180](/vacode/20-180/), a tribunal may nevertheless find that the parties intended to enter into a collaborative law participation agreement if they (i) signed a record indicating an intention to enter into a collaborative law participation agreement and (ii) reasonably believed they were participating in a collaborative law process.

B. If a tribunal makes the findings specified in subsection A, and the interests of justice require, the tribunal may (i) enforce an agreement evidenced by a record resulting from the collaborative law process in which the parties participated, (ii) apply the disqualification provisions of § [20-175](/vacode/20-175/), and (iii) apply a privilege under § [20-182](/vacode/20-182/).
