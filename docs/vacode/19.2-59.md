No officer of the law or any other person shall search any place, thing or person, except by virtue of and under a warrant issued by a proper officer.

Any officer found guilty of a second offense under this section shall, upon conviction thereof, immediately forfeit his office, and such finding shall be deemed to create a vacancy in such office to be filled according to law.
