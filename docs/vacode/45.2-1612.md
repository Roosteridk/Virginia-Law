A. If the well operator and the objecting coal owners who are present or represented at a hearing to consider the objections to the proposed drilling unit or location are unable to agree upon a drilling unit or location for a new well within 2,500 linear feet of the location of an existing well or a well for which a permit application is on file, then the permit or drilling unit shall be refused.

B. The distance limitation established by this section shall not apply if (i) the proposed well will be drilled through an existing or planned pillar of coal required for protection of a preexisting well drilled to any depth and (ii) the proposed well will neither require enlargement of the pillar nor otherwise have an adverse effect on existing or planned coal mining operations.
