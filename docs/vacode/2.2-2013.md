# § 2.2-2013 Internal service and special funds.

A. There is established the Information Technology and Management Internal Service Fund to be administered by VITA.

B. There is established the Acquisition Services Special Fund to be administered by VITA and used to finance procurement and contracting activities and programs unallowable for federal fund reimbursement.

C. Upon written request of the CIO, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission may direct the Comptroller to establish internal service fund accounts on his books and record the receipts and expenditures for appropriate functions of VITA. Charges for services rendered sufficient to offset costs involved in these operations shall be established.

D. All users of services provided for in this chapter administered by VITA shall be assessed a surcharge, which shall be deposited in the appropriate fund. This charge shall be an amount sufficient to allow VITA to finance the operations and staff of the services offered.

E. Additional moneys necessary to establish these funds or provide for the administration of the activities of VITA may be advanced from the general account of the state treasury.

F. The CIO shall direct that the following activities be conducted with respect to VITA's internal service funds:

1. VITA shall establish fee schedules for the collection of fees from users when general fund appropriations are not available for the services rendered.

2. VITA shall develop and implement information, billing, and collections methods that will assist state agencies in analyzing and effectively managing their use of VITA's services, and which will allow VITA to forecast service demands and balances of its internal service funds.

3. By September 1 of each year, VITA shall submit biennial projections of future revenues and expenditures for each internal service fund and estimates of any anticipated changes to fee schedules to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and the Department of Planning and Budget.

4. In the event that changes to fee schedules or rates are required, the CIO shall submit documentation to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and the Department of Planning and Budget no later than September 1 prior to the fiscal year in which the new or revised rates are to take effect so that the impact of the rate changes can be considered for inclusion in the executive budget submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to § [2.2-1508](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1508/). In emergency circumstances, deviations from this approach shall be approved in advance by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.
