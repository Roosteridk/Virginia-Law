# ยง 15.2-3215 County reimbursement for town annexation proceedings.

In any annexation proceedings in which a town participates, except those in which a town declines to accept an award by the special court, in which case ยง [15.2-3213](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3213/) shall apply, the court may direct the county within which the town is located to reimburse the town, as hereinafter provided, for reasonable costs incurred by it in presenting its case. Such costs shall include attorneys' fees, engineering fees, witness fees, and other reasonable costs as the court shall determine and allow. The court shall hear evidence regarding the costs incurred by the town in presenting its annexation case and may order part payment by the county to the town based upon a consideration of the extent to which county revenues are derived from within the town, the relative financial ability of the town and county, and the relative merits of the case.
