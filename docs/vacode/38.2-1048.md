# § 38.2-1048 Return of deposits.

A. The Commission, at its discretion, may direct the State Treasurer to return to any insurer all or a part of the deposit made by it under § [38.2-1045](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1045/) if the insurer (i) has complied with § [38.2-1049](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1049/), or (ii) has ceased to transact business in this Commonwealth. In the case of the latter, the fixed or contingent liabilities secured by the deposit shall have been satisfied or terminated or shall have been assumed by another insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth. If the Commission finds that any voluntary deposit of any insurer made under § [38.2-1050](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1050/) no longer is required in whole or in part to comply with the laws of this or any other state, it may to such extent direct the return of that deposit. The Commission, before directing the return of any deposit, may require evidence it considers satisfactory that the insurer is entitled to the return of all or part of the deposit.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions in § [38.2-1046](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1046/) and subsection A of this section, if an insurer domiciled in this Commonwealth is placed in receivership, and a receiver is appointed, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ [38.2-1500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1500/) et seq.) of this title, the Commission shall direct the State Treasurer to return any deposit made with it by the insurer to such receiver for distribution, disbursement, or other application in accordance with provisions set forth in Chapter 15 (§ [38.2-1500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1500/) et seq.) of this title and any applicable order of liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation.
