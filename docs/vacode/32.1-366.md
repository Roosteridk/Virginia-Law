For purposes of the Comptroller's preliminary and final annual reports required by § [2.2-813](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-813/), however, all deposits to and disbursements from the Fund shall be accounted for as part of the general fund of the state treasury.

B. All revenue received by the Commonwealth pursuant to the provisions of (i) §§ [58.1-1001](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1001/) and [58.1-1018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1018/), (ii) Article 2.1 (§ [58.1-1021.01](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1021.01/) et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 58.1, and (iii) § [3.2-4203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4203/) shall be paid into the state treasury and deposited to the Fund. The Comptroller shall also deposit 40 percent of the Commonwealth's allocation pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement with tobacco product manufacturers, as defined in § [3.2-3100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-3100/), to the Fund.
