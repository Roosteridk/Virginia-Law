2. Register for and audit up to three courses offered for academic credit in any one academic term, quarter, or semester for an unlimited number of academic terms, quarters, or semesters; and

3. Register for and enroll in up to three courses not offered for academic credit in any one academic term, quarter, or semester for an unlimited number of academic terms, quarters, or semesters.

B. No senior citizen who enrolls in or audits courses pursuant to subsection A shall pay tuition or fees except fees established for the purpose of paying for course materials such as laboratory fees.
