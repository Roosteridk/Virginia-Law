# ยง 20-49.6 Proceedings to establish paternity or enforce support obligations of males between the ages of fourteen and eighteen.

In any proceeding to establish or enforce an obligation for support and maintenance of a child of unwed parents, a male between the ages of fourteen and eighteen who is represented by a guardian ad litem pursuant to ยง [8.01-9](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-9/) and who has not otherwise been emancipated shall not be deemed to be under a disability as provided in ยง [8.01-2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-2/). The court may enter an order establishing the paternity of the child based upon an admission of paternity by such male made under oath before the court or upon such other evidence as may be sufficient in law to support a finding of paternity. The order may provide for support and maintenance of the child by the father and shall be enforceable as if the father were an adult.
