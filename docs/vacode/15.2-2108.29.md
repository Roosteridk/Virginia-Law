# ยง 15.2-2108.29 Surrender.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, a new cable franchisee that considers, within three years after the grant of a cable franchise under this article, that its provision of cable services within the locality is no longer economically feasible may notify the locality and surrender its cable franchise for the entire locality without liability to such locality. If a new cable franchisee surrenders its cable service franchise, it shall not be eligible to obtain a new cable service franchise within such locality until after the normal expiration date of the franchise that such franchisee surrendered. Such surrender of a cable franchise shall have no impact on other franchises held by the new cable franchisee or noncable services offered by the new cable franchisee.
