# § 46.2-400 Suspension of license of person not competent to drive; restoration of license; duty of clerk of the court.

A. The Commissioner, on receipt of notice from a court, shall suspend the license of any person who has been legally adjudged to be incapacitated in accordance with Article 1 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) of Chapter 20 of Title 64.2. No driver's license shall be issued to any applicant who has previously been adjudged incapacitated and not competent to drive unless, at the time of such application, (i) the applicant has been adjudged restored to capacity by judicial decree or has a court order restoring or retaining the privilege to drive and (ii) the Department is satisfied that the applicant is competent to drive a motor vehicle with safety to persons and property pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/). The clerk of the court in which the adjudication is made shall send a certified copy or abstract of such adjudication to the Commissioner.

B. The Commissioner shall not suspend the license or prior privilege to drive of any person legally adjudged to be incapacitated in accordance with Article 1 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) of Chapter 20 of Title 64.2, where the court order specifically permits such person to retain his driver's license or the privilege to drive or to apply for such license. In such case, the clerk of the court in which the adjudication is made shall not send a copy of the order to the Commissioner. However, a court may order any person adjudicated legally incapacitated to submit to an examination pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/). In such case, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order requiring an examination to the Department. Upon completion of the examination, the Department shall take whatever action may be appropriate and may (i) suspend the license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth, (ii) permit the examinee to retain his license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth, or (iii) issue a license subject to the restrictions authorized by § [46.2-329](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-329/).

C. Upon receipt of notice that a person has been discharged from a facility operated or licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and is, in the opinion of the authorities of the facility, not competent because of mental illness, intellectual disability, alcoholism, or drug addiction to drive a motor vehicle with safety to persons or property, the Commissioner shall forthwith suspend his license; however he shall not suspend the license if the person has been adjudged competent by judicial order or decree. The Commissioner shall require any person whose license has been suspended pursuant to this subsection to submit to an examination pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/).

In any case in which the person's license has been suspended prior to his discharge, it shall not be returned to him unless the Commissioner is satisfied, after an examination pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/), that the person is competent to drive a motor vehicle with safety to persons and property.

The facility operated or licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall send the necessary information to the Commissioner to initiate the examination process pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/).

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department reserves the right to examine any licensed driver, any person applying for a driver's license or renewal thereof, or any person whose license has been suspended or revoked to determine his fitness to drive a motor vehicle pursuant to § [46.2-322](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-322/) or [46.2-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-325/).
