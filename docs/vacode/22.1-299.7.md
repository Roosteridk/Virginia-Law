# ยง 22.1-299.7 Microcredential program; certain STEM subjects.

A. The Department of Education may establish a microcredential program for the purpose of permitting any public elementary or secondary school teacher who holds a renewable or provisional license or any individual who participates in any alternate route to licensure program to complete additional coursework and earn microcredentials in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) endorsement areas, including computer science, for which there is a high need for additional qualified teachers.

B. The Department of Education shall direct the Advisory Board on Teacher Education and Licensure to convene a workgroup including pertinent education stakeholders to determine how any microcredential awarded pursuant to any microcredential program established pursuant to subsection A will be used to award add-on endorsements and certifications for teachers in STEM endorsement areas, including computer science, for which there is a high need for additional qualified teachers.

C. Any course offered through any microcredential program established pursuant to subsection A shall be offered in-person or in a blended format of in-person and online instruction.

D. Any teacher who holds a renewable license and who participates, through any microcredential program offered pursuant to subsection A, in courses that do not contribute to an endorsement is eligible for professional development points toward renewal of his license for the number of in-person hours of coursework completed, upon providing a certificate of such participation from the course provider.
