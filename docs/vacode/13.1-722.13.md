7. The shares or eligible interests of the converting entity are reclassified into shares, eligible interests, or other securities, obligations, rights to acquire shares, eligible interests or other securities, cash, or other property in accordance with the terms of the conversion, and the shareholders or interest holders of the converting entity are entitled only to the rights provided to them by those terms and to any appraisal rights they may have under the organic law of the converting entity;

8. The converted entity is:

a. Incorporated or organized under and subject to the organic law of the converted entity;

b. The same entity without interruption as the converting entity; and

c. Deemed to have been incorporated or otherwise organized on the date that the converting entity was originally incorporated or organized.

1. Appoint the clerk of the Commission as an agent for service of process in any proceeding to (i) enforce the rights of shareholders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the conversion or (ii) based on a cause of action against a nonsurviving domestic corporation arising during the time it was in existence under the laws of the Commonwealth, which service of process shall be made on the clerk in accordance with ยง [12.1-19.1](/vacode/12.1-19.1/); and

2. The provisions of the organic law of the eligible entity shall continue to apply to the collection or discharge of any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision 1, as if the conversion had not occurred.

3. The eligible interest holder shall have such rights of contribution from other persons as are provided by the organic law of the eligible entity with respect to any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision 1, as if the conversion had not occurred.

4. The eligible interest holder shall not, by reason of such prior interest holder liability, have interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arise after the conversion becomes effective.
