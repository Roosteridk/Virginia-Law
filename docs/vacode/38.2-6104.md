# ยง 38.2-6104 License renewals.

A. Each dental plan organization organized under this chapter shall obtain an annual renewal of its license from the Commission by July 1 of each year. The Commission may refuse to renew the license of any dental plan organization or may renew the license, subject to any restrictions considered appropriate by the Commission, if it finds an impairment of the minimum capital and surplus or that the dental plan organization has not satisfied all of the conditions set forth in subsection A of ยง [38.2-6103](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-6103/).

B. The Commission shall not fail or refuse to renew the license of any dental plan organization without first giving the dental plan organization 10 days' notice of its intention not to renew the license and giving it an opportunity to be heard and to introduce evidence on its behalf. The hearing may be informal and the required notice may be waived by the Commission and the dental plan organization.
