# § 53.1-162 Arrest of parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision without warrant; written statement.

Any probation and parole officer may arrest a parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power of arrest to do so by a written statement setting forth that the parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision has, in the judgment of the probation and parole officer, violated one or more of the terms or conditions of his parole or postrelease period of supervision. Such a written statement by a probation and parole officer delivered to the officer in charge of any state or local correctional facility shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision. Any officer deputized upon receipt of the written statement shall, in accordance with § [19.2-390](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-390/), enter, or cause to be entered, the person's name and other appropriate information required by the Department of State Police into the "information systems" known as the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN), established and maintained by the Department pursuant to Chapter 2 (§ [52-12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/52-12/) et seq.) of Title 52. Such information shall be deemed a warrant authorizing the arrest of the person anywhere in the Commonwealth.
