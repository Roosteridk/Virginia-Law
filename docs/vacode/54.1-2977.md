# ยง 54.1-2977 Standards for court-authorized sterilization of certain persons.

A. In order for the circuit court to authorize the sterilization of a person in accordance with ยง [54.1-2975](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2975/) or ยง [54.1-2976](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2976/), it must be proven by clear and convincing evidence that:

1. There is a need for contraception. The court shall find that the person is engaging in sexual activity at the present time or is likely to engage in sexual activity in the near future and that pregnancy would not usually be intended by such person if such person were competent and engaging in sexual activity under similar circumstances;

2. There is no reasonable alternative method of contraception to sterilization;

3. The proposed method of sterilization conforms with standard medical practice, and the treatment can be carried out without unreasonable risk to the life and health of the person; and

4. The nature and extent of the person's mental disability renders the person permanently incapable of caring for and raising a child. The court shall base this finding on empirical evidence and not solely on standardized tests.

B. The criteria set out in subsection A of this section shall be established for the court by independent evidence based on a medical, social, and psychological evaluation of the person upon whom the sterilization operation is to be performed.
