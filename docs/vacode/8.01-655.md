# § 8.01-655 Form and contents of petition filed by prisoner.

Name and Title of Respondent

PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

Instructions--Read Carefully

In order for this petition to receive consideration by the Court, it must   
be legibly handwritten or typewritten, signed by the petitioner and verified   
before a notary or other officer authorized to administer oaths. It must set   
forth in concise form the answers to each applicable question. If necessary,   
petitioner may finish his answer to a particular question on an additional   
page. Petitioner must make it clear to which question any such continued   
answer refers. The petitioner may also submit exhibits.

Since every petition for habeas corpus must be sworn to under oath, any   
false statement of a material fact therein may serve as the basis of   
prosecution and conviction for perjury under § 18.2-434. Petitioners should,   
therefore, exercise care to assure that all answers are true and correct.

When the petition is completed, the original and two copies (total of 

three) should be mailed to the clerk of the court. The petitioner shall keep   
one copy.

NOTICE

The granting of a writ of habeas corpus does not entitle the petitioner to   
dismissal of the charges for conviction of which he is being detained, but may   
gain him no more than a new trial.
