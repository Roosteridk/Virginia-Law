# § 46.2-1038 When turn signals required; exceptions.

A. Any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which is so constructed or carries a load in such a manner as to prevent a hand and arm signal required in § [46.2-849](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-849/) from being visible both to the front and rear of such motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer or any vehicle the driver of which is incapable of giving the required hand and arm signals, shall be equipped with electrical turn signals which meet the requirements of this title and are of a type that has been approved by the Superintendent.

C. Any such turn signal may be used in lieu of the hand and arm signal required by § [46.2-849](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-849/).
