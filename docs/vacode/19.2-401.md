# ยง 19.2-401 Cross appeal; when allowed; time for filing.

The defendant shall have no independent right of appeal pursuant to ยง [19.2-398](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-398/). If the Commonwealth appeals, the defendant may cross appeal from any orders from which the Commonwealth may appeal, pursuant to ยง [19.2-398](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-398/). The defendant shall be under no obligation to defend an appeal filed by the Commonwealth. However, when an appeal is taken by the Commonwealth, and the defendant wishes to defend or cross appeal, the circuit court shall, where the defendant is indigent, appoint counsel to represent the defendant on appeal. The remuneration to be awarded appointed counsel shall be governed by ยง [19.2-326](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-326/).

In pretrial appeals, the defendant shall file a notice of cross appeal with the clerk of the circuit court within seven days following the notice of appeal filed by the Commonwealth.

Any brief on cross appeal shall be consolidated with the defendant's brief as appellee, if any.
