# § 22.1-288.2 Receipt, dissemination and maintenance of records of certain law-enforcement information.

A. A division superintendent shall disseminate the notice or information regarding an adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense listed in subsection G of § [16.1-260](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/), contained in a notice received by him pursuant to § [16.1-305.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-305.1/) to school personnel responsible for the management of student records and to other relevant school personnel, including, but not limited to, the principal of the school in which the student is enrolled. The principal shall further disseminate such information to licensed instructional personnel and other school personnel who (i) provide direct educational or support services to the student and (ii) have a legitimate educational interest in such information.

B. A parent, guardian or other person having control or charge of a student in a public school and, with consent of a parent or in compliance with a court order, the court in which the disposition was rendered, shall be notified in writing of any disciplinary action taken with regard to any incident upon which the adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense listed in subsection G of § [16.1-260](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/) was based and the reasons therefor. The parent or guardian shall also be notified of his or her right to review, and to request an amendment of, the student's scholastic record, in accordance with regulations of the Board of Education governing the management of scholastic records.

Every notice of adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense listed in subsection G of § [16.1-260](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/) received by a superintendent, and information contained in the notice, which is not a disciplinary record as defined in Board of Education regulations, shall be maintained by him and by any others to whom he disseminates it, separately from all other records concerning the student. However, if the school administrators or the school board takes disciplinary action against a student based upon an incident which formed the basis for the adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense listed in subsection G of § [16.1-260](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/), the notice shall become a part of the student's disciplinary record.

C. When a superintendent receives notice of the filing of a petition from the intake officer in accordance with § [16.1-260](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-260/), or upon request of a court services unit for information made in conjunction with the preparation of a social history report pursuant to § [16.1-273](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-273/), the superintendent shall provide information regarding the student's educational and attendance status to the intake officer or court services unit, as the case may be. Whenever a division superintendent receives notice of a student's commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice, the superintendent or his designee shall participate in the development of a reenrollment plan as provided in § [16.1-293](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-293/).
