# ยง 22.1-273.1 Annual screening for scoliosis.

Within the time periods specified in regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, each school board shall provide parent educational information or implement a program of regular screening for scoliosis for pupils in grades five through ten, unless such students are pupils admitted for the first time to a public school who have been so tested as part of the comprehensive physical examination required by ยง [22.1-270](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-270/) or the parents of such students have indicated their preference that their children not participate in such screening. Local school boards shall develop procedures for parents to indicate such preference.

The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations for the implementation of such screenings, which shall address, but shall not be limited to, requirements and training for school personnel and volunteers who may conduct such screenings; procedures for the notification of parents when evidence of scoliosis is detected; and such other provisions as the Board deems necessary. Local school divisions may seek volunteers from among professional health care providers.
