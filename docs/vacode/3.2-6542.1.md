# § 3.2-6542.1 Renewal of dangerous dog registration.

A. By January 31 of each year, until the animal is deceased, the owner of an animal found to be a dangerous dog pursuant to § [3.2-6540](/vacode/3.2-6540/) shall update and renew the dangerous dog registration certificate obtained pursuant to § [3.2-6540.01](/vacode/3.2-6540.01/) for a fee of $85 in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained. However, if the dangerous dog adjudication occurred within 60 days of the end of the calendar year, the first renewal shall be included in the initial registration at no additional charge to the owner.

B. Prior to the renewal date of a dangerous dog registration each year, a local animal control officer shall conduct an inspection of the dangerous dog and the premises on which it is kept, and no certificate of renewal shall be issued without such inspection. The animal control officer shall post registration information on the Virginia Dangerous Dog Registry established by § [3.2-6542](/vacode/3.2-6542/).

C. No dangerous dog registration certificate required to be obtained under this section shall be issued to any person who is younger than 18 years of age or who fails to present satisfactory evidence of (i) compliance with the provisions of §§ [3.2-6540](/vacode/3.2-6540/), [3.2-6540.01](/vacode/3.2-6540.01/), [3.2-6540.02](/vacode/3.2-6540.02/), [3.2-6540.03](/vacode/3.2-6540.03/), and [3.2-6540.04](/vacode/3.2-6540.04/); (ii) the animal's current rabies vaccination, if applicable; and (iii) a current county or city dog license, as appropriate.
