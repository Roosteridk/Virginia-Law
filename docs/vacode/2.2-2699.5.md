A. The Information Technology Advisory Council (ITAC) is established as an advisory council, within the meaning of § [2.2-2100](/vacode/2.2-2100/), in the executive branch of state government. The ITAC shall be responsible for advising, and making recommendations to, the Chief Information Officer of the Commonwealth (CIO) and the Secretary of Administration regarding information technology in the Commonwealth, as detailed in § [2.2-2699.6](/vacode/2.2-2699.6/).

B. The ITAC shall consist of not more than 20 members as follows: (i) the Secretary of Administration, or his designee, the CIO, and another of the Governor's Secretaries as defined in subsection E of § [2.2-200](/vacode/2.2-200/), or his designee, all of whom shall serve ex officio with voting privileges; (ii) four members of the House of Delegates, to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Delegates; (iii) three members of the Senate, to be appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules; and (iv) an even number, not to exceed 10, of nonlegislative citizen members to be appointed by the Governor and serve with voting privileges.

Legislative members and ex officio members of the ITAC shall serve terms coincident with their terms of office. Nonlegislative citizen members shall represent a diversity of appropriate experience and expertise and, after an initial staggering of terms, shall be appointed for terms of four years. Appointments to fill vacancies, other than by expiration of a term, shall be for the unexpired terms. All members may be reappointed. However, no nonlegislative citizen member shall serve more than two consecutive four-year terms. Initial appointment terms of one year or two years and the remainder of any term to which a member is appointed to fill a vacancy shall not constitute a term in determining the member's eligibility for reappointment. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments.

C. The ITAC shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman annually from among the members, except that neither the Secretary of Administration nor the CIO may serve as chairman. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum.

Funding for the costs of compensation and expenses of the members shall be provided by the Virginia Information Technologies Agency.
