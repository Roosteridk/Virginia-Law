# ยง 15.2-4910 Security for payment of bonds; default.

The principal of and interest on any bonds issued by the authority shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues and receipts out of which the same shall be made payable, and may be secured by a trust indenture covering all or any part of the authority facilities from which revenues or receipts so pledged may be derived, including any enlargements of and additions to any such projects thereafter made. The resolution under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any such trust indenture may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions thereof leased by the authority to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, all as the board of directors shall deem advisable not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement and trust indenture made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on such bonds have been fully paid. In the event of default in such payment or in any agreements of the authority made as a part of the contract under which the bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or in any trust indenture executed as security therefor, such payment or agreements may be enforced by writ of mandamus, or by a suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity to compel the authority and the directors, officers, agents or employees thereof to perform the terms, provisions, and covenants contained in any trust indenture of the authority, by the appointment of a receiver in equity or by foreclosure of any such trust indenture or any one or more of said remedies.
