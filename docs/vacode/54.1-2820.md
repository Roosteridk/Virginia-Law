8.

9. Discloses any penalties or restrictions, including but not limited to geographic restrictions or the inability of the provider to perform, on the delivery of merchandise, services or prearrangement guarantee; and

If the contract seller will not be furnishing the supplies and services to the purchaser, the contract seller must attach to the preneed funeral contract a copy of the seller's agreement with the provider.

B. Subject to the requirements of § [54.1-2822](/vacode/54.1-2822/), a preneed funeral contract may provide for an irrevocable trust or an amount in an irrevocable trust that is specifically identified as available exclusively for funeral or burial expenses, where:

1. A person irrevocably contracts for funeral goods and services, such person funds the contract by prepaying for the goods and services, and the funeral provider residing or doing business within the Commonwealth subsequently places the funds in a trust; or

2. A person establishes an irrevocable trust naming the funeral provider as the beneficiary; however, such person shall have the right to change the beneficiary to another funeral provider pursuant to § [54.1-2822](/vacode/54.1-2822/).

C. If a life insurance or annuity contract is used to fund the preneed funeral contract, the face amount of any life insurance policy issued to fund a preneed funeral contract shall not be deceased over the life of the life insurance policy except for life insurance policies that have lapsed due to nonpayment of premiums or have gone to a nonforfeiture option that lowers the face amount as allowed for in the provisions of the policy. The following must also be disclosed as prescribed by the Board:

1. The fact that a life insurance policy or annuity contract is involved or being used to fund the preneed contract;

2. The nature of the relationship among the soliciting agent, the provider of the supplies or services, the prearranger and the insurer;

3. The relationship of the life insurance policy or annuity contract to the funding of the preneed contract and the nature and existence of any guarantees relating to the preneed contract; and

4. The impact on the preneed contract of (i) any changes in the life insurance policy or annuity contract including but not limited to changes in the assignment, beneficiary designation or use of the proceeds, (ii) any penalties to be incurred by the policyholder as a result of failure to make premium payments, (iii) any penalties to be incurred or moneys to be received as a result of cancellation or surrender of the life insurance policy or annuity contract, and (iv) all relevant information concerning what occurs and whether any entitlements or obligations arise if there is a difference between the proceeds of the life insurance policy or annuity contract and the amount actually needed to fund the preneed contract.

D. When the consideration consists in whole or in part of any real estate, the contract shall be recorded as an attachment to the deed whereby such real estate is conveyed, and the deed shall be recorded in the clerk's office of the circuit court of the city or county in which the real estate being conveyed is located.

E. If any funeral supplies are sold and delivered prior to the death of the subject for whom they are provided, and the seller or any legal entity in which he or a member of his family has an interest thereafter stores these supplies, the risk of loss or damage shall be upon the seller during such period of storage.
