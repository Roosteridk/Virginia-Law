Pursuant to § [16.1-290](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-290/), responsible persons shall pay child support for a child placed in foster care from the date that custody was awarded to the local department. The court order shall state the names of the responsible persons obligated to pay support, and either specify the amount of the support obligation pursuant to §§ [20-108.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.1/) and [20-108.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.2/) or indicate that the Division of Child Support Enforcement will establish the amount of the support obligation. In fixing the amount of support, the court or the Division of Child Support Enforcement shall consider the extent to which the payment of support by the responsible person may affect the ability of such responsible person to implement a foster care plan developed pursuant to § [16.1-281](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-281/).
