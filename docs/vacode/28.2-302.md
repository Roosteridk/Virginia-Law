# ยง 28.2-302 Commercial fishing pier; license fee; penalty.

A. The owner of a commercial fishing pier shall pay an annual license fee of $50 or as subsequently revised by the Commission pursuant to ยง [28.2-201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-201/) for each pier that is over or upon the subaqueous beds of the Commonwealth.

B. Net fishing shall not be permitted within 300 yards of the sides or end of a commercial fishing pier. The Commission may decrease this distance if it considers 300 yards to be an excessive distance because of the size of the body of water where the pier is located. A violation of this subsection is a Class 3 misdemeanor.

C. The construction or erection of a commercial fishing pier on a subaqueous bed of the Commonwealth is subject to the permit requirements of ยง [28.2-1203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1203/).

D. For purposes of this section, a commercial fishing pier means any pier whose primary purpose is to allow fishing by the public for a fee. A public fishing pier operated by a political subdivision shall be considered to be a commercial fishing pier, although no fee is charged.
