# § 2.2-2205 Form, terms, execution and sale of bonds; use of proceeds; interim receipts or temporary bonds; lost or destroyed bonds; faith and credit of state and political subdivisions not pledged; expenses.

The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rates as are fixed by the Authority, or as may be determined in such manner as the Authority may provide, including the determination by agents designated by the Authority under guidelines established by the Authority, shall mature at such time not exceeding forty years from their date as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of bonds and their manner of execution, and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Authority or, if so authorized by the Authority, shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the Authority, or, if so authorized by the Authority, a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the Authority, or, if so authorized by the Authority, with the facsimile signature of such secretary or assistant secretary. Any coupons attached to bonds issued by the Authority shall bear the signature of the chairman or vice-chairman of the Authority or a facsimile thereof. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, his signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery and any bonds may bear the facsimile signature of, or may be signed by, such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be the proper officers to sign such bonds although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been such officers. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. Bonds issued in registered form may be issued under a system of book-entry for recording the ownership and transfer of ownership of rights to receive payment of principal of, and premium on, if any, and interest on such bonds. The Authority may contract for the services of one or more banks, trust companies, financial institutions or other entities or persons, within or without the Commonwealth for the authentication, registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the bonds, or may provide such services itself. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this article.

The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purposes, and in furtherance of the powers, of the Authority as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in a trust agreement authorized by § [2.2-2206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2206/) securing the bonds.

In addition to the above powers, the Authority may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds as provided in § [15.2-2616](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2616/) and execute and deliver new bonds in place of bonds mutilated, lost or destroyed, as provided in § [15.2-2621](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2621/).

No obligation of the Authority shall be deemed to constitute a debt, or pledge of the faith and credit, of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable solely from the revenues and other funds of the Authority pledged thereto. All such obligations shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that the Commonwealth, any political subdivision thereof and the Authority shall not be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues and other funds of the Authority pledged thereto, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such obligations.

All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the act shall be payable solely from funds provided under the provisions of this act, and no liability shall be incurred by the Authority beyond the extent to which moneys have been provided under the provisions of this article.
