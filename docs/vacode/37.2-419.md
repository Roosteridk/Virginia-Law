B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, following a proceeding as provided in § [2.2-4019](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4019/), the Commissioner may issue a special order for a violation of any of the provisions of § [37.2-400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-400/) or any regulation adopted under any provision of § [37.2-400](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-400/) or of this article that adversely affects the human rights of individuals receiving services or poses an imminent and substantial threat to the health, safety, or welfare of individuals receiving services.
