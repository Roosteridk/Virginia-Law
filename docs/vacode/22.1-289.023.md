# § 22.1-289.023 Enforcement and sanctions; special orders; civil penalties.

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, following a proceeding as provided in § [2.2-4019](/vacode/2.2-4019/), the Superintendent may issue a special order (i) for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, § [54.1-3408](/vacode/54.1-3408/), or any regulation adopted under any provision of this chapter which violation adversely affects, or is an imminent and substantial threat to, the health, safety, or welfare of the person cared for therein, or (ii) for permitting, aiding, or abetting the commission of any illegal act in a child day program or family day system. Notice of the Superintendent's intent to take any of the actions enumerated in subdivisions B 1 through 6 shall be provided by the Department, and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a prominent place at each public entrance of the licensed premises to advise consumers of serious or persistent violations. The issuance of a special order shall be considered a case decision as defined in § [2.2-4001](/vacode/2.2-4001/). Actions set forth in subsection B may be appealed by (a) a child day program or family day system operated by an agency of the Commonwealth in accordance with § [22.1-289.02](/vacode/22.1-289.02/)5 or (b) any other child day program or family day system in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.). The Superintendent shall not delegate his authority to impose civil penalties in conjunction with the issuance of special orders.

B. The Superintendent may take the following actions regarding child day programs and family day systems through the issuance of a special order and may require a copy of the special order provided by the Department to be posted in a prominent place at each public entrance of the licensed premises to advise consumers of serious or persistent violations:

1. Place a licensee on probation upon finding that the licensee is substantially out of compliance with the terms of its license and that the health and safety of children are at risk;

2. Reduce licensed capacity or prohibit new admissions when the Superintendent concludes that the licensee cannot make necessary corrections to achieve compliance with regulations except by a temporary restriction of its scope of service;

3. Mandate training for the licensee or licensee's employees, with any costs to be borne by the licensee, when the Superintendent concludes that the lack of such training has led directly to violations of regulations;

4. Assess civil penalties of not more than $500 per inspection upon finding that the child day program or family day system is substantially out of compliance with the terms of its license and the health and safety of children are at risk; however, no civil penalty shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision on any child day program or family day system operated by an agency of the Commonwealth;

5. Require licensees to contact parents, guardians, or other responsible persons in writing regarding health and safety violations; and

6. Prevent licensees who are substantially out of compliance with the licensure terms or in violation of the regulations from receiving public funds.

C. The Board shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
