# ยง 38.2-5012 Enforcement, etc., of orders and awards.

The Commission has full authority to enforce its orders and protect itself from deception. While the language of this section is permissive and provides that a party may enforce an award in court, it must be read and considered in pari materia with the Commission's power pursuant to ยง [65.2-202](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-202/) to punish for disobedience of its orders.

1987, c. 540.
