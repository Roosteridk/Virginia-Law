# ยง 20-176 Low-income parties; exception from imputed disqualification.

A. The disqualification provisions of ยง [20-175](/vacode/20-175/) apply to a collaborative lawyer representing a party with or without fee.

B. After a collaborative law process concludes, another lawyer in a law firm with which a collaborative lawyer disqualified pursuant to ยง [20-175](/vacode/20-175/) is associated may represent a party without fee in the collaborative matter or a matter related to such collaborative matter if:

1. The party has an annual income that qualifies the party for free legal representation under the criteria established by the law firm for free legal representation;

2. The collaborative law participation agreement so provides for such subsequent representation; and

3. The collaborative lawyer is isolated from any participation in the collaborative matter or a matter related to the collaborative matter through procedures within the law firm that are reasonably calculated to isolate the collaborative lawyer from such participation.
