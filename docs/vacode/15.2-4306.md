The following factors should be considered by the local planning commission and the advisory committee, and at any public hearing at which an application that has been filed pursuant to ยง [15.2-4303](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-4303/) is being considered:

1. The agricultural and forestal significance of land within the district or addition and in areas adjacent thereto;

2. The presence of any significant agricultural lands or significant forestal lands within the district and in areas adjacent thereto that are not now in active agricultural or forestal production;

3. The nature and extent of land uses other than active farming or forestry within the district and in areas adjacent thereto;

4. Local developmental patterns and needs;

5. The comprehensive plan and, if applicable, the zoning regulations;

6. The environmental benefits of retaining the lands in the district for agricultural and forestal uses; and
