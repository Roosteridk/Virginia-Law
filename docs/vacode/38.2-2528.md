# ยง 38.2-2528 Reinsurance.

Any mutual assessment property and casualty insurer may reinsure the whole or any part of its risks with any solvent insurer licensed in this Commonwealth or licensed or approved in any other state and meeting standards of solvency at least equal to those required in this Commonwealth if the reinsurance is ceded without contingent liability on the part of the reinsured insurer. Any mutual assessment property and casualty insurer having a surplus in excess of $800,000 may accept or assume reinsurance from any licensed property and casualty insurer. Any of those companies may accept or assume reinsurance on risks located within or without the territory in which it is authorized to transact insurance.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the participation of a mutual assessment property and casualty insurer in a pool or other plan among similar companies approved by the Commission for the purpose of spreading losses or providing reinsurance or catastrophe coverage for participants. The acceptance of reinsurance by any insurer outside the territory in which it is authorized to transact the business of insurance shall not be construed to enlarge its territory so as to affect any tax exemption to which it may be entitled.
