2.

3. Make every effort to collect each loan and comply with the Virginia Debt Collection Act (§ [2.2-4800](/vacode/2.2-4800/) et seq.) with regard to the collection of such loans, provided that, notwithstanding §§ [2.2-4805](/vacode/2.2-4805/) and [2.2-4806](/vacode/2.2-4806/), the institution may, with the consent of the borrower, modify the terms of any loan for which payments are past due to provide for repayment forbearance on such loan and repayment to commence on a mutually agreed-upon date in the future. Prior to entering into any such agreement, the institution shall provide the borrower with information regarding the effect of a forbearance on the loan amount, including (i) the amount of any additional accumulated principal and interest and (ii) the estimated total amount to be owed upon recommenced payments.
