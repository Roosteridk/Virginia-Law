# § 2.2-2818.2 Application of mandates to the state employee health insurance plan.

A. As used in this section, "insurance mandate" means a mandatory obligation with respect to coverage, benefits, or the number or types of providers imposed on policies of accident and health insurance under Title 38.2. "Insurance mandate" does not include (i) an administrative rule or regulation imposing a mandatory obligation with respect to coverage, benefits, or providers unless that mandatory obligation was specifically imposed on policies of accident and health insurance by statute or (ii) any obligation imposed on a health carrier by § [38.2-3407.5:2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3407.5:2/).

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [2.2-2818](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/), any law imposed under Title 38.2 that becomes effective on or after July 1, 2009, that provides for an insurance mandate for policies of accident and health insurance shall also apply to health coverage offered to state employees pursuant to § [2.2-2818](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/).

C. If health coverage offered to state employees under § [2.2-2818](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/) offers coverage in the same manner and to the same extent as the coverage required by an insurance mandate imposed under Title 38.2 or coverage that is greater than an insurance mandate imposed under Title 38.2, the coverage offered to state employees under § [2.2-2818](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/) shall be considered in compliance with the insurance mandate.
