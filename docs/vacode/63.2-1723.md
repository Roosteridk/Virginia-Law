A. Any person who seeks to operate or volunteer or work at a child welfare agency and who is disqualified because of a criminal conviction pursuant to §§ [63.2-1720](/vacode/63.2-1720/) and [63.2-1721](/vacode/63.2-1721/), may apply in writing for a waiver from the Commissioner.

The child welfare agency shall notify in writing every parent and guardian of the children in its care of any waiver granted for its operators, employees or volunteers.

B. The Board shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
