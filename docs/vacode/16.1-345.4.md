# § 16.1-345.4 Court review of mandatory outpatient treatment plan.

A. The juvenile and domestic relations district court judge shall hold a hearing within 15 days after receiving the motion for review of the mandatory outpatient treatment plan; however, if the fifteenth day is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day on which the court is lawfully closed, the hearing shall be held on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day on which the court is lawfully closed. If the minor is being detained under a temporary detention order, the hearing shall be scheduled within the same time frame provided for a commitment hearing under § [16.1-341](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-341/). The clerk shall provide notice of the hearing to the minor, his parents, the community services board, all treatment providers listed in the comprehensive mandatory outpatient treatment order, and the original petitioner for the minor's involuntary treatment. If the minor is not represented by counsel, the judge shall appoint an attorney to represent the minor in this hearing and any subsequent hearings under § [16.1-345.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.5/), giving consideration to appointing the attorney who represented the minor at the proceeding that resulted in the issuance of the mandatory outpatient treatment order. The judge shall also appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor. The community services board shall offer to arrange the minor's transportation to the hearing if the minor is not detained and has no other source of transportation.

B. If requested by the minor's parents, the community services board, a treatment provider listed in the comprehensive mandatory outpatient treatment plan, or the original petitioner for the minor's involuntary treatment, the juvenile and domestic relations district court judge may order an evaluation and appoint a qualified evaluator in accordance with § [16.1-342](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-342/) who shall personally examine the minor and certify to the court whether or not he has probable cause to believe that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary inpatient treatment or mandatory outpatient treatment as specified in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/) and subsection A of § [16.1-345.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.2/). The evaluator's report may be admitted into evidence without the appearance of the evaluator at the hearing if not objected to by the minor or his attorney. If the minor is not detained in an inpatient facility, the community services board shall arrange for the minor to be examined at a convenient location and time. The community services board shall offer to arrange for the minor's transportation to the examination, if the minor has no other source of transportation. If the minor refuses or fails to appear, the community services board shall notify the court, and the court shall issue a mandatory examination order and a civil show cause summons. The return date for the civil show cause summons shall be set on a date prior to the review hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection A, and the examination of the minor shall be conducted immediately after the hearing thereon, but in no event shall the period for the examination exceed eight hours.

C. If the minor fails to appear for the hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations district court judge shall, after consideration of any evidence from the minor, from his parents, from the community services board, or from any treatment provider identified in the mandatory outpatient treatment plan regarding why the minor failed to appear at the hearing, either (i) reschedule the hearing pursuant to subsection A, (ii) issue an emergency custody order pursuant to § [16.1-340](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340/), or (iii) issue a temporary detention order pursuant to § [16.1-340.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340.1/).

D. After hearing the evidence regarding the minor's material noncompliance with the mandatory outpatient treatment order and the minor's current condition, and any other relevant information referenced in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/) and subsection A of § [16.1-345.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.2/), the juvenile and domestic relations district court judge may make one of the following dispositions:

1. Upon finding by clear and convincing evidence that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary admission and treatment specified in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/), the judge shall order the minor's involuntary admission to a facility designated by the community services board for a period of treatment not to exceed 30 days;

2. Upon finding that the minor continues to meet the criteria for mandatory outpatient treatment specified in subsection A of § [16.1-345.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.2/), and that a continued period of mandatory outpatient treatment appears warranted, the judge may renew the order for mandatory outpatient treatment, making any necessary modifications that are acceptable to the community services board or treatment provider responsible for the minor's treatment. In determining the appropriateness of outpatient treatment, the court may consider the minor's material noncompliance with the previous mandatory treatment order; or

3. Upon finding that neither of the above dispositions is appropriate, the judge may rescind the order for mandatory outpatient treatment.

Upon entry of an order for involuntary inpatient admission, transportation shall be provided in accordance with § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/).

E. For the purposes of this section, "juvenile and domestic relations district court judge" shall not include a special justice as authorized by § [37.2-803](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-803/).
