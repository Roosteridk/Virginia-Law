The creation, alteration, or deletion of any computer data contained in any computer or computer network, which if done on a tangible document or instrument would constitute forgery under Article 1 (ยง [18.2-168](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-168/) et seq.) of Chapter 6 of this Title, will also be deemed to be forgery.
