# ยง 29.1-826 Installment sales.

A. Every retail installment sale shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing, which shall contain all the agreements of the parties, including a provision stating whether or not such sale is contingent upon financing on terms which are satisfactory to the parties and shall be signed by the buyer. The purchaser of an installment sales contract shall not be charged with notice of the agreement of the parties relative to financing upon the purchase of a retail installment sales contract signed by the borrower which states no such contingency.

B. Prior to or at the time of delivery of the watercraft the seller shall deliver to the buyer a written statement describing clearly the watercraft sold to the buyer. Whenever any charge for a summary of insurance coverage appears on such statement, and the insurance coverage effected or to be effected thereunder does not include a policy of watercraft liability insurance, the seller or his assignee shall stamp or mark upon the face of such writing in red letters no smaller than eighteen point type the following words: "No Liability Insurance Included." The Director may determine the form of such statement to be included therein. In the event that a policy of insurance of any kind is purchased at the time of the sale of a watercraft the seller shall deliver to the purchaser the policy of insurance, or a copy of the policy, within a reasonable time.
