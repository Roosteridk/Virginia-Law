| dn | 118 | ably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by this |
| do | 119 | Company all that remains of any property herein described, and |
| dp | 120 | submit to examinations under oath by any person named by this |
| dq | 121 | Company, and subscribe the same; and, as often as may be |
| dr | 122 | reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books of |
| ds | 123 | account, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies |
| dt | 124 | thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place as |

| dz | 130 | shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify |
| ea | 131 | the other of the appraiser selected within twenty days of such |
| eb | 132 | demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and dis- |
| ec | 133 | interested umpire; and failing for fifteen days to agree upon |
| ed | 134 | such umpire, then, on request of the insured or this Company, |
| ee | 135 | such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in |
| ef | 136 | the state in which the property covered is located. The ap- |
| eg | 137 | praisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual |
| eh | 138 | cash value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall |
| ei | 139 | submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writ- |
| ej | 140 | ing, so itemized, of any two when filed with this Company shall |
| ek | 141 | determine the amount of actual cash value and loss. Each |
| el | 142 | appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the ex- |
| em | 143 | penses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties |
| en | 144 | equally; provided, however, if the written demand is made by this |
| eo | 145 | Company, then the insured shall be reimbursed by this Company for |
| ep | 146 | the reasonable cost of the insured's appraiser and the insured's |
| eq | 147 | portion of the cost of the umpire. |
| er | 148 | **Company's** | It shall be optional with this Company to |
| es | 149 | **options.** | take all, or any part, of the property at the |
| et | 150 |   | agreed or appraised value, and also to re- |
| eu | 151 | pair, rebuild or replace the property destroyed or damaged with |
| ev | 152 | other of like kind and quality within a reasonable time, on giv- |
| ew | 153 | ing notice of its intention so to do within thirty days after the |
| ex | 154 | receipt of the proof of loss herein required. |
| ey | 155 | **Abandonment.** | There can be no abandonment to this Com- |
| ez | 156 |   | pany of any property. |
| fa | 157 | **When loss** | The amount of loss for which this Company |
| fb | 158 | **payable.** | may be liable shall be payable sixty days |
| fc | 159 |   | after proof of loss, as herein provided, is |
| fd | 160 | received by this Company and ascertainment of the loss is made |
| fe | 161 | either by agreement between the insured and this Company ex- |
| ff | 162 | pressed in writing or by the filing with this Company of an |
| fg | 163 | award as herein provided. |
| fh | 164 | **Suit.** | No suit or action on this policy for the recov- |
| fi | 165 |   | ery of any claim shall be sustainable in any |
| fj | 166 | court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy |
| fk | 167 | shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within |
| fl | 168 | two years next after inception of the loss. |
| fm | 169 | **Subrogation.** | This Company may require from the insured |
| fn | 170 |   | an assignment of all right of recovery against |
| fo | 171 | any party for loss to the extent that payment therefor is made |
| fp | 172 | by this Company. |
