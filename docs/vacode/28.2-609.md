If an assignment is not made within six months after the expiration of the notice, the application shall, upon the expiration of six months, lapse and become void, unless the Commissioner allows an extension. When a protest has been filed with the Commission against the granting of an application, the application shall not lapse until the Commission has finally acted upon the application.
