# § 51.1-1403 Health insurance credits for retired constitutional officers, employees of constitutional officers, general registrars, employees of general registrars, and local social service employees.

A. A local officer, as defined in § [51.1-124.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.3/), general registrar, employee of a general registrar, or an employee of a local social services board, retired under the Virginia Retirement System, including the hybrid retirement program described in § [51.1-169](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-169/), who rendered at least 15 years of total creditable service under the System shall receive a health insurance credit to his monthly retirement allowance, which shall be applied to reduce the retired member's health insurance premium cost. The amount of each monthly health insurance credit payable under this section shall be $1.50 for each full year of the retired member's creditable service, not to exceed a maximum monthly credit of $45; however, each former member whose retirement was for disability, a participant receiving long-term disability pursuant to § [51.1-1157](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1157/) or [51.1-1165](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1165/), or a member of the hybrid retirement program receiving long-term disability pursuant to coverage under subsection A of § [51.1-1153](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1153/) shall receive a monthly health insurance credit of $45. Eligibility for the credit shall be determined in a manner prescribed by the Virginia Retirement System. Any member who elects to defer his retirement pursuant to subsection C of § [51.1-153](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-153/) shall be entitled to receive the allowable credit provided by this section on the effective date of his retirement. The cost of such credit shall be borne by the Commonwealth.

B. In addition to the health insurance credit authorized in subsection A, localities which participate in the Virginia Retirement System may elect to provide an additional health insurance credit of $1 per month for each full year of the retired member's creditable service, not to exceed a maximum monthly credit of $30. The costs of such additional health insurance credit shall be borne by the locality.

C. 1. Those retired employees who purchase an alternative personal health insurance policy from a carrier or organization of their own choosing shall be eligible to receive a credit in the amount specified in subdivision C 2. Eligibility for the credit and payment of the credit shall be determined in a manner prescribed by the Virginia Retirement System.

2. The credit shall be in (i) the amount provided in subsection A, or subsection A and subsection B if the additional credit authorized by subsection B is provided or (ii) the amount of premium paid for the personal health insurance policy, whichever is less.

D. Any person included in the membership of a retirement system provided by Chapter 1 (§ [51.1-124.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/) et seq.), 2 (§ [51.1-200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-200/) et seq.), 2.1 (§ [51.1-211](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-211/) et seq.), or 3 (§ [51.1-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-300/) et seq.) who (i) rendered at least 15 years of total creditable service as a local officer as defined in § [51.1-124.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.3/) or as an employee of a local social services board or combined service as a general registrar or an employee of a general registrar and (ii) after terminating service as a local officer or employee of a local social services board or general registrar or as an employee of a general registrar, was employed by a local government that does not elect to provide a health insurance credit under § [51.1-1402](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1402/), shall be eligible for the credit provided by subsection A, provided that the retired employee is participating in a health insurance plan. The Commonwealth shall be charged with the credit as provided for in subsection A. In such case, the health insurance credit shall be determined based upon the amount of state service or service as a local officer or service as an employee of a local social services board or combined service as a general registrar or an employee of a general registrar, whichever is greater.

E. The Virginia Retirement System shall (i) actuarially determine the amount necessary to fund all credits provided under this section, (ii) reflect the cost of such credits in the applicable employer contribution rate pursuant to § [51.1-145](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-145/), and (iii) prescribe such terms and conditions as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
