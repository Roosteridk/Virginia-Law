A. It shall be unlawful for any agency to:

1. Require an individual to disclose or furnish his social security number not previously disclosed or furnished, for any purpose in connection with any activity, or to refuse any service, privilege, or right to an individual wholly or partly because the individual does not disclose or furnish such number, unless the disclosure or furnishing of such number is specifically required by state law in effect prior to January 1, 1975, or is specifically authorized or required by federal law;

2. Collect from an individual his social security number or any portion thereof unless the collection of such number is (i) authorized or required by state or federal law and (ii) essential for the performance of that agency's duties. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the collection of a social security number for the sole purpose of complying with the Virginia Debt Collection Act (§ [2.2-4800](/vacode/2.2-4800/) et seq.) or the Setoff Debt Collection Act (§ [58.1-520](/vacode/58.1-520/) et seq.);

4. Require any bidder, offeror, contractor, or grantee of an agency to provide the agency with personal donor information; or

5. Disclose personal donor information without the express, written permission of every individual who is identifiable from the potential release of such personal donor information, including individuals identifiable as members, supporters, or volunteers of, or donors to, the agency.

B. Agency-issued identification cards, student identification cards, or license certificates issued or replaced on or after July 1, 2003, shall not display an individual's entire social security number except as provided in § [46.2-703](/vacode/46.2-703/).

C. Any agency-issued identification card, student identification card, or license certificate that was issued prior to July 1, 2003, and that displays an individual's entire social security number shall be replaced no later than July 1, 2006, except that voter registration cards issued with a social security number and not previously replaced shall be replaced no later than the December 31st following the completion by the state and all localities of the decennial redistricting following the 2010 census. This subsection shall not apply to (i) driver's licenses and special identification cards issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Chapter 3 (§ [46.2-300](/vacode/46.2-300/) et seq.) of Title 46.2 and (ii) road tax registrations issued pursuant to § [46.2-703](/vacode/46.2-703/).

D. No agency, as defined in § [42.1-77](/vacode/42.1-77/), shall send or deliver or cause to be sent or delivered, any letter, envelope, or package that displays a social security number on the face of the mailing envelope or package or from which a social security number is visible, whether on the outside or inside of the mailing envelope or package.

E. The provisions of subsections A and C shall not be applicable to:

1. Any license issued by the State Corporation Commission's Bureau of Insurance until such time as a national insurance producer identification number has been created and implemented in all states. Commencing with the date of such implementation, the licenses issued by the State Corporation Commission's Bureau of Insurance shall be issued in compliance with subsection A. Further, all licenses issued prior to the date of such implementation shall be replaced no later than 12 months following the date of such implementation;

2. Any lawful warrant for personal donor information issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;

3. Any lawful request for discovery of personal donor information in litigation if (i) the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the personal donor information by clear and convincing evidence and (ii) the requester obtains a protective order barring disclosure of personal donor information to any person not directly involved in the litigation. As used in this subdivision, "person" means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, governmental entity, or other legal entity;

4. Any admission of relevant personal donor information as evidence before a court of competent jurisdiction; 

5. Any lawful investigation or enforcement action conducted pursuant to subsection C or D of § [57-59](/vacode/57-59/); or

6. Any form prescribed by the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council.

F. A person alleging a violation of this section may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief. A court rendering judgment in favor of a complainant pursuant to this subsection shall award all or a portion of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees and witness fees, to the complainant.

G. A person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to 90 days, a fine up to $1,000, or both.

H. Nothing in this section shall apply to the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act of 2006 (§ [24.2-945](/vacode/24.2-945/) et seq.).

I. As used in this section, "personal donor information" means names and data of any kind collected for the purpose of directly or indirectly identifying an individual as a member, supporter, or volunteer of, or donor of financial or nonfinancial support to, any entity exempt from federal income tax pursuant to § 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
