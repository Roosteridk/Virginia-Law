A. The award of the Commission, as provided in § [65.2-704](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-704/), if not reviewed in due time, or an award of the Commission upon such review, as provided in § [65.2-705](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-705/), shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact. No appeal shall be taken from the decision of one Commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full Commission, as provided in § [65.2-705](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-705/), and an award entered by it. Appeals shall lie from such award to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in the Rules of the Supreme Court.

In case of an appeal from the decision of the Commission to the Court of Appeals, or from the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, the appeal shall operate as a suspension of the award and no employer shall be required to make payment of the award involved in the appeal until the questions at issue therein shall have been fully determined in accordance with the provisions of this title.
