# ยง 15.2-816 Maintenance of certain sewer lines.

Upon petition of a majority of the affected property owners or members of an affected owners' association, (i) the county may take over the maintenance of undersized sewer lines installed as a result of the county's waiver of its adopted requirements developed under this title or Title 62.1; and (ii) the county shall be granted the right to convert the undersized sewer lines to county standards at its expense, if the county deems the conversion to be in its best interests for health or economic reasons; or (iii) if the property owners or their associations elect to convert the undersized sewer lines to county standards, the county may take over and maintain at county expense the converted sewer lines.

The cost for the maintenance of such lines shall be borne by the county general fund; or the county, at its discretion, may incorporate the sewer lines into an existing sanitary district for uniformity of maintenance and cost/budget allocations.

If the county determines that the builder/developer installed the undersized lines without the express permission of the appropriate county agency, then the county may collect the cost of conversion from the builder/developer; however, the county shall bear the ongoing cost of maintenance.

This section applies only to sewer lines installed on or before January 1, 1987.
