# ยง 15.2-916 Prohibiting shooting of compound bows, slingbows, arrowguns, crossbows, longbows, and recurve bows.

Any locality may prohibit the shooting of an arrow from a bow or arrowgun in a manner that can be reasonably expected to result in the impact of the arrow upon the property of another without permission from the owner or tenant of such property. For the purposes of this section, "bow" includes all compound bows, crossbows, slingbows, longbows, and recurve bows having a peak draw weight of 10 pounds or more. The term "bow" does not include bows that have a peak draw weight of less than 10 pounds or that are designed or intended to be used principally as toys. The term "arrow" means a shaft-like projectile intended to be shot from a bow.
