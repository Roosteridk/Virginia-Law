"National rating service" means Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Duff and Phelps, Inc., Fitch Investors Corporation, and any successor to the rating business of any of them.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law designating as legal investments for fiduciaries the bonds, notes, obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness issued by a governmental entity or political subdivision of the Commonwealth, including but not limited to agencies, authorities, commissions, districts, boards, or local governments, and except as specifically provided in § [2.2-4519](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4519/), fiduciaries, whether individual or corporate, shall, except as limited in subsection E, be conclusively presumed to have been prudent in investing the funds held by them in a fiduciary capacity in only the following securities:

1. Obligations of the Commonwealth, its agencies and political subdivisions. The following obligations:

a. Bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness of the Commonwealth and securities unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the Commonwealth;

b. Revenue bonds, revenue notes, or other evidences of revenue indebtedness issued by agencies or authorities of the Commonwealth upon which there is no default; and

c. Bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness of any county, city, town, district, authority, or other public body in the Commonwealth upon which there is no default provided that such bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness are (i) direct legal obligations of the public body, for the payment of which the public body has pledged its full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power, or (ii) unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the public body.

In every case referred to in this subdivision, such bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories of at least one national rating service and not rated in a category lower than the two highest rating categories of any national rating service. Determination of an obligation's rating in one of the two highest rating categories shall be made without regard to any refinement or gradation of such rating category by numerical or other modifier. In addition, the remaining maturity of such bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness shall not be greater than five years.

2. Obligations of the United States. Bonds, notes, and other obligations of the United States and securities unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the United States with a remaining maturity not greater than five years, except in the case of savings bonds, which may have a longer maturity. The obligations enumerated in this subdivision may be held directly or in the form of repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations or in the form of securities of any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, provided that the portfolio of such investment company or investment trust is limited to such obligations or repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations, or securities of other such investment companies or investment trusts whose portfolios are so restricted.

3. Savings accounts, time deposits, or certificates of deposit. Savings accounts, time deposits, or certificates of deposit in any bank, savings bank, trust company, savings and loan association, or credit union authorized to do business in the Commonwealth, but only to the extent that such accounts, deposits, or certificates are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any successor federal agency or by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or any successor to it.

C. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, investments listed in § [2.2-4519](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4519/) as in effect prior to July 1, 1992, which continue to be held on July 1, 1992, shall be subject to § [64.2-781](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-781/), and any reference to the Virginia "legal list" or to § [2.2-4519](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4519/) or any predecessor statute contained in a will, trust, or other instrument that was irrevocable on June 30, 1992, shall be construed to refer to such section as in effect on June 30, 1992, or at such earlier time as may be specified in the controlling document, absent an expression of intent to the contrary contained in such document.

D. The permissible investments specified in subsection B are not exclusive and shall not be construed to limit a fiduciary's investments as permitted pursuant to the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (§ [64.2-780](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-780/) et seq.).

E. The presumption under subsection B shall apply to (i) a fiduciary only for a calendar year in which the value of the intangible personal property under the fiduciary's control or management does not exceed $100,000 at the beginning of such year or (ii) a fiduciary who, on motion for good cause shown, has obtained express authorization from the court having jurisdiction over the fiduciary for the presumption under subsection B to apply.
