# § 51.1-502.1 Certain employees of teaching hospitals.

Any teaching hospital affiliated with an institution of higher education, other than the University of Virginia Medical Center, may purchase group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance policies covering in whole or in part its employees who are health care providers, as determined by the Department of Human Resource Management pursuant to § [2.2-2905](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2905/). In addition, any such teaching hospital may increase the coverage under such policies to make available to each active insured employee optional life, accidental death and dismemberment insurance as provided in § [51.1-512](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-512/). All health care providers employed by such teaching hospital on or after July 1, 1992, shall be covered by the policies purchased by the teaching hospital as soon as such policies become effective and may not elect to be covered by the Board's group insurance program under § [51.1-501](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-501/). Nor shall they be required to present at their own expense evidence of insurability satisfactory to an insurance company upon changing from one form of coverage to another provided by this chapter. No other section of this chapter shall apply to insurance coverage offered by a teaching hospital to which this section applies, except §§ [51.1-510](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/) and [51.1-511](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-511/).

Notwithstanding the definition of "state employee" contained in § [51.1-124.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.3/), a health care provider, as determined in accordance with subdivisions 18 and 19 of § [2.2-2905](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2905/), may be enrolled in a health care plan other than that provided for in § [2.2-2818](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2818/), at the election of a teaching hospital to which this section applies, and subject to the review and approval of the Secretary of Education.
