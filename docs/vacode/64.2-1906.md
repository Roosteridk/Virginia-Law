A. Subject to subsections B and C, a person not subject to § [64.2-1904](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1904/) or who holds property of or owes a liquidated debt to a minor not having a conservator may make an irrevocable transfer to a custodian for the benefit of the minor pursuant to § [64.2-1908](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1908/).

B. If a person having the right to do so under § [64.2-1902](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1902/) has nominated a custodian under that section to receive the custodial property, the transfer shall be made to that person.

C. If no custodian has been nominated under § [64.2-1902](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1902/), or all persons so nominated as custodian die before the transfer or are unable, decline, or are ineligible to serve, a transfer under this section may be made to an adult member of the minor's family or to a trust company unless the property exceeds $25,000 in value, in which event the transfer may be made if authorized by the court.
