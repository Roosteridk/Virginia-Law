# ยง 15.2-1901 Condemnation authority.

A. In addition to the authority granted to localities pursuant to any applicable charter provision or other provision of law, whenever a locality is authorized to acquire real or personal property or property interests for a public use, it may do so by exercise of the power of eminent domain, except as provided in subsection B.

B. A locality may acquire property or property interests outside its boundaries by exercise of the power of eminent domain only if such authority is expressly conferred by general law or special act. However, cities and towns shall have the right to acquire property outside their boundaries for the purposes set forth in ยง [15.2-2109](/vacode/15.2-2109/) by exercise of the power of eminent domain. The exercise of such condemnation authority by a city or town shall not be construed to exempt the municipality from the provisions of subsection F of ยง [56-580](/vacode/56-580/).

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, general or special, no locality shall condition or delay the timely consideration, advancement, or approval of any application for or grant of any permit or other approval for any real property over which it enjoys jurisdiction for the purpose, expressed or implied, of allowing the condemnation or acquisition of the property or to commence any process to consider whether to undertake condemnation or acquisition of the property.
