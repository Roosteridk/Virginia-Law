B. The restatement may include one or more amendments to the articles, including an amendment to delete the name and address of the initial registered agent or registered office, if a statement of change described in ยง [13.1-1221](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1221/) is on file with the Commission.
