The courts shall further take notice that the above table has been constructed, using scientific reasoning, to provide factfinders with an average baseline for motor vehicle stopping distances: (1) for a vehicle in good condition and (2) on a level, dry stretch of highway, free from loose material.

Deviations from these circumstances do not negate the usefulness of the table, but rather call for additional site-specific examination and/or explanation.

Site-specific research may be utilized under any circumstances.
