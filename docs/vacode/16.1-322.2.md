# ยง 16.1-322.2 Payment of funds quarterly; distribution and reallocation of reserve.

State moneys appropriated to the Department for the support of local juvenile secure detention facilities and apportioned in accordance with ยง [16.1-322.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-322.1/) shall be paid to localities or commissions quarterly. If a local juvenile secure detention facility fails to comply with Department policy or standards adopted by the State Board, the next quarterly payment may be reduced and the difference paid into the general fund of the state treasury. In effecting such a reduction of funds, the Department shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Chapter 40 (ยง [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.) of Title 2.2.

Any moneys distributed by the Commonwealth under this section which are unexpended at the end of each fiscal year within a biennium shall be retained by the locality or commission and subsequently expended for operating expenses of juvenile secure detention facilities. Any surplus funds remaining at the end of the biennium shall be returned to the state treasury.

The Governor may withhold approval for state expenditures, by reimbursement or otherwise, for the purpose set out in this section as provided in the current general appropriations act.
