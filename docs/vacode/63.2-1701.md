# § 63.2-1701 Licenses required; issuance, expiration, and renewal; maximum number of residents, participants or children; posting of licenses.

A. As used in this section, "person" means any individual; corporation; partnership; association; limited liability company; local government; state agency, including any department, institution, authority, instrumentality, board, or other administrative agency of the Commonwealth; or other legal or commercial entity that operates or maintains a child welfare agency, adult day care center, or assisted living facility.

B. Every person who constitutes, or who operates or maintains, an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency shall obtain the appropriate license from the Commissioner, which may be renewed. However, no license shall be required for an adult day care center that provides services only to individuals enrolled in a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly program operated in accordance with an agreement between the provider, the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Commissioner, upon request, shall consult with, advise, and assist any person interested in securing and maintaining any such license. Each application for a license shall be made to the Commissioner, in such form as he may prescribe. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is an association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the names and addresses of its officers and agents. The application shall also contain a description of the activities proposed to be engaged in and the facilities and services to be employed, together with other pertinent information as the Commissioner may require. In the case of an application for licensure as a children's residential facility, the application shall also contain information regarding any complaints, enforcement actions, or sanctions against a license to operate a children's residential facility held by the applicant in another state.

C. The licenses shall be issued on forms prescribed by the Commissioner. Any two or more licenses may be issued for concurrent operation of more than one assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency, but each license shall be issued upon a separate form. Each license and renewals thereof for an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency may be issued for periods of up to three successive years, unless sooner revoked or surrendered.

D. The length of each license or renewal thereof for an assisted living facility shall be based on the judgment of the Commissioner regarding the compliance history of the facility and the extent to which it meets or exceeds state licensing standards. On the basis of this judgment, the Commissioner may issue licenses or renewals thereof for periods of six months, one year, two years, or three years.

E. The Commissioner may extend or shorten the duration of licensure periods for a child welfare agency whenever, in his sole discretion, it is administratively necessary to redistribute the workload for greater efficiency in staff utilization.

F. Each license shall indicate the maximum number of persons who may be cared for in the assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency for which it is issued.

G. The license and any other documents required by the Commissioner shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.

H. Every person issued a license that has not been suspended or revoked shall renew such license prior to its expiration.

I. Officers, employees, or agents of the Commonwealth, or of any county, city, or town acting within the scope of their authority as such, who serve as or maintain a child-placing agency shall not be required to be licensed.
