# § 64.2-1426 Nonresident fiduciaries.

A. A natural person who is not a resident of the Commonwealth may be appointed or allowed to qualify or act as the personal representative, or trustee under a will, of any decedent, or appointed as the guardian of an infant's estate or the guardian or conservator of the property of an incapacitated person under Chapter 20 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ [64.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2100/) et seq.).

Qualification of such person as a personal representative, or trustee under a will, of any decedent shall be subject to the provisions of Article 1 (§ [64.2-500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-500/) et seq.) of Chapter 5.

At the time of qualification or appointment, each such nonresident shall file with the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the qualification is had or appointment is made his consent in writing that service of process in any action or proceeding against him as personal representative, trustee under a will, conservator, or guardian, or any other notice with respect to the administration of the estate, trust, or person in his charge in the Commonwealth may be by service upon the clerk of the court in which he is qualified or appointed, or upon such resident of the Commonwealth and at such address as the nonresident may appoint in the written instrument. In the event of the death, removal, resignation, or absence from the Commonwealth of a resident agent or any successor named by a similar instrument filed with the clerk, or if a resident agent or any such successor cannot with due diligence be found for service at the address designated in such instrument, then any process or notice may be served on the clerk of the circuit court. Notwithstanding §§ [64.2-505](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-505/) and [64.2-2011](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2011/), where any nonresident qualifies, other than as a guardian of an incapacitated person, pursuant to this subsection, bond with surety shall be required in every case, unless a resident personal representative, trustee, or fiduciary qualifies at the same time or the court or clerk making the appointment waives surety under the provisions of § [64.2-1411](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1411/).

B. A corporation shall not be appointed or allowed to qualify or act as personal representative, as trustee under a will, or as one of the personal representatives or trustees under a will of any decedent, or appointed or allowed to qualify or act as guardian of an infant, as one of the guardians of an infant, as guardian of the person or property of an incapacitated person under Chapter 20 (§ [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ [64.2-2100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2100/) et seq.), or as one of the guardians or conservators, unless the corporation is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the validity of any appointment or qualification made prior to January 1, 1962, nor to affect in any way the other provisions of this chapter or of § [64.2-609](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-609/). The provisions of this section shall not authorize or allow any appointment or qualification prohibited by § [6.2-803](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-803/).

C. The fact that an individual nominated or appointed as the guardian of the person of an infant is not a resident of the Commonwealth shall not prevent the qualification of the individual to serve as the sole guardian of the person of the infant.
