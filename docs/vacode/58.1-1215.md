When the affairs of any bank are being wound up under §§ [6.2-913](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-913/), [6.2-916](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-916/), and [6.2-1038](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1038/) or the comparable sections of the National Banking Act, such bank will not be subject to tax under this chapter, except as provided in this section. Returns of such assets on January 1 of each year shall be made by those having custody or control thereof. If any surplus remains after payment of all creditors and depositors, the liquidating officer shall ascertain the net capital of such bank, just prior to each year-end during the period of liquidation and cause to be paid an appropriate tax thereon before any distribution of any such surplus, but any such tax on the bank, even though paid late, shall not be subject to penalty.
