# § 16.1-340.3 Release of minor prior to commitment hearing for involuntary admission.

Prior to a hearing as authorized in § [16.1-341](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-341/), the judge may release the minor to his parent if it appears from all evidence readily available that the minor does not meet the commitment criteria specified in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/). The director of any facility in which the minor is detained may release the minor prior to a hearing as authorized in § [16.1-341](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-341/) if it appears, based on an evaluation conducted by the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist treating the minor, that the minor would not meet the commitment criteria specified in § [16.1-345](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345/) if released.
