# ยง 43-62 Lien for farm products consigned to commission merchant.

Whenever any farm products shall have been consigned to any commission merchant for sale, and he shall have made sale thereof and become insolvent or die before paying over the proceeds of the sale thereof to, or on account of, the consignor or owner of the farm products, the claim of such consignor or owner, when legally proved, shall be a lien on the estate of the commission merchant subject only to such liens as were created on the estate and recorded prior to his insolvency or death.

The benefit of this section shall not accrue to any consignor or owner who, without requesting payment, shall allow such proceeds to remain with such commission merchant at interest, nor to any consignor or owner who, without requesting payment, shall allow such proceeds to remain in the hands of such commission merchant more than 30 days after becoming informed of such sale.

Jurisdiction is hereby given to circuit courts to enforce the provisions of this section.
