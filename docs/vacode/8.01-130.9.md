# § 8.01-130.9 On what terms purchasers and lienors inferior to landlord may remove goods; certain liens not affected.

If, after the commencement of any tenancy, a lien is obtained or created by deed of trust, mortgage, or otherwise upon the interest or property in goods on premises leased or rented of any person liable for the rent, or such goods are sold, the party having such lien, or the purchaser of such goods, may remove them from the premises only on the following terms: On paying to the person entitled to the rent so much as is in arrear, and securing to him so much as to become due, what is so paid or secured not being more altogether than six months' rent if the premises are in a city or town, or in any subdivision of suburban and other lands divided into building lots for residential purposes, or of premises anywhere used for residential purposes, and not for farming or agriculture, and not being more altogether than 12 months' rent, if the lands or premises are used for farming or agriculture. If the goods are taken under legal process, the officer executing it shall, out of the proceeds of the goods, make such payment of what is in arrear, and as to what is to become due he shall sell a sufficient portion of the goods on a credit until then, taking from the purchasers bonds, with good security, payable to the person so entitled, and delivering such bonds to him. If the goods are not taken under legal process, such payment and security shall be made and given before their removal. Neither this section nor § [8.01-130.6](/vacode/8.01-130.6/) shall affect any lien for taxes, levies, or militia fines.

For the purpose of this section and § [8.01-130.6](/vacode/8.01-130.6/), a monthly or weekly tenancy shall not be construed as a new lease for every month or week of occupation of the premises by the tenant, but his tenancy shall be considered as a continuance of his original lease so long as he continues to occupy the property without making any new written lease.
