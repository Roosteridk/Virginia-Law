# § 63.2-1209 Entry of interlocutory order.

If, in the case of a direct parental placement adoption pursuant to § [63.2-1230](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1230/) or in circumstances in which an interlocutory order is necessary in an agency adoption, after considering the home study or any required report, the circuit court is satisfied that all of the applicable requirements have been complied with, that the petitioner is financially able to maintain adequately, except as provided in Chapter 13 (§ [63.2-1300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1300/) et seq.) of this title, and is morally suitable and a proper person to care for and train the child, that the child is suitable for adoption by the petitioner, and that the best interests of the child will be promoted by the adoption, it shall enter an interlocutory order of adoption declaring that henceforth, subject to the probationary period hereinafter provided for and to the provisions of the final order of adoption, the child will be, to all intents and purposes, the child of the petitioner. If the petition includes a prayer for a change of the child's name and the circuit court is satisfied that such change is in the best interests of the child, upon entry of final order, the name of the child shall be changed. An attested copy of every interlocutory order of adoption shall be forwarded forthwith by the clerk of the circuit court in which it was entered to the Commissioner and to the licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency or the local director that prepared the required home study or report. The agency or director shall, after receipt of the attested copy of the interlocutory order of adoption, prepare a report of visitation pursuant to § [63.2-1212](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1212/).

If the circuit court denies the petition for adoption and if it appears to the circuit court that the child is without proper care, custody or guardianship, the circuit court may, in its discretion, appoint a guardian for the child or commit the child to a custodial agency as provided for in §§ [16.1-278.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-278.2/), [16.1-278.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-278.3/) and [64.2-1703](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1703/), respectively.
