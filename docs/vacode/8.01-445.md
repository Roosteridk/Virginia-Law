# ยง 8.01-445 Distinction between term and vacation abolished; effect of time.

The distinction of what a court may do in term as opposed to vacation is hereby abolished. The period of time provided for the doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding is not affected or limited by the continued existence or expiration of a term of court. The continued existence or expiration of a term of court in no way affects the power of a court to do any act or take any proceeding in any civil action which has been pending before it.
