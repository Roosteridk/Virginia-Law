# ยง 4.1-112.2 Outdoor advertising; limitations; variances; compliance with Title 33.2.

A. No outdoor alcoholic beverage advertising shall be placed within 500 linear feet on the same side of the road, and parallel to such road, measured from the nearest edge of the sign face upon which the advertisement is placed to the nearest edge of a building or structure located on the real property of (i) a church, synagogue, mosque or other place of religious worship; (ii) a public, private, or parochial school or an institution of higher education; (iii) a public or private playground or similar recreational facility; or (iv) a dwelling used for residential use.

B. However, (i) if there is no building or structure on a playground or similar recreational facility, the measurement shall be from the nearest edge of the sign face upon which the advertisement is placed to the property line of such playground or similar recreational facility and (ii) if a public or private school providing grade K through 12 education is located across the road from a sign, the measurement shall be from the nearest edge of the sign face upon which the advertisement is placed to the nearest edge of a building or structure located on such real property across the road.

C. If, at the time the advertisement was displayed, the advertisement was more than 500 feet from (i) a church, synagogue, mosque or other place of religious worship; (ii) a public, private, or parochial school or an institution of higher education; (iii) a public or private playground or similar recreational facility; or (iv) a dwelling used for residential use, but the circumstances change such that the advertiser would otherwise be in violation of subsection A, the Board shall permit the advertisement to remain as displayed for the remainder of the term of any written advertising contract, but in no event more than one year from the date of the change in circumstances.

D. The Board may grant a permit authorizing a variance from the distance requirements of this section upon a finding that the placement of alcoholic beverage advertising on a sign will not unduly expose children to alcoholic beverage advertising.

E. Provided such signs are in compliance with local ordinances, the distance and zoning restrictions contained in this section shall not apply to:

1. Signs placed by licensees upon the property on which the licensed premises are located; or

2. Directional signs placed by manufacturers or wholesalers with advertising limited to trade names, brand names, the terms "distillery," "brewery," "farm winery," or "winery," and tour information.

F. The distance and zoning restrictions contained in this section shall not apply to any sign that is included in the Integrated Directional Sign Program administered by the Virginia Department of Transportation or its agents.

G. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize billboard signs containing outdoor alcoholic beverage advertising on property zoned agricultural or residential, or on any unzoned property. Nor shall this section be construed to authorize the erection of new billboard signs containing outdoor advertising that would be prohibited under state law or local ordinance.

H. All lawfully erected outdoor alcoholic beverage signs shall comply with the provisions of this subtitle, Board regulations, and Chapter 12 (ยง [33.2-1200](/vacode/33.2-1200/) et seq.) of Title 33.2 and regulations adopted pursuant thereto by the Commonwealth Transportation Board.
