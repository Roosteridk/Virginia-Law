# § 3.2-3706 Labeling.

A. Any liming material sold, offered or exposed for sale in the Commonwealth shall have affixed to the outside of each package in a conspicuous manner, a plainly printed, stamped or otherwise marked label, tag or statement, or in the case of bulk sales, a statement on the delivery slip, setting forth in the English language at least the following information:

1. The quantity statement of the liming material;

2. The brand or trade name of the liming material;

3. In the case of agricultural liming material, the identification of the type of the agricultural liming material as defined under § [3.2-3700](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-3700/), including the chemical analysis corresponding to the type definition;

4. The minimum percentage of available potash, if potash has been added to the liming material;

5. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the liming material as determined by procedures of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists in its most recent publication. Minimum calcium carbonate equivalents as prescribed by regulation;

6. The Effective Neutralizing Value of the liming material as calculated using the following formula:

(percent by weight passing 20 mesh sieves - percent by weight passing 60 mesh sieves) x 0.4 = (a)

(percent by weight passing 60 mesh sieves - percent by weight passing 100 mesh sieves) x 0.8 = (b)

(percent by weight passing 100 mesh sieves) x 1.0 = (c)

[(a+b+c) x Calcium Carbonate Equivalent (CCE)] divided by 100 = ENV;

7. The minimum percentage by weight passing through United States Standard sieves as prescribed by regulations; and

8. The name and principal office address of the manufacturer or distributor of the liming material.

B. For any fluid liming material or any packaged liming material-fertilizer mixture, the label shall also include the following information:

1. The kind of liming material used in the manufacture of the product;

2. The type of agricultural liming material used in the manufacture of the product, if applicable;

3. The guaranteed analysis of the final product; and

4. A statement setting forth the equivalency of the calcium carbonate equivalent of the fluid liming material or liming material-fertilizer mixture to the calcium carbonate equivalent of a standard liming ton.

C. For any bulk liming material-fertilizer mixture, except when the ingredients are billed separately, the label shall also include the following information:

1. The kind of liming material used in the manufacture of the product;

2. The type of agricultural liming material used in the manufacture of the product, if applicable;

3. The guaranteed analysis of the final product; and

4. A statement setting forth the equivalency of the calcium carbonate equivalent of the fluid liming material or liming material-fertilizer mixture to the calcium carbonate equivalent of a standard liming ton.

D. If the ingredients of the bulk liming material-fertilizer mixture are billed separately, the label shall also include the following information:

1. The kind of liming material used in the manufacture of the product;

2. The type of agricultural liming material used in the manufacture of the product, if applicable;

3. The dry weight of the liming material used in the manufacture of the product before mixing;

4. The guaranteed analysis of the liming material used in the manufacture of the product before mixing; and

5. The guaranteed analysis of the fertilizer used in the manufacture of the product before mixing.

E. For any industrial co-product used to neutralize soil acid, the product label shall include the statement "Industrial co-product used to neutralize soil acid." If the product is below the Virginia minimum standard requirements for an agricultural liming material as defined in the regulations, the statement "Substandard liming material" shall also be on the label.

F. All liming material shall be labeled as registered with the Commissioner.

G. No information or statement shall appear on any package, label, delivery slip or advertising matter that is false or misleading to the purchaser as to the quality, analysis, kind, type or composition of the liming material.

H. In the case of any liming material that has been adulterated subsequent to packaging, labeling or loading, and before delivery to the consumer, a plainly marked notice to that effect shall be affixed by the vendor to the package or delivery slip to identify the kind and degree of such adulteration.

I. The Board may require by regulation that the minimum percentage of calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate shall be expressed in the following form:

Total Calcium (Ca)..…%

Total Magnesium (Mg)..…%
