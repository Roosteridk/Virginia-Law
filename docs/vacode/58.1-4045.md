# ยง 58.1-4045 Liquidity pools.

The Board may promulgate rules authorizing permit holders to offset loss and manage risk, directly or with a third party approved by the Director, through the use of a liquidity pool in Virginia or another jurisdiction so long as such permit holder, or an affiliate of such permit holder, is licensed by such jurisdiction to operate a sports betting business. However, a permit holder's use of a liquidity pool shall not eliminate its duty to ensure that it has sufficient funds available to pay bettors.
