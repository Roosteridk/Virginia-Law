# ยง 23.1-600 Participation in and eligibility for state-supported financial aid programs.

A. Participation in and eligibility for state-supported financial aid or other higher education programs designed to promote greater racial diversity in public institutions of higher education shall not be restricted on the basis of race or ethnic origin. Any individual who is a member of any federally recognized minority is eligible for and may participate in such programs if such individual meets all other qualifications for admission to the relevant institution and the specific program.

B. Individuals who have completed a program of home instruction in accordance with ยง [22.1-254.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-254.1/) and individuals who have been excused from school attendance pursuant to subsection B of ยง [22.1-254](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-254/) shall be deemed to have met the high school graduation requirements for purposes of eligibility for any state-supported financial aid or other higher education programs. When a high school grade point average, class rank, or other academic criteria are specified as a condition of participating in a program, the Council shall develop empirical alternative equivalent measures that may be required for such programs.
