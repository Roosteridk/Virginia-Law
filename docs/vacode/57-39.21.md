# ยง 57-39.21 Duty to file declaration of land use restriction.

The owner of any land used or to be used as a pet cemetery shall file in the office of the clerk of the circuit court for the locality where the land is located a declaration restricting the use of the land to use as a pet cemetery. The owner shall execute the declaration in the same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in land. The clerk shall record the declaration in the deed book and index it in the name of the owner. The restriction established in such a recorded declaration may be removed only as provided in ยง [57-39.24](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-39.24/). Unless a restriction is so removed, no person shall use land restricted pursuant to this section for any purpose other than as a pet cemetery.
