# § 38.2-4010 Accumulation of reserve for an emergency fund.

A. In addition to provision for liability incurred on account of claims reported but not settled, claims incurred but not reported, and premiums, dues or assessments collected in advance, every company shall accumulate and maintain a reserve for an emergency fund, which in the preparation of financial statements shall be considered a liability of the corporation, of at least $10,000.

B. Each burial society shall, in each calendar year, add to that reserve for an emergency fund at least five percent of its net receipts from premiums, dues or assessments from policies of life insurance until the total accumulated reserve fund equals twenty percent of the total benefits provided in the outstanding certificates of life insurance. However, when the corporation has issued policies of life insurance on a legal reserve basis, the net receipts from those policies shall not be considered in the calculation of the reserve for an emergency fund, but the burial society shall be required to maintain only the reserve provided for in the certificates.
