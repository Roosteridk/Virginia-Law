1. Any business wishing to obtain these special license plates must (i) have a fleet of at least 100 vehicles registered in the Commonwealth, (ii) utilize one of the Department's online electronic fleet titling and registration systems to obtain title and registration documents for its vehicles, and (iii) enter into an agreement with the Department for the use of the business's logo.

2. Any business that enters into an agreement with the Department for the issuance of license plates under this section thereby waives any royalty fees to which it might otherwise be entitled for use of its logo.

3. Any initial request for license plates under this section shall be accompanied by an administrative fee as follows: (i) for 100-199 vehicles in a fleet, a fee of $4,500; (ii) for 200-349 vehicles in a fleet, a fee of $4,200; or (iii) for more than 349 vehicles in a fleet, a fee of $4,000.

4. For each set of license plates issued under this section without reserved numbers or letters, the Commissioner shall charge, in addition to the prescribed fee for state license plates, a one-time fee of $5. The fee for a replacement set of license plates issued under this section without reserved numbers or letters shall be $5.

5. For each set of license plates issued under this section with reserved letters or numbers as provided for in § [46.2-726](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-726/), in lieu of the fees prescribed by that section, the Commissioner shall charge, in addition to the prescribed fee for state license plates, a one-time fee of $15. The fee for a replacement set of license plates issued under this section with reserved numbers or letters shall be $15.

B. License plates may be issued under this section to vehicles of any type registered by the Department, including those registered under the International Registration Plan.
