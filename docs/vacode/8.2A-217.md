# ยง 8.2A-217 Identification.

Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs when:

(a) The lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified;

(b) The goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or

(c) The young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.
