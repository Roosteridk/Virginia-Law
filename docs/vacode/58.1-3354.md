# § 58.1-3354 Change when easement acquired.

In the case of any real estate upon which any easement has been acquired for the installation of public service, highway or street facilities, and which has not been reassessed by the commissioner of the revenue on request of the landowner as provided in § [58.1-3351](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3351/), the owner thereof may apply for relief to the circuit court of such county or any city court of record wherein such property is located. If the governing body of any county is of the opinion that any real estate therein is assessed at less than its fair market value, it shall direct the attorney for the Commonwealth to apply to the circuit court of such county to have the assessment corrected. Proceedings upon any such application shall be as provided in §§ [58.1-3984](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3984/) to [58.1-3989](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3989/) and the court shall enter such order with respect to the assessment as is just and proper.
