Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ [46.2-711](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-711/) and [46.2-712](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-712/) the Department may, in its discretion, issue a type of license plate suitable for permanent use on motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and motorcycles, together with decals, unless decals are not required under § [46.2-712](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-712/), to be attached to the license plates to indicate the registration period for which such vehicles have been properly licensed. The design of the license plates and decals, when required, shall be determined by the Commissioner.

Every permanent license plate and decal, when required, shall be returned to the Department whenever the owner of a vehicle disposes of it by sale or otherwise and when not actually in use on a motor vehicle, except dealer's plates temporarily not in use. The person in whose name the license plate is registered may apply, during the registration period for which it is issued, for the return thereof if the license plate is intended to be used on a subsequently acquired motor vehicle.

Every permanent license plate and decal, when issued, shall be returned to the Department whenever the owner of a vehicle elects to garage the vehicle and discontinue the use of it on the highway. The person in whose name the license plate is registered may apply, during the registration period for which it is issued, for the return thereof if the vehicle is to be returned to use on the highway.

For the purposes of this section, the term "motor vehicle" does not include a "moped" as defined in § [46.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-100/).
