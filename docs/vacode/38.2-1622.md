# § 38.2-1622 Use of safety fund, repayment, etc.

A. The purpose of the safety fund is to provide for the payment of covered claims in the event the assessment limit specified in subdivision A 3 of § [38.2-1606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1606/) is reached.

B. In the event the assets in the safety fund are needed to pay covered claims, these assets shall be loaned to the respective account specified in § [38.2-1604](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1604/). This loan shall be the general obligation of the Association.

C. Assets in the safety fund derived from borrowed moneys obtained under the provisions of subdivision B 7 of § [38.2-1606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1606/) shall be lent to an account at the rate of interest the Association is paying the lender providing such moneys. Interest on any other loan shall be compounded quarterly and be based upon the average ninety-day treasury bill rate for the most recently completed calendar quarter as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. This rate will be updated quarterly in order to conform with the market rates of interest.

D. Loans shall be repaid by levying assessments pursuant to subdivision A 3 of § [38.2-1606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1606/) against the members for the account on whose behalf the loan was negotiated. Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, the loan shall be repaid within six months of its issuance. This assessment in conjunction with any other assessments levied, shall not exceed the limit specified in subdivision A 3 of § [38.2-1606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1606/).

E. Subject to the approval of the Commission, assets in the safety fund may be loaned to any account specified in § [38.2-1604](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1604/) even though the maximum assessment in subdivision A 3 of § [38.2-1606](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1606/) has not been levied if the directors of the Association determine that this action will minimize the cost to the Association in paying covered claims.

F. Excess assets in the safety fund set forth in subsection D of § [38.2-1620](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1620/) may be used to pay the Association's covered claims without the members incurring a liability to repay the safety fund.
