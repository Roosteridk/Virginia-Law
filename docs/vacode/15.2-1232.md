# ยง 15.2-1232 Posting of bond not prerequisite to exercise of right by county.

Whenever the law requires the posting of a bond, with or without surety, as a condition precedent to the exercise of any right, a county, without giving such bond, may exercise such right, provided all other conditions precedent are complied with, and no action shall be delayed or refused because the county has not filed or executed the bond that might otherwise be required, and the county shall be bound to the same extent that it would have been bound had the bond been given.
