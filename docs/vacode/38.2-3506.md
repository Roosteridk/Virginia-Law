# § 38.2-3506 Order of certain policy provisions.

The provisions that are the subject of §§ [38.2-3503](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3503/) and [38.2-3504](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3504/), or any corresponding provisions that are used instead of them in accordance with these sections, shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such sections. However, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.
