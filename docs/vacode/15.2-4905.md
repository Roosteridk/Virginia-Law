If a locality has created an industrial development authority pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law, no other such authority, not created by such locality, shall finance facilities, except pollution control facilities, within the boundaries of such locality, unless the governing body of such locality in which the facilities are located or are proposed to be located, concurs with the inducement resolution adopted by the authority, and shows such concurrence in a duly adopted resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to invalidate or otherwise impair any existing financing by an authority or the financing of any facilities for which application has been made to an authority prior to July 1, 1981.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, general or special, nothing herein shall be deemed to impair the authority of the town council of the Town of Front Royal from creating its own independent industrial development authority, separate and apart for all purposes from any currently existing or future industrial development authority. A Town of Front Royal independent industrial development authority, created solely by the town, shall have all powers granted industrial development authorities generally as set forth in this chapter. Such industrial development authority may also include Warren County in any of its economic development projects for a period of five years ending July 1, 2025.
