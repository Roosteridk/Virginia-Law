# ยง 53.1-95.18 Design-build contracts.

An authority created pursuant to this article may enter into a contract for a jail on a fixed price or not-to-exceed price design-build basis or construction management basis in accordance with procedures consistent with those described in the Virginia Public Procurement Act (ยง [2.2-4300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4300/) et seq.) for procurement of nonprofessional services through competitive negotiation. The authority may authorize payment to no more than three responsive bidders who are not awarded the design-build contract if the authority determines that such payment is necessary to promote competition. The authority shall not be required to award a design-build contract to the lowest bidder but may consider price as one factor in evaluating the proposals received. The authority shall maintain adequate records to allow post-project evaluation by the Commonwealth.
