# ยง 59.1-506.11 Access contracts.

(a) If an access contract provides for access over a period of time, the following rules apply:

(1) The licensee's rights of access are to the information as modified and made commercially available by the licensor from time to time during that period.

(2) A change in the content of the information is a breach of contract only if the change conflicts with an express term of the agreement.

(3) Unless it is subject to a contractual use term, information obtained by the licensee is free of any use restriction other than a restriction resulting from the informational rights of another person or other law.

(4) Access must be available:

(A) at times and in a manner conforming to the express terms of the agreement; and

(B) to the extent not expressly stated in the agreement, at times and in a manner reasonable for the particular type of contract in light of the ordinary standards of the business, trade, or industry.

(b) In an access contract that gives the licensee a right of access at times substantially of its own choosing during agreed periods, an occasional failure to have access available during those times is not a breach of contract if it is:

(1) consistent with ordinary standards of the business, trade, or industry for the particular type of contract; or

(2) caused by:

(A) scheduled downtime;

(B) reasonable needs for maintenance;

(C) reasonable periods of failure of equipment, computer programs, or communications; or

(D) events reasonably beyond the licensor's control, and the licensor exercises such commercially reasonable efforts as the circumstances require.
