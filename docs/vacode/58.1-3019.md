# § 58.1-3019 Local tax credits for approved local volunteer activities.

A. For the purposes of this section:

"Approved volunteer services" means volunteer firefighting and fire prevention services, emergency medical and ambulance services, auxiliary police services, and emergency rescue services that operate exclusively for the benefit of the general public on behalf of nonprofit organizations or the locality. "Approved volunteer services" includes all training and training-related activities required by law to perform such approved volunteer services. "Approved volunteer services" includes only services performed by a bona fide volunteer.

"Bona fide volunteer" means an individual who performs approved volunteer services and whose only compensation for such performance is (i) reimbursement, or a reasonable allowance, for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of such approved volunteer services or (ii) reasonable benefits, including length of service awards, and fees for such approved volunteer services customarily paid by eligible employers in connection with the performance of approved volunteer services by bona fide volunteers.

B. The governing body of any county, city, or town may, by ordinance, provide a credit against taxes and fees imposed by the locality to an individual who provides approved volunteer services in the locality. The locality may allow the credit to be used against the individual's liability for any taxes, fees, or other charges imposed pursuant to Subtitle III (§ [58.1-3000](/vacode/58.1-3000/) et seq.), with the exception that the credits shall in no event be applicable to the property taxes, fees, or other charges imposed pursuant to Chapter 32 (§ [58.1-3200](/vacode/58.1-3200/) et seq.), 34 (§ [58.1-3400](/vacode/58.1-3400/) et seq.), or 35 (§ [58.1-3500](/vacode/58.1-3500/) et seq.). The locality may also allow the credit to be applied against any taxes, fees, or other charges imposed pursuant to Title 15.2. The locality, in its discretion, shall determine which taxes, fees, or other charges shall be allowable uses of the credit, and such information shall be stated in the ordinance.
