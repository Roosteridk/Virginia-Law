# ยง 9.1-173 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this article to enable any city, county or combination thereof to develop, establish, and maintain a local community-based probation services agency to provide the judicial system with sentencing alternatives for certain misdemeanants or persons convicted of felonies that are not felony acts of violence, as defined in ยง [19.2-297.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-297.1/) and sentenced pursuant to ยง [19.2-303.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-303.3/), for whom the court imposes a sentence of 12 months or less and who may require less than institutional custody.

The article shall be interpreted and construed so as to:

1. Allow individual cities, counties, or combinations thereof greater flexibility and involvement in responding to the problem of crime in their communities;

2. Provide more effective protection of society and to promote efficiency and economy in the delivery of correctional services;

3. Provide increased opportunities for offenders to make restitution to victims of crimes through financial reimbursement or community service;

4. Permit cities, counties or combinations thereof to operate and utilize local community-based probation services specifically designed to meet the rehabilitative needs of selected offenders; and

5. Provide appropriate post-sentencing alternatives in localities for certain offenders with the goal of reducing the incidence of repeat offenders.
