1. No later than 90 days after the final determination date, file a completed federal adjustments report, which shall include any information required by the Department;

2. No later than 90 days after a final determination date, notify the Department that it is making an elective payment; and

3. No later than one year after the final determination date, pay the elective payment amount specified in subsection B. Such amount shall be in lieu of taxes owed by the direct and indirect partners.

B. The elective payment amount shall be the amount of final federal adjustments, subject to the following modifications:

1. The elective payment amount shall exclude the distributive share of final federal adjustments that is reported to a direct exempt partner;

2. For the total distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments reported to (i) any direct corporate partner subject to tax under § [58.1-400](/vacode/58.1-400/) and (ii) any direct exempt partner subject to tax under § [58.1-400](/vacode/58.1-400/) on its unrelated business income or other taxable income, such adjustments shall be apportioned or allocated, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of §§ [58.1-405](/vacode/58.1-405/) through [58.1-423](/vacode/58.1-423/) and, after such apportionment or allocation, shall be multiplied by the tax rate specified in § [58.1-400](/vacode/58.1-400/) and, after such multiplication, shall be included in the elective payment;

3. For the total distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments reported to any nonresident direct partner that is subject to tax under Article 2 (§ [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) et seq.) or 6 (§ [58.1-360](/vacode/58.1-360/) et seq.), such adjustments shall be sourced to Virginia pursuant to applicable laws governing sourcing, and any adjustments sourced to Virginia shall be multiplied by the highest tax rate specified in § [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) and, after such multiplication, shall be included in the elective payment;

4. For the total distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments reported to any tiered partner, the elective payment shall include the amount specified in this subdivision.

However, the amount specified in clause (ii) shall exclude any amount that can be established, under guidelines issued by the Department, to be properly (a) allocable to a nonresident indirect partner, (b) allocable to a partner that is not subject to tax on such amount, or (c) excludable under procedures for alternative reporting and payment as specified in § [58.1-399.3](/vacode/58.1-399.3/). The amount specified in clauses (i) and (ii), as reduced by the exclusions specified in clauses (a), (b), and (c), shall be multiplied by the highest tax rate specified in § [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) or [58.1-360](/vacode/58.1-360/), as applicable, and, after such multiplication, shall be included in the elective payment;

5. For the total distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments reported to any resident direct partner that is subject to tax under § [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) or [58.1-360](/vacode/58.1-360/), such adjustments shall be multiplied by the highest tax rate specified in § [58.1-320](/vacode/58.1-320/) or [58.1-360](/vacode/58.1-360/), as applicable, and, after such multiplication, shall be included in the elective payment; and
