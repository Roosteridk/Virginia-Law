1. The report shall be filed on a "large dollar contribution report" form prescribed by the State Board and shall be filed in writing or electronically in the same manner as the person or committee files its quarterly disclosure reports.

2. Any contribution or loan reported pursuant to this section shall also be reported on the next subsequent report required under this article following receipt of the contribution or loan.

3. For the purposes of this section, referendum committees shall report as one contribution multiple contributions from a single source that have been subdivided into smaller amounts or given through different bank accounts for the purpose of evading the $10,000 threshold.

4. A referendum committee that receives contributions from affiliated organizations shall not be deemed to be receiving contributions from a single source.
