The Attorney General shall develop and publish on its website a list of individuals who are ineligible to be authorized holders as defined in ยง [58.1-1000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1000/).

D. No liability shall be imposed upon the Attorney General for any omissions or the incorrect inclusion of any individual on the listing required under subsection A. No liability shall be imposed upon any attorney for the Commonwealth or law-enforcement official who provides information to the Attorney General in accordance with subsection B. This provision shall not be construed to grant immunity for gross negligence or willful misconduct.
