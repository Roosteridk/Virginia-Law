The governing body of any county, city or town, if the town constitutes the school division, in which the school board has borrowed money from the Literary Fund shall include in its levies and appropriate to the school board a fund sufficient to meet the liabilities of the school board on such loan for the construction or renovation or enlarging of any school building, regardless of whether the title to the site is held by the school board, the local governing body or by a third party with whom the school board has entered into a long-term lease. The governing body of any county in which the school board thereof has borrowed money from the Literary Fund for construction of school facilities located in a town in such county constituting a separate school division shall have authority to include in its levies for such town, a levy sufficient to meet the liabilities of the school board on such loan and shall levy a separate tax in the rest of the county to meet its liabilities on any contract for school facilities constructed outside such town. In the event that such school board shall fail to pay any installment of interest or principal promptly, upon notice in writing to that effect from the State Treasurer, the county, city or town treasurer shall pay to the State Treasurer any such past-due installment of interest or principal, out of the funds in his hands belonging to such county, city or town. The failure of such governing body to provide for the payment of such loan or the interest thereon when and as due shall be deemed a cause for removal of the members thereof from office on motion before the circuit court having jurisdiction in such county, city or town, instituted by the attorney for the Commonwealth of such county or city or by the Attorney General where the attorney for the Commonwealth refuses or neglects to act after demand is made on him to proceed.
