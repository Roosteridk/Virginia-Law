B. Any person violating or failing, neglecting, or refusing to obey any lawful regulation or order of the Board or Commissioner or any provision of this title may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in an appropriate court by the Board or Commissioner to obey such regulation, order or provision of this title and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy or, pursuant to § [32.1-27.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-27.1/), imposition of a civil penalty or appointment of a receiver.

C. Without limiting the remedies which may be obtained in subsection B of this section, any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey any injunction, mandamus or other remedy obtained pursuant to subsection B shall be subject, in the discretion of the court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each violation, which shall be paid to the general fund, except that civil penalties for environmental pollution shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Water Supply Assistance Grant Fund created pursuant to § [32.1-171.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-171.2/). Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.

D. With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey any regulation or order of the Board or Commissioner or any provision of this title, the Board may provide, in an order issued by the Board against such person, for the payment of civil charges for past violations in specific sums, not to exceed the limits specified in § [32.1-27.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-27.1/) and subsection C of this section. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty which could be imposed under § [32.1-27.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-27.1/) and subsection C of this section. When civil charges are based upon environmental pollution, the civil charges shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Water Supply Assistance Grant Fund created pursuant to § [32.1-171.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-171.2/).
