# ยง 33.2-326 Control, supervision, and management of secondary state highway system components.

A. The control, supervision, management, and jurisdiction over the secondary state highway system shall be vested in the Department, and the maintenance and improvement, including construction and reconstruction, of such secondary state highway system shall be by the Commonwealth under the supervision of the Commissioner of Highways. The boards of supervisors or other governing bodies of the counties shall have no control, supervision, management, or jurisdiction over such public highways, causeways, bridges, landings, and wharves constituting the secondary state highway system. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the Board shall be vested with the same powers, control, and jurisdiction over the secondary state highway system in the counties and towns of the Commonwealth, and such additions as may be made, as were vested in the boards of supervisors or other governing bodies of the counties on June 21, 1932, and in addition thereto shall be vested with the same power, authority, and control as to the secondary state highway system as is vested in the Board in connection with the primary state highway system.

B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Department, when undertaking improvements to any secondary state highway system component or any portion of any such component, to fully reconstruct such component or portion thereof to bring it into compliance with all design and engineering standards that would be applicable to such component or portion thereof if the project involved new construction.
