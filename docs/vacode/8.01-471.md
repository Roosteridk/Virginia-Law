# ยง 8.01-471 Time period for issuing writs of eviction in unlawful entry and detainer; when returnable.

Writs of eviction, in case of unlawful entry and detainer, shall be issued within 180 days from the date of judgment for possession and shall be made returnable within 30 days from the date of issuing the writ. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a writ of eviction not executed within 30 days from the date of issuance shall be vacated as a matter of law without further order of the court that entered the order of possession, and no further action shall be taken by the clerk. No writ shall issue, however, in cases under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (ยง [55.1-1200](/vacode/55.1-1200/) et seq.) if, following the entry of judgment for possession, the landlord has entered into a new written rental agreement with the tenant, as described in ยง [55.1-1250](/vacode/55.1-1250/). A writ of eviction may be requested by the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney or agent.
