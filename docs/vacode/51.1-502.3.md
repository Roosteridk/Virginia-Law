All eligible employees of the Authority shall be covered by the policies purchased by the Authority as soon as such policies become effective and may not elect to be covered by the Board's group insurance program under § [51.1-501](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-501/), nor shall they be required to present at their own expense evidence of insurability satisfactory to an insurance company upon changing from one form of coverage to another provided by this chapter. No other section of this chapter shall apply to insurance coverage offered by the Authority to which this section applies except §§ [51.1-510](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/) and [51.1-511](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-511/).
