# § 6.2-1172 Accounts issued in name of minor.

A savings institution may issue accounts to a minor as sole and absolute owner of the account. With respect to any such account, a savings institution may (i) receive deposits by or for the minor owner, (ii) pay withdrawals, (iii) accept pledges to the association, and (iv) act in any other manner with respect to such accounts on the order of the minor owner. Any payment or delivery of funds from such account to its owner, or payment of a check or other written order for withdrawal signed by its minor owner, shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge of the institution for any payment or delivery so made. The parent or guardian of the minor owner shall not in his capacity as parent or guardian have the power to withdraw or transfer funds in any such account unless the minor has given written notice to the association to accept the signature of such parent or guardian.
