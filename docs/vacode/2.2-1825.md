After the allowance of any claim that is payable out of the state treasury, under any of the provisions of this title, a warrant shall be issued for the sum to be paid. A register of all warrants so issued shall be kept by the Comptroller, which register and a duplicate register shall, from time to time, be signed by the Comptroller or by such deputy he may designate for that purpose. The Comptroller shall not be required to sign the warrants.

All checks drawn upon warrants shown by the register and duplicate register, signed by the Comptroller or his deputy, shall be signed by the State Treasurer, or by such deputy as he may designate for that purpose. The signature may be made by means of a mechanical or electrical device selected by the State Treasurer.
