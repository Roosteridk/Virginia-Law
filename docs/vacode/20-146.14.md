# § 20-146.14 Jurisdiction to modify determination.

Except as otherwise provided in § [20-146.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-146.15/), a court of the Commonwealth may not modify a child custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of the Commonwealth has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under subdivision A 1 or A 2 of § [20-146.12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-146.12/) and:

1. The court of the other state determines that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under § [20-146.13](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-146.13/) or that a court of the Commonwealth would be a more convenient forum under § [20-146.18](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-146.18/); or

2. A court of the Commonwealth or a court of the other state determines that neither a parent of the child, nor the child, nor any person acting as a parent of the child presently resides in the other state.
