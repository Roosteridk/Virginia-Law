A. No officer or employee of a state agency shall use his public position to retaliate or threaten to retaliate against a person providing testimony before a committee or subcommittee of the General Assembly.

B. To be covered by the provisions of this section, a person who provides testimony before a committee or subcommittee of the General Assembly shall do so in good faith and upon a reasonable belief that the information is accurate.

D. Intentional violation of subsection A by an officer or employee of a state agency shall constitute malfeasance in office and shall subject the officer or employee responsible to suspension or removal from office, as may be provided by law in other cases of malfeasance.
