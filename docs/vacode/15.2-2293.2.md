# ยง 15.2-2293.2 Regulation of helicopter use.

No local zoning ordinance shall impose a total ban on departures and landings within the locality by non-commercial helicopters for personal use, but local zoning ordinances may require a special exception, special use permit, or conditional use permit for repetitive helicopter landings and departures on the same parcel of land in some or all zoning districts. Special exceptions or special use permits may be made subject to reasonable conditions for the protection or benefit of owners and occupants of neighboring parcels, including but not limited to conditions related to compliance with applicable regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration.
