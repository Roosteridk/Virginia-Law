The Authority is authorized to pledge to the bonds or notes of the Authority (i) authorized under the provisions of a resolution adopted subsequent to June 30, 2000, for the purpose described in § [22.1-166.2](/vacode/22.1-166.2/), (ii) issued subsequent to June 30, 2000, and (iii) not benefiting from the provisions of either clause (iii) or (iv) of § [22.1-168](/vacode/22.1-168/), or § [22.1-168.1](/vacode/22.1-168.1/), in addition to other sources available for such purpose, any funds in the general fund of the Commonwealth appropriated for such purpose.

B. The Governor's budget bill presented each year to the General Assembly pursuant to § [2.2-1509](/vacode/2.2-1509/) shall include an appropriation to the Authority of a sum sufficient from the general fund of the Commonwealth to cure any shortfall in pledged primary revenues on any debt service payment date on the bonds or notes of the Authority described by this section. A shortfall in pledged primary revenues shall exist when the available moneys in the Literary Fund as of such date are less than the amount required to pay the debt service due on such bonds or notes on such date. For purposes of this subsection "available moneys in the Literary Fund" means moneys remaining after the payment, or provision for payment, of debt service on bonds or notes like those described in this section and payable from the Literary Fund, but issued prior to July 1, 2000.

C. On or before September 30 of each year, the Authority shall submit to the Governor and the chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations a report as of the end of the prior fiscal year detailing the total amount of the Authority's outstanding bonds and notes secured by an appropriation of a sum sufficient from the general fund of the Commonwealth as described in subsection B. The report shall also describe any instances where any such appropriation has been used.
