# § 24.2-653 Provisional voting; procedures in polling place.

A. Any person voting provisionally pursuant to subsection B of § [24.2-643](/vacode/24.2-643/), § [24.2-651.1](/vacode/24.2-651.1/), subsection B of § [24.2-652](/vacode/24.2-652/), or § [24.2-653.1](/vacode/24.2-653.1/) or [24.2-653.2](/vacode/24.2-653.2/) shall be given a printed ballot and provide, subject to the penalties for making false statements pursuant to § [24.2-1016](/vacode/24.2-1016/), on a green envelope supplied by the Department of Elections, the identifying information required on the envelope, including the last four digits of his social security number, if any, full name including the maiden or any other prior legal name, date of birth, complete address, and signature. Such person shall be asked to present one of the forms of identification specified in subsection B of § [24.2-643](/vacode/24.2-643/). If he is unable to present one of these forms of identification, he shall sign a statement, subject to felony penalties for false statements pursuant to § [24.2-1016](/vacode/24.2-1016/), that he is the named registered voter he claims to be. The officers of election shall note on the green envelope whether or not the voter has presented one of the specified forms of identification or signed the required statement in lieu of presenting one of the specified forms of identification. The officers of election shall enter the appropriate information for the person in the precinct provisional ballots log in accordance with the instructions of the State Board but shall not enter a consecutive number for the voter on the pollbook nor otherwise mark his name as having voted.

The voter shall then, in the presence of an officer of election, but in a secret manner, mark the printed ballot as provided in § [24.2-644](/vacode/24.2-644/) and seal it in the green envelope. The envelope containing the ballot shall then promptly be placed in the ballot container by an officer of election.

B. An officer of election, by a written notice given to the voter, shall inform him that a determination of his right to vote shall be made by the electoral board and advise the voter of the beginning time and place for the board's meeting and of the voter's right to be present at that meeting. If the voter is voting provisionally as required by § [24.2-643](/vacode/24.2-643/), an officer of election, by written notice given to the voter, shall also inform him that he may submit a copy of one of the forms of identification specified in subsection B of § [24.2-643](/vacode/24.2-643/) or a statement, signed by him subject to felony penalties for false statements pursuant to § [24.2-1016](/vacode/24.2-1016/), that he is the named registered voter he claims to be to the electoral board by facsimile, electronic mail, in-person submission, or timely United States Postal Service or commercial mail delivery, to be received by the electoral board no later than noon on the third day after the election.

C. The provisional votes submitted pursuant to subsection A, in their unopened envelopes, shall be sealed in a special envelope marked "Provisional Votes," inscribed with the number of envelopes contained therein, and signed by the officers of election who counted them. All provisional votes envelopes shall be delivered either (i) to the clerk of the circuit court who shall deliver all such envelopes to the secretary of the electoral board or (ii) to the general registrar in localities in which the electoral board has directed delivery of election materials to the general registrar pursuant to § [24.2-668](/vacode/24.2-668/).
