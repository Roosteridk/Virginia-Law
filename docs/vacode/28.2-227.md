# § 28.2-227 Special nonresident harvester's license; fee and oath; revocation; penalty.

A. Any nonresident desiring to take or catch marine fish, crabs or any other seafood, except oysters, clams or other mollusks, from the tidal waters of the Commonwealth for which a license is required shall pay to any officer or agent a fee for a nonresident harvester's license. The fee, to be established by the Commission, shall be no less than $350 or more than $1,150 or as subsequently revised by the Commission pursuant to § [28.2-201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-201/). Three hundred fifty dollars of each fee shall be credited to the Virginia Marine Products Fund as provided under § [3.2-2705](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-2705/). The remainder of the fee shall be credited to the Marine Fishing Improvement Fund, as established pursuant to § [28.2-208](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-208/).

B. The license shall be required of each boat used in Virginia's tidal waters and shall be in addition to any other licenses required for the activity involved.

D. A nonresident harvester's license shall be required prior to the purchase of any other license for the harvesting of seafood. Revocation of this license in accordance with § [28.2-232](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-232/) shall constitute revocation of any other license held by the nonresident under the provisions of this subtitle. No commercial fishing license or permit shall be sold to a nonresident whose state of residence does not offer for sale the same or substantially similar license or permit to a resident of the Commonwealth.

E. Any Virginia resident who enters into a partnership or other agreement with the intent to defeat the object of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
