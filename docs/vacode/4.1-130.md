# § 4.1-130 Importation of beverages not under customs or internal revenue bonds; storage in approved warehouses; release.

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [4.1-311](/vacode/4.1-311/), alcoholic beverages not under United States customs bonds or internal revenue bonds may be transported into and stored in the Commonwealth in warehouses which have been approved by the Board for that purpose.

The Board may refuse to approve any warehouse as a place where alcoholic beverages may be stored if it has reasonable cause to believe that the owner or operator of the warehouse is a person to whom or the place sought to be approved is one for which the Board may refuse to grant a license under the provisions of § [4.1-222](/vacode/4.1-222/), which shall apply mutatis mutandis, unless the provisions of such section are inapplicable.

The Board may disapprove any warehouse which has been approved as a place where alcoholic beverages may be stored if it has reasonable cause to believe that a ground exists for which the Board may suspend or revoke a license under the provisions of § [4.1-225](/vacode/4.1-225/), which shall apply mutatis mutandis, unless the provisions of such section are inapplicable.

B. Alcoholic beverages stored in warehouses in the Commonwealth pursuant to this section shall be released only on permits issued by the Board for delivery to the Board or to persons entitled to receive them within or outside the Commonwealth.
