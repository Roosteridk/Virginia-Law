# § 32.1-137.14 Reconsideration of adverse determination.

A. A treating provider may request reconsideration of an adverse determination pursuant to this section or may appeal an adverse determination pursuant to § [32.1-137.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.15/). Any reconsideration of an adverse determination shall only be requested by the treating provider on behalf of the covered person. A determination on reconsideration shall be made by a physician advisor, peer of the treating health care provider, or a panel of other appropriate health care providers with at least one physician advisor or peer of the treating health care provider on the panel.

B. The treating provider on behalf of the covered person shall be (i) notified verbally at the time of the determination of the reconsideration of the adverse determination and in writing following the determination of the reconsideration of the adverse determination, in accordance with § [32.1-137.9](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.9/), including the criteria used and the clinical reason for the adverse determination and the alternate length of treatment of the alternate treatment setting or settings, if any, that the entity deems to be appropriate, and (ii) notified verbally at the time of the determination of the reconsideration of the adverse determination of the process for an appeal of the determination pursuant to § [32.1-137.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.15/) and the contact name, address, and telephone number to file and perfect an appeal. If the treating provider on behalf of the covered person requests that the adverse determination be reviewed by a peer of the treating provider at any time during the reconsideration process, the request for reconsideration shall be vacated and considered an appeal pursuant to § [32.1-137.15](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-137.15/). In such cases, the covered person shall be notified that the reconsideration has been vacated and an appeal initiated, all documentation and information provided or relied upon during the reconsideration process pursuant to this section shall be converted to the appeal process, and no additional actions shall be required of the treating provider to perfect the appeal.

C. Any reconsideration shall be rendered and the determination provided to the treating provider and the covered person in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the request for reconsideration.
