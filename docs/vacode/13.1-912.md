# ยง 13.1-912 Articles of termination of corporate existence.

A. When a corporation has distributed all of its assets and voluntary dissolution proceedings have not been revoked, it shall file articles of termination of corporate existence with the Commission. The articles shall set forth:

1. The name of the corporation;

2. That all the assets of the corporation have been distributed; and

3. That the dissolution of the corporation has not been revoked.

B. If the Commission finds that the articles of termination of corporate existence comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall by order issue a certificate of termination of corporate existence. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the existence of the corporation shall cease, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings and appropriate corporate action by members, directors and officers as provided in this Act.

C. The statement "that all the assets of the corporation have been distributed" means that the corporation has divested itself of all its assets by the payment of claims or by assignment to a trustee or trustees as directed by ยง [13.1-907](/vacode/13.1-907/). If any certificate holder, member, bondholder, or other security holder, or a participating patron of a cooperative who is entitled to a share in the distribution of the assets cannot be found, the corporation may thereupon, and without awaiting the one year mentioned in ยง [55.1-2513](/vacode/55.1-2513/), pay such person's share to the State Treasurer as abandoned property on complying with all applicable requirements of ยง [55.1-2524](/vacode/55.1-2524/) except subdivision B 4 of that section.
