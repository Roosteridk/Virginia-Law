# ยง 15.2-3514 Courts and judicial circuits.

Until changed by law, the same judicial circuits shall continue, though this may result in the consolidated county or city being a part of two or more circuits. All such courts shall, however, be held at the place designated as the seat of the consolidated county or administrative offices of the city, and each such court shall continue to have and exercise the same jurisdiction as it had and exercised before such consolidation. If two or more judges have jurisdiction in any consolidated county or city, they or a majority of them shall exercise the power to appoint officers and fill vacancies as is vested in judges of circuit courts of other counties and cities.
