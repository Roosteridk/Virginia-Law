# § 50-73.52:7 Reinstatement of a limited partnership that has ceased to exist.

A. A limited partnership that has ceased to exist may apply to the Commission for reinstatement within five years thereafter, unless the cancellation was by order of the Commission (i) entered pursuant to subdivision A 1 of § [50-73.52:6](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.52:6/) or (ii) entered pursuant to § [50-73.50](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.50/) and the circuit court's decree directing dissolution contains no provision for reinstatement of the existence of the limited partnership.

B. To have the certificate of limited partnership reinstated, a limited partnership shall provide the Commission with the following:

1. An application for reinstatement signed by a general partner of the limited partnership or, if there are no general partners, a limited partner, which may be in the form of a letter;

2. A reinstatement fee of $100;

3. All annual registration fees required by § [50-73.67](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.67/) and penalties that were due before the certificate of limited partnership was canceled and that would have been assessed or imposed to the date of reinstatement if the limited partnership's certificate of limited partnership had not been canceled;

4. If the name of the limited partnership does not comply with the provisions of § [50-73.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.2/) at the time of reinstatement, an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership to change the limited partnership's name to a name that satisfies the provisions of § [50-73.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.2/), with the fee required by this chapter for the filing of an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership; and

5. If the limited partnership's registered agent has filed a statement of resignation and a new registered agent has not been appointed, a statement of change pursuant to § [50-73.5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.5/).

C. If the limited partnership complies with the provisions of this section, the Commission shall enter an order of reinstatement of existence. Upon entry of the order, the existence of the limited partnership shall be deemed to have continued from the date of the cancellation as if cancellation had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the limited partnership or a partner or other agent after the cancellation and before the reinstatement is determined as if cancellation of the limited partnership's existence had never occurred.
