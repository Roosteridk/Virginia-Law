# ยง 10.1-1616 Exemption from taxes or assessments.

The exercise of the powers granted by this chapter is for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions. Since the operation and maintenance of projects by the Authority and the undertaking of activities in furtherance of the purpose of the Authority will constitute the performance of essential governmental functions, the Authority shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any project or any property acquired or used by the Authority under the provisions of this chapter or upon the income therefrom, including sales and use taxes on tangible personal property used in the operations of the Authority. Any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income which may result, including any profit made on the sale, shall be free from state and local taxation. The exemption hereby granted shall not be construed to extend to persons conducting business on the premises of a facility for which local or state taxes would otherwise be required.
