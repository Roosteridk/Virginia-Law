# ยง 13.1-1281 Court-ordered inspection.

A. If a business trust does not allow a beneficial owner who complies with subsection A of ยง [13.1-1279](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1279/) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the circuit court in the city or county where the business trust's principal office is located, or, if none in this Commonwealth, where its registered office is located, may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the business trust's expense upon application of the beneficial owner.

B. If a business trust does not within a reasonable time allow a beneficial owner to inspect and copy any other record, the beneficial owner who complies with subsections B and C of ยง [13.1-1269](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1269/) may apply to the circuit court in the city or county where the business trust's principal office is located, or, if none in this Commonwealth, where its registered office is located, for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.

C. If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may also order the business trust to pay the beneficial owner's costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred to obtain the order if the beneficial owner proves that the business trust refused inspection without a reasonable basis of doubt about the right of the beneficial owner to inspect the records demanded.

D. If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding beneficial owner.
