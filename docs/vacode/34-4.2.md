# § 34-4.2 Additional exemption for parents of dependent children.

A. Where a parent supports a dependent minor child or children residing with him, that parent can hold exempt from wage garnishment, in addition to the property or estate that he is entitled to hold exempt from creditor process under §§ [20-108.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.1/), [34-4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-4/), [34-4.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-4.1/), [34-26](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-26/), [34-27](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-27/), [34-29](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/), and [64.2-311](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-311/), an additional amount for the support of the child or children as follows: $34 per week for one child; $52 per week for two children; and $66 per week for three or more children. This additional wage exemption amount shall not be available to a parent whose household gross income, including any support payments for children living in the home, exceeds $1,750 per month. For purposes of this section, "household gross income" means all income from all sources, and shall include, but not be limited to, salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains, social security benefits, workers' compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, veterans' benefits, child support, spousal support, rental income, gifts, prizes or awards paid to any adult living in the household or to the dependent child.

To claim this wage exemption, the parent shall attach to the claim for exemption form set forth in § [8.01-512.4](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-512.4/) an affidavit and two items of proof showing that the debtor is entitled to this additional wage exemption.
