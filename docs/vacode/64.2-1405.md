# ยง 64.2-1405 Court may appoint trustee in place of one named in will, deed, or other writing; management by corporate trustee outside of the Commonwealth.

A. If a trustee named in a will, deed, or other writing (i) dies, (ii) becomes incapable of executing the trust on account of physical or mental disability or confinement in prison, (iii) if residency is statutorily required, is no longer a resident of the Commonwealth, (iv) declines to accept the trust, (v) resigns the trust after having accepted the trust, (vi) in the case of a corporate trustee, is adjudicated bankrupt or for any reason loses its charter, (vii) for any other reason ceases to be eligible to continue serving as trustee, or (viii) for any other good cause shown, the circuit court in which such will was admitted to probate or such deed or other writing is or might have been recorded, or if the trustee is a corporation, in which its principal office in the Commonwealth is located, or in which the trustee resides, may on motion of any interested party, and upon satisfactory evidence of any of the conditions in clauses (i) through (viii), appoint a trustee in place of the trustee named in the instrument.

B. The circuit court may appoint a substitute corporate trustee whenever a corporate trustee removes the management function over an existing trust which was previously managed in the Commonwealth to a jurisdiction outside of the Commonwealth if the court finds that the management of the trust after such removal results in good cause for the substitution of the trustee. A corporate trustee that maintains a place of business in the Commonwealth where one or more trust officers are available on a regular basis for personal contact with trust customers or beneficiaries shall not be deemed to have removed such management function.
