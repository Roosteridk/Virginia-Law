# ยง 13.1-891 Effect of amendment of articles of incorporation.

An amendment to the articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing in favor of or against the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than members of the corporation. An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name.
