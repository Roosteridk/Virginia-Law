# § 15.2-2640 Resolution for bond issue; contents; request for bonds for school purposes.

Whenever the governing body of any county determines that it is advisable to contract a debt and issue general obligation bonds of the county, it shall adopt an ordinance or resolution setting forth in brief and general terms the purpose or purposes for which the bonds are to be issued and the maximum amount of the bonds to be issued.

Where voter approval is required or permitted by the Constitution of Virginia or this chapter, the ordinance or resolution shall request the circuit court to order an election to be held pursuant to §§ [15.2-2610](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2610/) and [15.2-2611](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2611/) on the question of contracting the debt and issuing the proposed bonds.

Before the adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the governing body of any county requesting the ordering of an election on the question of contracting a debt and issuing bonds for school purposes, or, if no referendum is required, adopting an ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds for school purposes, the school board of the county must first request, by resolution, the governing body of the county to take such action.

If voter approval is not required by the Constitution of Virginia or the provisions of this chapter, the governing body of the county has all the powers granted by this chapter to the governing bodies of municipalities with respect to incurring debt and issuing bonds.
