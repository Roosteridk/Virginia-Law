# § 3.2-5401 Adulterated livestock product or poultry product.

Any livestock product or poultry product shall be deemed to be adulterated:

1. If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance, such article shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in or on such article does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;

2. If it bears or contains (by reason of administration of any substance to the livestock or poultry or otherwise) any added poisonous or added deleterious substance (other than one that is: (i) a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity; (ii) a food additive; or (iii) a color additive) that may, in the judgment of the Commissioner, make such article unfit for human food;

3. If it is, in whole or in part, a raw agricultural commodity and such commodity bears or contains a pesticide chemical that is unsafe within the meaning of § 346a of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

4. If it bears or contains any food additive that is unsafe within the meaning of § 348 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

5. If it bears or contains any color additive that is unsafe within the meaning of § 379e of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; provided, that an article that is not otherwise deemed adulterated under subsection C or D of this section shall nevertheless be deemed adulterated if use of the pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive in or on such article is prohibited by regulations of the Board in official establishments;

6. If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food;

7. If it has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health;

8. If it is, in whole or in part, the product of an animal (including poultry) that has died otherwise than by slaughter;

9. If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render the contents injurious to health;

10. If it has been intentionally subjected to radiation, unless the use of the radiation was in conformity with a regulation or exemption in effect pursuant to § 348 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

11. If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom; or if any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part therefor; or if damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear better or of greater value than it is; or

12. If it is margarine containing animal fat and any of the raw material used therein consisted in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance.
