# ยง 15.2-5431.37 Provisions of chapter cumulative; construction.

Neither this chapter nor anything herein contained shall be construed as a restriction or limitation upon any powers which an authority or governmental unit acting under the provisions of this chapter might otherwise have under any laws of the Commonwealth, but shall be construed as cumulative of any such powers. This chapter shall be construed as complete and independent authority for the performance of each and every act and thing authorized by this chapter. No proceedings, notice or approval shall be required for the organization of an authority or the issuance of any bonds or any instrument as security therefor, except as herein provided, any other law to the contrary notwithstanding. However, nothing herein shall be construed to deprive the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions of their respective police powers over properties of an authority or to impair any power thereover of any official or agency of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions that may be otherwise provided by law. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to authorize an authority to occupy or use any land, streets, buildings, structures or other property of any kind, owned or used by any political subdivision within its jurisdiction, or any public improvement or facility maintained by such political subdivision for the use of its inhabitants, without first obtaining the consent of the governing body thereof.
