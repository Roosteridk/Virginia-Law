# ยง 33.2-261 Value engineering required in certain projects.

For the purposes of this section, "value engineering" means a systematic process of review and analysis of an engineering project by a team of persons not originally involved in the project. Such team may offer suggestions that would improve project quality and reduce total project cost, ranging from a combination or elimination of inefficient or expensive parts or steps in the original proposal to total redesign of the project using different technologies, materials, or methods.

The Department shall employ value engineering in conjunction with any project that has an estimated construction cost of more than $15 million on any highway system using criteria established by the Department.

After a review, the Commissioner of Highways may waive the requirements of this section for any project for compelling reasons. Any such waiver shall be in writing, state the reasons for the waiver, and apply only to a single project.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to projects that are designed (i) utilizing a design-build contract pursuant to ยง [33.2-209](/vacode/33.2-209/) or [33.2-269](/vacode/33.2-269/) or (ii) pursuant to the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995 (ยง [33.2-1800](/vacode/33.2-1800/) et seq.).
