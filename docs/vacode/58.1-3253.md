# § 58.1-3253 Biennial general reassessments; annual or biennial assessment.

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the governing body of any county or city having at least one full-time real estate appraiser or assessor qualified by the Tax Commissioner may provide by ordinance for the biennial assessment and equalization of real estate in lieu of the reassessments required under this chapter. Any county or city employing such method shall conduct a new reassessment of all real property biennially, but may complete such reassessment during an entire two-year period, employing the same standards of value for all appraisals made during such period.

B. In lieu of the method now prescribed by law, the governing body of any county or city may, by ordinance duly adopted, provide for the annual assessment and equalization of real estate for local taxation, or the biennial assessment as authorized by subsection A. If so made, all real estate shall thereafter be assessed as of January 1 of each year, except as provided in Chapter 30 of this subtitle.
