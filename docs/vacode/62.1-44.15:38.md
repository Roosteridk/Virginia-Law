# § 62.1-44.15:38 (For repeal date, see Acts 2016, cc. 68 and 758, as amended by Acts 2017, c. 345) Department to review VSMPs.

A. The Department shall develop and implement a review and evaluation schedule so that the effectiveness of each VSMP authority, Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System Management Program, and other MS4 permit requirements is evaluated no less than every five years. The review shall include an assessment of the extent to which the program has reduced nonpoint source pollution and mitigated the detrimental effects of localized flooding. Such reviews shall be coordinated with those being implemented in accordance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Law (§ [62.1-44.15:51](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:51/) et seq.) and associated regulations and, where applicable, the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (§ [62.1-44.15:67](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:67/) et seq.) and associated regulations.

B. Following completion of a compliance review of a VSMP, the Department shall provide results and compliance recommendations to the Board in the form of a corrective action agreement if deficiencies are found; otherwise, the Board may find the program compliant. If, after such a review and evaluation, a VSMP is found to have a program that does not comply with the provisions of this article or regulations adopted thereunder, the Board shall establish a schedule for the VSMP authority to come into compliance. The Board shall provide a copy of its decision to the VSMP authority that specifies the deficiencies, actions needed to be taken, and the approved compliance schedule. If the VSMP has not implemented the necessary compliance actions identified by the Board within 30 days following receipt of the corrective action agreement, or such additional period as is granted to complete the implementation of the corrective action, then the Board shall have the authority to (i) issue a special order to any VSMP imposing a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 per day with the maximum amount not to exceed $20,000 per violation for noncompliance with the requirements of this article and its regulations, to be paid into the state treasury and deposited in the Virginia Stormwater Management Fund established by § [62.1-44.15:29](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:29/) or (ii) revoke its approval of the VSMP. The Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.) shall govern the activities and proceedings of the Board under this article and the judicial review thereof.

If the Board revokes its approval of a VSMP, the Board shall find the VSMP authority provisional and shall have the Department assist with the administration of the program until the VSMP authority is deemed compliant with the requirements of this article and associated regulations. Assisting with administration includes the ability to review and comment on plans to the VSMP authority, to conduct inspections with the VSMP authority, and to conduct enforcement in accordance with this article and associated regulations.

In lieu of issuing a special order or revoking the program, the Board may take legal action against a VSMP pursuant to § [62.1-44.15:48](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.15:48/) to ensure compliance.
