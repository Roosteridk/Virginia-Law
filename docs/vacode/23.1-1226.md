# ยง 23.1-1226 Powers; issuance of negotiable notes.

The Authority may issue negotiable notes for any corporate purpose or renew any notes by the issuance of new notes, whether or not the notes to be renewed have matured. The Authority may issue notes partly to renew notes or to discharge other obligations then outstanding and partly for any other purpose. Such notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. Any resolution authorizing notes or any issuance of notes by the Authority may contain any provision that the Authority may include in any resolution authorizing revenue bonds or any issuance of revenue bonds by the Authority, and the Authority may include in any note any term, covenant, or condition that it may include in any bond. All such notes are payable solely from the revenues of the Authority, subject only to any contractual rights of the holders of any of its notes or other obligations then outstanding.
