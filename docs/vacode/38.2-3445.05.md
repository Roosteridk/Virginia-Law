A. If the Commission has cause to believe that any health care provider has engaged in a pattern of potential violations of § [38.2-3445.01](/vacode/38.2-3445.01/) with no corrective action, the Commission may submit information to the Board of Medicine or the Commissioner of Health for action. Prior to such submission, the Commission may provide the provider with an opportunity to cure the alleged violations or provide an explanation as to why the actions in question were not violations of § [38.2-3445.01](/vacode/38.2-3445.01/).
