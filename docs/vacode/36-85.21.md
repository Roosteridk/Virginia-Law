# ยง 36-85.21 Notice and hearing.

The Board shall not suspend, revoke, or deny a license or refuse the renewal of a license, or impose a civil penalty, until a written notice of the complaint has been furnished to the regulant or applicant against whom the same is directed, and a hearing thereon has been held before the Board. Reasonable written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the regulant or applicant by certified mail to his last known address, as shown on the license or other record of information in possession of the Board. At any such hearing, the regulant or applicant shall have the right to be heard in person or through counsel. After the hearing, the Board shall have the power to deny, suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the license in question for violation of the provisions of this chapter. Immediate notice of any such action by the Board shall be given to the regulant or applicant in the same manner as provided herein for furnishing notice of hearing.

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this section and the Administrative Process Act (ยง [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.), the provisions of the Administrative Process Act shall govern.
