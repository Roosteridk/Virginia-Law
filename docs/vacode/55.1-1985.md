# ยง 55.1-1985 Investigations and proceedings.

A. Whenever the Common Interest Community Board receives a written complaint that appears to state a valid claim, the Common Interest Community Board shall make necessary public or private investigations in accordance with law within or outside of the Commonwealth to determine whether any declarant or its agents, employees, or other representatives have violated or are about to violate this chapter or any Common Interest Community Board regulation or order, or to aid in the enforcement of this chapter or in the prescribing of Common Interest Community Board regulations and forms. The Common Interest Community Board may also in like manner and with like authority investigate written complaints against persons other than the declarant or its agents, employees, or other representatives.

B. For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this chapter, the Common Interest Community Board or any officer designated by regulation may administer oaths or affirmations and upon its own motion or upon request of any party shall subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter that is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence.

C. Upon failure to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the investigating officer and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected by such failure, the Common Interest Community Board may apply to the Circuit Court of the County of Henrico for an order compelling compliance.
