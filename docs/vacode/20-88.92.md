1. A complete text of the foreign support agreement; and

2. A record stating that the foreign support agreement is enforceable as an order of support in the issuing country.

C. A tribunal of the Commonwealth may vacate the registration of a foreign support agreement only if, acting on its own motion, the tribunal finds that recognition and enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with public policy.

2. The agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;

3. The agreement is incompatible with a support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose in the Commonwealth, another state, or a foreign country if the support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in the Commonwealth; or

4. The record submitted under subsection B lacks authenticity or integrity.

E. A proceeding for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement must be suspended during the pendency of a challenge to or appeal of the agreement before a tribunal of another state or a foreign country.
