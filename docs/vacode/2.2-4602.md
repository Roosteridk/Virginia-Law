The Treasury Board or its designee shall invest moneys in the local government investment pool with the degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. Specifically, the types of authorized investments for local government investment pool assets shall be limited to those set forth for local officials in Chapter 45 (ยง [2.2-4500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4500/) et seq.) of this title.

G. Except as provided in this section, all instruments of title of all investments of the local government investment pool shall remain in the custody of the State Treasurer.
