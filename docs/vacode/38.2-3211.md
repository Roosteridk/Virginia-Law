# § 38.2-3211 Same; other factors in calculations.

A. Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under any life insurance policy issued on or after the operative date stated in § [38.2-3214](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3214/) in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in §§ [38.2-3203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3203/) through [38.2-3209](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3209/) may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall at least equal the amounts used to provide these additions.

B. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [38.2-3203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3203/), additional benefits payable in the following cases and premiums for them shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by §§ [38.2-3202](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3202/) through [38.2-3216](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3216/):

a. Death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;

b. Total and permanent disability;

c. Reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;

d. Term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;

e. Term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and

f. Other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits.

2. No additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.
