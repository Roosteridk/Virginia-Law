# ยง 63.2-1608 Involuntary adult protective services.

A. If an adult lacks the capacity to consent to receive adult protective services, these services may be ordered by a court on an involuntary basis through an emergency order pursuant to ยง [63.2-1609](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1609/) or by a guardian or conservator appointed pursuant to Chapter 20 (ยง [64.2-2000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-2000/) et seq.) of Title 64.2.

B. In ordering involuntary adult protective services, the court shall authorize only that intervention which it finds to be least restrictive of the adult's liberty and rights, while consistent with his welfare and safety. The basis for such finding shall be stated in the record by the court.

C. The adult shall not be required to pay for involuntary adult protective services, unless such payment is authorized by the court upon a showing that the person is financially able to pay. In such event the court shall provide for reimbursement of the actual costs incurred by the local department in providing adult protective services, excluding administrative costs.
