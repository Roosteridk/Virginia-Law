# ยง 13.1-641 Fractional shares.

A. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a corporation may, if authorized by its board of directors, issue fractions of a share or in lieu of doing so may:

1. Pay in cash the value of fractions of a share;

2 Issue scrip in registered or bearer form entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough scrip to equal a full share; or

3. Arrange for disposition of fractional shares held by the shareholders.

B. Each certificate representing scrip shall be conspicuously labeled "Scrip" and shall contain the applicable information required by subsection B of ยง [13.1-647](/vacode/13.1-647/).

C. The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights of a shareholder, including the rights to vote and to receive distributions, including distributions upon dissolution. The holder of scrip is not entitled to any rights of a shareholder unless the scrip provides for them.

D. The board of directors may authorize the issuance of scrip subject to any condition, including that:

1. The scrip will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date; and

2. The shares for which the scrip is exchangeable may be sold by the corporation and the proceeds paid to the scrip holders.

E. When a corporation is to pay in cash the value of fractions of a share such value shall be determined by the board of directors. A good faith judgment of the board of directors as to the value of a fractional share is conclusive.
