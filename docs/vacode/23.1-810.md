# ยง 23.1-810 Authorization for campus police departments in private institutions of higher education.

The governing board of each private institution of higher education may establish, in compliance with the provisions of this article, a campus police department and employ campus police officers upon appointment as provided in ยง [23.1-812](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-812/). Except as such provisions apply exclusively to public institutions of higher education or employees, the provisions of this article shall apply to the appointment and employment of officers and the operation, powers, duties, and jurisdiction of campus police departments at private institutions of higher education, and such departments are subject to and shall enjoy the benefits of this article. However, to be qualified to use the word "police" to describe the department or its officers, any private institution of higher education that establishes a campus police department shall require each officer to comply with the training or other requirements for law-enforcement officers established by the Department of Criminal Justice Services pursuant to Chapter 1 (ยง [9.1-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-100/) et seq.) of Title 9.1.
