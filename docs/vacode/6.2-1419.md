# § 6.2-1419 Cease and desist orders.

If the Commission determines that any association has violated any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the Commission may, upon 21 days' notice in writing, order the association to cease and desist from such practices and to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The notice shall be sent by certified mail to the principal place of business of the association and shall state the grounds for the contemplated action. Within 14 days of mailing the notice, the association may file with the clerk of the Commission a written request for a hearing. If a hearing is so requested, the Commission shall not issue a cease and desist order prior to such hearing. The Commission may enforce compliance with any such order by imposition and collection of such fines and penalties as may be prescribed by Commission regulations, or by revocation of the association's authority to do business in accordance with §§ [6.2-1418](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1418/) and [6.2-1420](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1420/).
