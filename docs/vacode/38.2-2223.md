# § 38.2-2223 Variations of, or additions to, form.

For the word "company" appearing in any standard form, there may be substituted a more accurate descriptive term for the type of insurer. Additional provisions, other than those in the standard form, or coverages more favorable than those in the standard form, may be used with a standard form by any insurer with the approval of the Commission. However, the Commission shall first determine that the more favorable coverage or the additional provisions are not in conflict or inconsistent with the standard form, the laws of this Commonwealth or any rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
