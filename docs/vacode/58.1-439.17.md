# § 58.1-439.17 Grants in lieu of or in addition to tax credits.

The Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission created under § [3.2-3101](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-3101/) may establish a grant program for purposes of encouraging qualified investments and eligible research and development activities in tobacco-dependent localities. If the Commission elects to establish such a program, the program may be in addition to the tax credit programs allowed under former §§ [58.1-439.13](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.13/) and [58.1-439.14](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.14/). The criteria to receive grants shall be the same as the criteria for the tax credits allowed under former §§ [58.1-439.13](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.13/) and [58.1-439.14](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.14/) as they were in effect on December 31, 2009. In any case where a grant is awarded for any investment or for eligible research and development activity, the person receiving the grant may not use such investment or research and development activity as the basis for claiming any credit provided under the Code of Virginia.
