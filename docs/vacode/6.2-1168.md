# ยง 6.2-1168 Redemption.

At any time that funds are on hand for the purpose, a mutual savings institution shall have the right to redeem by lot or otherwise, as the board of directors may determine, all or any part of any of its savings accounts on an earnings date by giving 30 days' notice by certified mail addressed to each affected account holder at his last address as recorded on the books of the institution. No mutual savings institution shall redeem any of its savings accounts when its liabilities exceed its assets or when it has applications for withdrawal that have been on file more than 30 days and have not been reached for payment. The redemption price of savings accounts redeemed shall be the full value of the account redeemed, as determined by the board of directors, but in no event shall the redemption price be less than the withdrawal value. If the notice of redemption has been duly given, and if on or before the redemption date the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside to be, and continue to be, available therefor, interest upon the accounts called for redemption shall cease to accrue from and after the date specified as the redemption date. All rights with respect to such accounts shall terminate upon the redemption date, other than any right of the account holder of record to receive the redemption price without interest. Accounts called for redemption, if unclaimed, shall be subject to the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (ยง [55.1-2500](/vacode/55.1-2500/) et seq.).
