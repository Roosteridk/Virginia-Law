# § 15.2-3548 Effect on town charter.

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any town located within or partially within a county proposing to consolidate with another county or city, or combination thereof, into a consolidated county and which is not a party to the consolidation agreement, shall continue as a town in the consolidated county.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, in the event a proposed consolidation of a county with another county or city into a consolidated city is approved by the voters as provided in § [15.2-3540](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3540/), any town located within or partially within a county and not a party to the consolidation agreement shall continue as a township. The charter of such town shall become the charter of the township. Such townships established pursuant to this subsection shall continue to exercise such powers and elect such officers as the township charter may authorize and shall exercise such other powers as towns exercise under general law. However, no township shall exercise the powers granted towns by Chapter 38 (§ [15.2-3800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3800/) et seq.) or by Article 1 (§ [15.2-3200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3200/) et seq.) of Chapter 32, or any extraterritorial authority granted towns by Chapter 22 (§ [15.2-2200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2200/) et seq.), except that a township created as a result of a consolidation of a city and county subsequent to July 1, 2011, may institute proceedings for annexation pursuant to Article 1 (§ [15.2-3200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3200/) et seq.) of Chapter 32 if the consolidation agreement permits a township to exercise such authority. The consolidated city shall exercise such powers in the township as were exercised by the county in the town prior to consolidation. Townships shall receive from the Commonwealth financial assistance in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided towns. A township may transfer all or part of the revenues it receives, the services it performs, its facilities, other assets, and debts to the consolidated city by agreement of the governing bodies.
