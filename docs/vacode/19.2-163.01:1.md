Such additional compensation shall be wholly payable from the funds of any such county or city.

B. Due to the privileged and protected nature of the attorney-client relationship and the statutory scope of representation provided in §§ [19.2-157](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-157/) and [19.2-163.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-163.3/), no county or city providing a supplement to compensation under this section shall place any condition or requirement upon the receipt of such funds.
