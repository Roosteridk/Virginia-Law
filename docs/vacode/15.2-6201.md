# ยง 15.2-6201 Findings of fact.

The economy of the Alleghany-Highlands region has not kept pace with that of the rest of the Commonwealth. The economic problems of the Alleghany-Highlands region are due in large part to its inability to diversify. The region has suffered, and continues to suffer, widespread unemployment in great disproportion to the rest of the Commonwealth.

The Alleghany-Highlands Economic Development Authority will assist this region of the Commonwealth to achieve a greater degree of economic stability.

It is hereby further declared that the foregoing is a public purpose and use for which public moneys may be spent and such activity will serve a public purpose in providing jobs to the citizens of the Commonwealth.
