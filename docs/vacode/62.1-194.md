When a violation of any provision of this section has been observed by any person, and the matter dumped or disposed of in the waters of this Commonwealth has been ejected from a boat, the owner or operator of such boat shall be presumed to be the person ejecting such matter; provided, however, that such presumption shall be rebuttable by competent evidence. Every such act shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or confinement in jail not to exceed thirty days, or both. Every law-enforcement officer of this Commonwealth and its subdivisions shall have authority to enforce the provisions of this section.
