# ยง 2.2-3600 Short title; declaration of legislative intent.

A. This chapter may be cited as the Virginia State Government Volunteers Act.

B. Since the spirit of volunteerism has long animated generations of Americans to give of their time and abilities to help others, the Commonwealth would be wise to make use of volunteers in state service wherever practically possible. Effective use of volunteers in state service, however, requires that state agencies be provided guidelines for the development of volunteer programs and the utilization of volunteers. The General Assembly intends by this chapter to assure that people of Virginia may derive optimal benefit from volunteers, and that the time and talents of volunteers in state service may be put to their best use.
