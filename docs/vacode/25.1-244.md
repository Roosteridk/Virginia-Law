Such interest shall be paid for the period from the time of such entry by the petitioner until the time the fund paid into court on account of the final award of just compensation to such owner is available for distribution. Interest accruing prior to July 1, 1970, shall be paid at the rate of five percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 1981, shall be paid at the rate of six percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 2003, shall be paid at the rate of eight percent annually; and interest accruing thereafter shall be paid at not less than the judgment rate of interest as set forth in § [8.01-382](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-382/). No interest shall be payable upon any amount that was withheld from such owner on account of questions involving his right, title, interest or estate in the land or other property taken or damaged.

Such interest shall be paid for the period from the time of such entry until payment into court of the sum ascertained in the report of just compensation as provided in § [25.1-237](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-237/).

D. If the petitioner fails to pay into court any sum necessary for paying the total award that has been confirmed finally or the interest to which the owner is entitled under this section for a period of 30 days after the time for noting an appeal, the court shall enter judgment therefor against the petitioner, unless the proceedings have been dismissed in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (§ [25.1-248](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-248/) et seq.) of this chapter.

E. Interest allowable under the provisions of this section shall be reduced to the extent the fund has accrued interest during the pendency of the suit in the account required by § [25.1-224](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-224/).
