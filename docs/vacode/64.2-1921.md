# § 64.2-1921 Effect on existing custodianships.

A. Any transfer of custodial property as now defined in this chapter made before July 1, 1988, is validated notwithstanding that there was no specific authority in the Virginia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (former §§ 31-26 through 31-36) for the coverage of custodial property of that kind or for a transfer from that source at the time the transfer was made.

B. This chapter applies to all transfers made before July 1, 1988, in a manner and form prescribed in the Virginia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (former §§ 31-26 through 31-36) except insofar as the application impairs constitutionally vested rights.
