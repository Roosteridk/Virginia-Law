# ยง 22.1-289.054 Visitation by parents or guardians in child day programs.

A custodial parent or guardian shall be admitted to any child day program. For purposes of this section, "child day program" is one in which a person or organization has agreed to assume responsibility for the supervision, protection, and well-being of a child under the age of 13 for less than a 24-hour period, regardless of whether it is licensed. Such right of admission shall apply only while the child is in the child day program.
