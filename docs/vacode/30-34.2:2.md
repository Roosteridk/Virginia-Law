For the purposes of this section, "unclaimed firearms and other weapons" means any firearm or other weapon belonging to another that has been acquired by a law-enforcement officer pursuant to his duties, that is not needed in any criminal prosecution, that has not been claimed by its rightful owner, and that the State Treasurer has indicated will be declined if remitted under the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ [55.1-2500](/vacode/55.1-2500/) et seq.), and "unclaimed personal property" means any personal property belonging to another that has been acquired by a law-enforcement officer pursuant to his duties, that is not needed in any criminal prosecution, that has not been claimed by its rightful owner, and that the State Treasurer has indicated will be declined if remitted under the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ [55.1-2500](/vacode/55.1-2500/) et seq.).

At the discretion of the chief of police or his designee, the Division of Capitol Police may destroy unclaimed firearms or other weapons by any means that renders the firearms or other weapons permanently inoperable and may lawfully dispose of other unclaimed personal property. Prior to the destruction of such unclaimed firearms or other weapons or disposal of such other unclaimed personal property, the chief of police or his designee shall (i) make reasonable attempts to notify by mail the rightful owner of the property and (ii) obtain from the attorney for the Commonwealth of the jurisdiction from which the unclaimed item came into the possession of the Division of Capitol Police in writing a statement advising that the item is not needed in any criminal prosecution.

In lieu of destroying any such unclaimed firearm, the chief of police or his designee may donate the firearm to the Department of Forensic Science, upon agreement of the Department.
