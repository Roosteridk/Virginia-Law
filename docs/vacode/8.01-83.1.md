# ยง 8.01-83.1 Open-market sale, sealed bids, or auction.

A. If the court orders a sale of property in a partition action under the provisions of ยง [8.01-83](/vacode/8.01-83/), the sale shall be an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or at auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interests of the parties as a group.

B. If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later than 10 days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in the Commonwealth to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in the Commonwealth to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission. The broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the terms and conditions established by the court, including setting a reasonable time for marketing the property at its court-determined value pursuant to ยง [8.01-81.1](/vacode/8.01-81.1/).

C. If the broker appointed under subsection B obtains within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value:

1. The broker shall promptly file a report containing (i) a description of the property to be sold to each buyer; (ii) the name of each buyer; (iii) the proposed purchase price; (iv) the terms and conditions of the proposed sale, including the terms of any owner financing; (v) the amounts to be paid to lienholders; (vi) a statement of contractual or other arrangements or conditions of the broker's commission; and (vii) other material facts relevant to the sale; and

2. The court shall hold a hearing to approve the same and shall appoint a special commissioner to make the sale and execute the deed pursuant to Article 11 (ยง [8.01-96](/vacode/8.01-96/) et seq.).

D. If the broker appointed under subsection B does not obtain within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value, the court, after a hearing, may:

1. Approve the highest outstanding offer, if any;

2. Redetermine the value of the property and order that the property continue to be offered for an additional period of time; or

3. Order that the property be sold by sealed bids or at auction.

E. If the court orders a sale by sealed bids or at auction, the court shall set terms and conditions of such sale by sealed bids or an auction.

F. If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the proceeds.
