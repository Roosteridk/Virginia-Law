# ยง 38.2-5210 Nonforfeiture benefit.

A long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth unless the policyholder or certificateholder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy including a nonforfeiture benefit, as provided in regulations promulgated by the Commission. The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy or certificate. If the policyholder or certificateholder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.
