The Department may, after a hearing had upon notice, duly served not less than ten days prior to the date set for such hearing, impose a penalty, which shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter, not exceeding $2,500, upon any licensed motor carrier violating any provision of this chapter or the IFTA, or failing to comply with IFTA or any regulation of the Department promulgated pursuant to this chapter. Each such failure or violation shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty shall be collectible by the process of the Department as provided by law. Any person against whom an order or decision of the Commissioner has been adversely rendered relating to the tax imposed by this chapter may, within fifteen days of such order or decision, appeal from such an order or decision to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. In addition to imposing such penalty, or without imposing any penalty, the Department may suspend or revoke any certificate, permit or other evidence of right issued by the Department which the motor carrier holds.
