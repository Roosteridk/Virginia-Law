# § 2.2-4015 Effective date of regulation; exception.

A. A regulation adopted in accordance with this chapter and the Virginia Register Act (§ [2.2-4100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4100/) et seq.) shall become effective at the conclusion of the thirty-day final adoption period provided for in subsection D of § [2.2-4013](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4013/), or any other later date specified by the agency, unless:

1. A legislative objection has been filed in accordance with § [2.2-4014](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4014/), in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn by the agency, shall become effective on a date specified by the agency that shall be after the expiration of the applicable twenty-one-day extension period provided in § [2.2-4014](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4014/);

2. The Governor has exercised his authority in accordance with § [2.2-4013](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4013/) to require the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn by the agency, shall become effective on a date specified by the agency that shall be after the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment;

3. The Governor and (i) the appropriate standing committees of each house of the General Assembly or (ii) the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules have exercised their authority in accordance with subsection B of § [2.2-4014](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4014/) to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or

4. The agency has suspended the regulatory process in accordance with § [2.2-4007.06](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.06/), or for any reason it deems necessary or appropriate, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn by the agency, shall become effective in accordance with subsection B.

B. Whenever the regulatory process has been suspended for any reason, any action by the agency that either amends the regulation or does not amend the regulation but specifies a new effective date shall be considered a readoption of the regulation for the purposes of appeal. If the regulation is suspended under § [2.2-4007.06](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.06/), such readoption shall take place after the thirty-day public comment period required by that subsection. Suspension of the regulatory process by the agency may occur simultaneously with the filing of final regulations as provided in subsection B of § [2.2-4013](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4013/).

When a regulation has been suspended, the agency must set the effective date no earlier than fifteen days from publication of the readoption action and any changes made to the regulation. During that fifteen-day period, if the agency receives requests from at least twenty-five persons for the opportunity to comment on new substantial changes, it shall again suspend the regulation pursuant to § [2.2-4007.06](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.06/).

C. This section shall not apply to the issuance by the State Air Pollution Control Board of variances to its regulations.
