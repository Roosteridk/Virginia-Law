# ยง 54.1-3103.1 Administrator required for operation of assisted living facility; operation after death, illness, etc., of administrator; notification of Board; administrators operating more than one facility.

A. All licensed assisted living facilities within the Commonwealth shall be under the supervision of an administrator licensed by the Board, except as provided in subsection B of ยง [54.1-3102](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-3102/). If a licensed assisted living facility administrator dies, resigns, is discharged, or becomes unable to perform his duties, the assisted living facility may continue to operate with an acting administrator in accordance with the provisions of ยง [63.2-1803](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1803/). The facility shall immediately notify the Board of Long-Term Care Administrators and the regional licensing office of the Department of Social Services that the assisted living facility is operating without the supervision of a licensed assisted living facility administrator and shall provide the last date of employment of the licensed administrator. When an acting administrator is named, he shall notify the Department of Social Services of his employment and, if he is intending to assume the position permanently, submit a completed application for an approved administrator-in-training program to the Board within 10 days of employment.

B. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit an assisted living administrator from serving as the administrator of record for more than one assisted living facility as permitted by regulations of the licensing authority for the facility.
