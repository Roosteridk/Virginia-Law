# § 3.2-6031 Definitions.

As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:

"Garbage" means animal and vegetable wastes resulting from the handling, preparation, cooking, and consumption of foods containing animal carcasses or parts thereof. The Commissioner may in his discretion exclude from this definition such wastes that have been heat treated to the extent that the resultant material is of a uniform consistency, contains by analysis not more than 10 percent moisture, and that he has determined to be nonputrescible. Such treated nonputrescible wastes shall be "commercial feed" as the term is defined in § [3.2-4800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4800/), and shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 48 (§ [3.2-4800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4800/) et seq.).
