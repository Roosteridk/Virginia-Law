A. Except as provided in subsection B, a farm, as defined in 21 C.F.R § 112.3(c), or farm mixed-type facility, as defined in 21 C.F.R § 112.3(c), with an average annual monetary value of produce, as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 112.3(c), sold during the previous three-year period of more than $25,000 on a rolling basis, adjusted for inflation using 2011 as the baseline year for calculating the adjustment, is a "covered farm" as used in this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning. A covered farm shall comply with all applicable requirements of 21 C.F.R Part 21, this chapter, or any provision of a regulation of the Board adopted pursuant to § [3.2-5148](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-5148/) when conducting a covered activity, as defined in 21 C.F.R § 112.3(c), on covered produce.

B. A farm is not subject to this chapter if it satisfies the requirements in 21 C.F.R. § 112.5, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not withdrawn the farm's exemption in accordance with the requirements of 21 C.F.R. § 112 Subpart R.

C. A farm is eligible for a qualified exemption and associated modified requirements in a calendar year if:

1. During the previous three-year period preceding the applicable calendar year, the average annual monetary value of the food, as defined in 21 C.F.R § 112.3(c), the farm sold directly to qualified end-users, as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 112.3(c), during such period exceeded the average annual monetary value of the food the farm sold to all other buyers during that period; and

2. The average annual monetary value of all food, as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 112.3(c), the farm sold during the three-year period preceding the applicable calendar year was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation, using 2011 as the baseline year for calculating the adjustment for inflation.

D. If a farm is eligible for a qualified exemption in accordance with 21 C.F.R. § 112.5, the farm is subject to the requirements of 21 C.F.R. § 112 Subparts A, O, Q, and R.

E. If a farm is eligible for a qualified exemption in accordance with 21 C.F.R. § 112.5, the farm is subject to the modified requirements established in 21 C.F.R. § 112.6(b).
