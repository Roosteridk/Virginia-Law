# § 32.1-48.05 Application of article; determination of exceptional circumstances; regulations; duties of the State Health Commissioner not be delegated.

A. Upon a determination by the State Health Commissioner that exceptional circumstances exist relating to one or more persons in the Commonwealth who are known to have been exposed to or infected with or reasonably suspected to have been exposed to or infected with a communicable disease of public health threat and that such exceptional circumstances render the procedures of Article 3.01 (§ [32.1-48.01](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-48.01/) et seq.) of this chapter to be insufficient control measures or that the individuals have failed or refused to comply voluntarily with the control measures directed by the State Health Commissioner in response to a communicable disease of public health threat, the State Health Commissioner may invoke the provisions of this article relating to quarantine and isolation.

B. The Board of Health shall promulgate regulations for the implementation of this article that shall (i) address the circumstances that are subject to the application of Article 3.01 (§ [32.1-48.01](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-48.01/) et seq.) of this chapter and the exceptional circumstances in which this article may be invoked by the State Health Commissioner; (ii) provide procedures to assure that any quarantine or isolation is implemented in the least restrictive environment; (iii) ensure that the essential needs of persons subject to an order of isolation issued pursuant to this article shall be met, including, but not limited to, food, water, and health care, e.g., medications, therapies, testing, and durable medical equipment; (iv) provide procedures for proper notice of orders of quarantine and orders of isolation; (v) provide procedures for the State Health Commissioner to issue an emergency detention order for persons for whom he has probable cause to believe that they may fail or refuse to comply with an order of quarantine or an order of isolation; and (vi) address any other issue or procedure covered herein that the Board deems to be properly the subject of regulation.

C. The powers granted to the State Health Commissioner pursuant to this article shall not be delegated to or invoked by any local or district health department director. However, in the event the State Health Commissioner, duly appointed and confirmed pursuant to § [32.1-17](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-17/), shall be unable to perform his duties pursuant to this article, any Deputy Commissioner, appointed by the State Health Commissioner and approved by the Board pursuant to § [32.1-22](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-22/), shall be authorized to invoke the provisions of this article.
