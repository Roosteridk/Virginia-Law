# ยง 22.1-161.2 Resolution by school board; approval or rejection by governing body; indebtedness evidenced by bonds.

Whenever a school board desires to contract with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System to borrow money for capital projects for school purposes, it shall adopt a resolution setting forth the purpose for which it is desired to borrow the money and the amount of such proposed borrowing. Such resolution shall be entered in the minutes of the school board, and a copy of the same, certified by the clerk of the school board, shall be submitted by the school board to the governing body of the county, city or town for its approval or rejection. If the governing body approves the resolution, it shall enter its approval in its minutes, and the school board may then endeavor to negotiate an agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System for the borrowing of such money. If agreement is reached, the question of borrowing such money on the terms agreed upon by the school board and the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System shall again be submitted to the governing body of the county, city or town for its approval or rejection. If the governing body approves the terms of the agreement, it shall enter its approval in its minutes, and the school board may then, by resolution entered in its minutes, provide for the issuance of negotiable bonds evidencing the indebtedness for sale to the Virginia Retirement System. Such bonds shall be issued in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
