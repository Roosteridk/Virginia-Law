In addition, the governing body may limit the use of such alternative due dates to persons qualifying under Prince William County's real estate tax exemption, tax deferral, or combination program of exemptions and deferrals adopted under the authority of Article 2 (§ [58.1-3210](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3210/) et seq.) of Chapter 32 of this title.

Such ordinance may provide for monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or semiannual installments, and may further provide that late payment penalties and interest shall accrue if each installment is not timely made. Should Prince William County adopt monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly due dates, said due dates may extend into the subsequent tax year, but shall not exceed more than 180 days from the first day of the subsequent tax year.
