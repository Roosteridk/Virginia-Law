All of the responsibilities imposed on dealers in Chapter 6 (§ [58.1-600](/vacode/58.1-600/) et seq.) shall apply to rentors for purposes of this article, except the provision in subsection A of § [58.1-615](/vacode/58.1-615/) requiring a sales or use tax return to be filed when the dealer is not liable to remit to the Tax Commissioner any tax for the period covered by the return.
