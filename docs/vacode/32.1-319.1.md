# ยง 32.1-319.1 Department to establish pilot program to use data analytics to mitigate risk of improper payments.

A. The Department shall conduct a pilot program to develop and implement means to mitigate the risk of improper payments to providers of services furnished under the state plan for medical assistance and all applicable waivers. The pilot program shall include the use of predictive modeling, provider profiling, trend analysis, and other analytics to identify providers with a high likelihood of fraud, abuse, or error and prevent payments on potentially fraudulent or erroneous claims from being made until such claims have been validated.

B. The Department may enter into a contract or agreement with a vendor for the operation of the pilot program to mitigate the risk of improper payments to providers of services furnished under the state plan for medical assistance and all applicable waivers required by this section. However, selection of a vendor shall be dependent on the demonstration of a proof of concept, prior to entering into a contract or agreement.
