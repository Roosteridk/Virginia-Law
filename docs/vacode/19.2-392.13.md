D. Upon request from any person to access a paper or a digital image of a court record, the clerk of court shall determine whether such record is open to public access and inspection. If the clerk of court determines that the court record has been sealed, such record shall not be provided to the requestor without an order from the court that entered the order to seal the court record. Any order from a court that allows access to a paper or a digital image of a court record that has been sealed shall only be issued for one or more of the purposes set forth in subsection C. Such order to access a paper or a digital image of a court record that has been sealed shall allow the requestor to photocopy such court record. No fee shall be charged to any person filing a motion to access a paper or a digital image of a court record that has been sealed if the person filing such motion is the same person who was arrested, charged, or convicted of the offense that was sealed.

E. No access shall be provided to electronic records in an appellate court, circuit court, or district court case management system maintained by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court or in a case management system maintained by a clerk of the circuit court for any arrest, charge, or conviction that was ordered to be sealed pursuant to § [19.2-392.7](/vacode/19.2-392.7/), [19.2-392.8](/vacode/19.2-392.8/), [19.2-392.9](/vacode/19.2-392.9/), [19.2-392.11](/vacode/19.2-392.11/), or [19.2-392.12](/vacode/19.2-392.12/), except to the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission for its research purposes.

F. If a pleading or case document in a court record that was sealed is included among other court records that have not been ordered to be sealed, the clerk of court shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of that record. The Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and any circuit court shall not be required to prohibit dissemination of any published or unpublished opinion relating to an arrest, charge, or conviction that was ordered to be sealed.

G. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall not seal any conviction or any charge that was deferred and dismissed after a finding of facts sufficient to justify a finding of guilt (i) in violation of federal regulatory record retention requirements or (ii) in violation of federal program requirements if the Department of Motor Vehicles is required to suspend a person's driving privileges as a result of a conviction or deferral and dismissal ordered to be sealed. Upon receipt of an order directing that an offense be sealed, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall seal all records if the federal regulatory record retention period has run and all federal program requirements associated with a suspension have been satisfied. However, if the Department of Motor Vehicles cannot seal an offense pursuant to this subsection at the time it is ordered, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall (a) notify the Department of State Police of the reason the record cannot be sealed and cite the authority prohibiting sealing at the time it is ordered; (b) notify the Department of State Police of the date, if known at the time when the sealing is ordered, on which such record can be sealed; (c) seal such record on that date; and (d) notify the Department of State Police when such record has been sealed within the Department of Motor Vehicles' records.

H. No arrest, charge, or conviction that has been sealed may be used to impeach the credibility of a testifying witness at any hearing or trial unless (i) its probative value, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect and (ii) the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to use it so that the party has a fair opportunity to contest its use.

I. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of sealed criminal history record information or any information from such records among law-enforcement officers and attorneys when such disclosures are made by such officers or attorneys while engaged in the performance of their duties for purposes solely relating to the disclosure or use of exculpatory, mitigating, and impeachment evidence or between attorneys for the Commonwealth when related to the prosecution of a separate crime.
