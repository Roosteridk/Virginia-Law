# ยง 55.1-2005 Apartments subject to individual titles and interests; recording; transfer of garage unit.

Once the property is established as a horizontal property regime, an apartment in the building is a separate parcel of real property and may be individually conveyed and encumbered, independent of the other apartments in the building, and the corresponding individual titles and interests shall be recordable. A garage unit sold to a co-owner as a limited common element may be sold or transferred by him to another co-owner in the same horizontal property regime independently of and separately from his apartment.
