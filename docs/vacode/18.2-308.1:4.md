Upon issuance of a protective order pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/), the court shall order the person who is subject to the protective order to (i) within 24 hours after being served with a protective order in accordance with subsection C of § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or subsection D of § [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/) (a) surrender any firearm possessed by such person to a designated local law-enforcement agency, (b) sell or transfer any firearm possessed by such person to a dealer as defined in § [18.2-308.2:2](/vacode/18.2-308.2:2/), or (c) sell or transfer any firearm possessed by such person to any person who is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing such firearm and (ii) within 48 hours after being served with a protective order in accordance with subsection C of § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or subsection D of § [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/), certify in writing, on a form provided by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, that such person does not possess any firearms or that all firearms possessed by such person have been surrendered, sold, or transferred and file such certification with the clerk of the court that entered the protective order. The willful failure of any person to certify in writing in accordance with this section that all firearms possessed by such person have been surrendered, sold, or transferred or that such person does not possess any firearms shall constitute contempt of court.

D. The person who is subject to a protective order pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/) shall be provided with the address and hours of operation of a designated local law-enforcement agency and the certification forms when such person is served with a protective order in accordance with subsection C of § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or subsection D of § [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/).

E. A law-enforcement agency that takes into custody a firearm surrendered to such agency pursuant to subsection C by a person who is subject to a protective order pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/) shall prepare a written receipt containing the name of the person who surrendered the firearm and the manufacturer, model, and serial number of the firearm and provide a copy to such person. Any firearm surrendered to and held by a law-enforcement agency pursuant to subsection C shall be returned by such agency to the person who surrendered the firearm upon the expiration or dissolution of the protective order entered pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/). Such agency shall return the firearm within five days of receiving a written request for the return of the firearm by the person who surrendered the firearm and a copy of the receipt provided to such person by the agency. Prior to returning the firearm to such person, the law-enforcement agency holding the firearm shall confirm that such person is no longer subject to a protective order issued pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/) and is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing a firearm. A firearm surrendered to a law-enforcement agency pursuant to subsection C may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § [15.2-1721](/vacode/15.2-1721/) if (i) the person from whom the firearm was seized provides written authorization for such disposal to the agency or (ii) the firearm remains in the possession of the agency more than 120 days after such person is no longer subject to a protective order issued pursuant to § [16.1-279.1](/vacode/16.1-279.1/) or [19.2-152.10](/vacode/19.2-152.10/) and such person has not submitted a request in writing for the return of the firearm.
