# § 33.2-1819 Procurement.

The Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ [2.2-4300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4300/) et seq.) shall not apply to this chapter; however, a responsible public entity may enter into an interim or a comprehensive agreement only in accordance with guidelines adopted by it as follows:

1. A responsible public entity may enter into an interim or a comprehensive agreement in accordance with guidelines adopted by it that are consistent with procurement through "competitive sealed bidding" as set forth in § [2.2-4302.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.1/) and subsection B of § [2.2-4310](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/).

2. A responsible public entity may enter into an interim or a comprehensive agreement in accordance with guidelines adopted by it that are consistent with the procurement of "other than professional services" through competitive negotiation as set forth in § [2.2-4302.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.2/) and subsection B of § [2.2-4310](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/). Such responsible public entity shall not be required to select the proposal with the lowest price offer, but may consider price as one factor in evaluating the proposals received. Other factors that may be considered include (i) the proposed cost of the qualifying transportation facility; (ii) the general reputation, qualifications, industry experience, and financial capacity of the private entity; (iii) the proposed design, operation, and feasibility of the qualifying transportation facility; (iv) the eligibility of the facility for priority selection, review, and documentation timelines under the responsible public entity's guidelines; (v) local citizen and public entity comments; (vi) benefits to the public; (vii) the private entity's compliance with a minority business enterprise participation plan or good faith effort to comply with the goals of such plan; (viii) the private entity's plans to employ local contractors and residents; (ix) the safety record of the private entity; (x) the ability of the facility to address the needs identified in the appropriate state, regional or local transportation plan by improving safety, reducing congestion, increasing capacity, enhancing economic efficiency, or any combination thereof; and (xi) other criteria that the responsible public entity deems appropriate.

A responsible public entity shall proceed in accordance with the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to subdivision 1 unless it determines that proceeding in accordance with the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to this subdivision is likely to be advantageous to the responsible public entity and the public, based on (a) the probable scope, complexity, or urgency of a project; (b) risk sharing including guaranteed cost or completion guarantees, added value, or debt or equity investments proposed by the private entity; or (c) an increase in funding, dedicated revenue source or other economic benefit that would not otherwise be available. When the responsible public entity determines to proceed according to the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to this subdivision, it shall state the reasons for its determination in writing. If a state agency is the responsible public entity, the approval of the Secretary shall be required as more specifically set forth in the guidelines before the comprehensive agreement is signed.

3. Interim or comprehensive agreements for maintenance or asset management services for a transportation facility that is a highway, bridge, tunnel, or overpass, and any amendment or change order thereto that increases the highway lane-miles receiving services under such an agreement, shall be procured in accordance with guidelines that are consistent with procurement through "competitive sealed bidding" as set forth in § [2.2-4302.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.1/) and subsection B of § [2.2-4310](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/). Furthermore, such contracts shall be of a size and scope to encourage maximum competition and participation by agency prequalified contractors and otherwise qualified contractors.

4. The provisions of subdivision 3 shall not apply to maintenance or asset management services agreed to as part of the initial provisions of any interim or comprehensive agreement entered into for the original construction, reconstruction, or improvement of any highway pursuant to this chapter and shall not apply to any concession that, at a minimum, provides for (i) the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of any transportation facility or (ii) the operation and maintenance of any transportation facility with existing toll facilities.

5. Nothing in this section shall require that professional services be procured by any method other than competitive negotiation in accordance with the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ [2.2-4300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4300/) et seq.).
