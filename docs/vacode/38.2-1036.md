# § 38.2-1036 Impairment of capital and surplus of foreign and alien company ground for suspension or revocation of license.

Each foreign and each alien insurer shall maintain at all times the minimum surplus, capital and surplus, or trusteed surplus required by §§ [38.2-1028](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1028/), [38.2-1029](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1029/), [38.2-1030](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1030/) or § [38.2-1031](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1031/). If the Commission finds an impairment of (i) the required minimum capital and surplus of any foreign stock insurer, (ii) the required minimum surplus of any foreign mutual insurer, or (iii) the required minimum trusteed surplus of any alien insurer, the Commission may order the insurer to eliminate the impairment and restore the minimum capital and surplus, minimum surplus or minimum trusteed surplus, to the amount required by law. The Commission may, by order served upon the insurer, prohibit the insurer from issuing any new policies while the impairment exists. If the insurer fails to comply with the Commission's order within a period of not more than ninety days, the Commission may, in the manner set out in Article 6 (§ [38.2-1040](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1040/) et seq.) of this chapter, suspend or revoke the license of the insurer to transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth.
