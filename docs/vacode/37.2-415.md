# ยง 37.2-415 Provisional and conditional licenses.

The Commissioner may issue a provisional license at any time to a provider that has previously been fully licensed when the provider is temporarily unable to comply with all licensing standards. The maximum term of a provisional license shall be six months. A provisional license may be renewed for a period not to exceed six months if the provider is not able to demonstrate compliance with all licensing regulations but demonstrates progress towards compliance. However, in no case shall the total period of provisional licensure exceed 12 successive months. A provisional license shall be prominently displayed by the provider in a format determined by the Commissioner at the site of the affected service and shall indicate thereon the violations of licensing standards to be corrected and the expiration date of the license. Whenever the Commissioner issues a provisional license, the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (ยง [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.) shall apply. Any person aggrieved by the final decision of the Commissioner to issue a provisional license shall be entitled to judicial review of such decision in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (ยง [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.).

The Commissioner may issue a conditional license to a provider to operate a new service in order to permit the provider to demonstrate compliance with all licensing standards. The maximum term of a conditional license shall be six months. A conditional license may be renewed, but in no case, whether renewed or not, shall the total period of conditional licensing be longer than 12 successive months.
