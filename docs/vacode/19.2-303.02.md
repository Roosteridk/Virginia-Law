# ยง 19.2-303.02 Modification of conditions of suspended sentence or probation to require fingerprinting.

In any case where the court has suspended the imposition or execution of a sentence or placed the defendant on probation, the court may modify the sentence or conditions of probation at any time within the period of suspension or supervision to require that the fingerprints and photograph of the defendant be taken by a law-enforcement officer as a condition of that suspended sentence or probation, but only upon a hearing after reasonable notice to both the defendant and the attorney for the Commonwealth.
