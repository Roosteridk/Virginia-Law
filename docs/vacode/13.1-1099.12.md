2. Judicial supervision or other judicial remedy is available in the winding up of the protected series to the same extent, in the same manner, and under the same conditions that apply under Article 9 (ยง [13.1-1046](/vacode/13.1-1046/) et seq.) in the winding up of a limited liability company.

B. When the affairs of a protected series have been wound up, the series limited liability company that established the protected series shall deliver to the Commission for filing a statement of designation cancellation setting forth:

1. The name of the protected series;

2. The identification number issued by the Commission to the protected series;

Upon the effective date of such certificate, the existence of the protected series shall cease, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings, and appropriate actions by members as provided in this chapter.

D. A series limited liability company does not complete its winding up until each of its protected series has completed its winding up.
