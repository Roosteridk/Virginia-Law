A. Each foreign savings institution authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth shall furnish to the Commissioner a copy of all periodic reports of examinations of the institution conducted by all supervisory agencies that examine the institution to determine its financial soundness. Such reports shall include the examination reports of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal examining agency. Such report copies shall be furnished to the Commissioner within 10 days after the institution receives the report and shall be in certified form or such other form as is acceptable to the Commissioner. In determining whether such institution is in sound financial condition, the Commissioner shall be entitled to rely solely on such examination reports.

The Commission shall enter into cooperative agreements with other supervisory authorities for purposes of determining the financial soundness of the foreign savings institutions doing business in the Commonwealth. The Commission may enter into joint actions with other supervisory authorities having concurrent jurisdiction over foreign savings institutions doing business in the Commonwealth or may take such actions independently to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter and assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable financial institution laws of the Commonwealth.
