# ยง 8.01-373 When property sells for more than claim, how surplus paid.

When property, the sale of which is indemnified, sells for more than enough to satisfy the execution, attachment, or distress warrant under which it is taken, the surplus shall be paid by the officer into the court where the indemnifying bond is required to be returned, or as such court may direct. The court wherein the surplus is held may make such order for the disposition thereof, either temporarily until the question as to the title of the property sold is determined, or absolutely, as in respect to the rights of those interested may seem to it proper.
