When the proceeds of sale of the real estate of an infant, incapacitated person, or cestui que trust are invested, or required to be invested under the direction of the circuit court, and the infant, incapacitated person, or cestui que trust does not reside in the Commonwealth, on the petition of a guardian, committee, conservator, or trustee lawfully appointed or qualified in the state or country of residence of the infant, incapacitated person, or cestui que trust, the court under whose direction such proceeds are so invested, or required to be invested, may, with the consent of the persons residing in the Commonwealth who would be the heirs of the infant, incapacitated person, or cestui que trust, if he were dead, order such proceeds to be paid and delivered to the foreign guardian, committee, conservator, or trustee, or his agent or attorney, and removed by him to the state or country in which he was appointed and qualified. The court may refuse to permit the payment and delivery if the court determines that the removal of the trust subject will defeat or conflict with the provisions of the deed, will, or other instrument creating the trust.
