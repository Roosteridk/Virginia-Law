# ยง 58.1-4121 Suspension or revocation of service permit; civil penalty.

A. The Director may suspend, revoke, refuse to renew, or assess a civil penalty against the holder of a service permit in a sum not to exceed $10,000, after notice and a hearing. Such service permit may, however, be temporarily suspended by the Director without prior notice, pending any prosecution, hearing, or investigation, whether by a third party or by the Director. A service permit may be suspended, revoked, or refused renewal by the Director for one or more of the following reasons:

1. Failure to comply with, or violation of, any provision of this chapter or any regulation or condition of the Department;

2. Failure to disclose facts during the application process that indicate that such service permit should not have been issued;

3. Conviction of a felony under the laws of the Commonwealth or any other state or of the United States subsequent to issuance of a service permit;

4. Failure to file any return or report, keep any record, or pay any fees or other charges required by this chapter;

5. Any act of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or conduct prejudicial to public confidence in the integrity of gaming operations;

6. A material change, since issuance of the service permit, with respect to any matters required to be considered by the Director under this chapter; or

7. Other factors established by Department regulation.

B. Actions taken by the Director pursuant to this section shall be final unless appealed in accordance with ยง [58.1-4105](/vacode/58.1-4105/). Suspension or revocation of a service permit for any violation shall not preclude criminal liability for such violation.
