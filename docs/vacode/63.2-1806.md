# ยง 63.2-1806 Hospice care.

Notwithstanding ยง [63.2-1805](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1805/), at the request of the resident, hospice care may be provided in an assisted living facility under the same requirements for hospice programs provided in Article 7 (ยง [32.1-162.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-162.1/) et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 32.1, if the hospice program determines that such program is appropriate for the resident. However, to the extent allowed by federal law, no assisted living facility shall be required to provide or allow hospice care if such hospice care restrictions are included in a disclosure statement that is signed by the resident prior to admission.
