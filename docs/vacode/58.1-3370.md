# § 58.1-3370 Appointment.

A. The circuit court having jurisdiction within each city and each county other than those counties operating under § [58.1-3371](/vacode/58.1-3371/) shall, in each tax year immediately following the year a general reassessment or annual or biennial assessment is conducted in such city or county, appoint for such city or county a board of equalization of real estate assessments, unless such county or city has a permanent board of equalization appointed according to law. In addition, at the request of the local governing body, the circuit court may appoint alternate members as provided in subsection B of § [58.1-3373](/vacode/58.1-3373/), and the provisions of that subsection shall apply mutatis mutandis.

B. The term of any board of equalization appointed under the authority of this section shall expire one year after the effective date of the assessment for which it was appointed. However, if a taxpayer applies to the commissioner of the revenue or other official performing the duties imposed on commissioners of the revenue for relief from a real property tax assessment prior to the expiration of the board of equalization's term, and the term of the board of equalization expires prior to a final determination on such application for relief, and the taxpayer advises the circuit court that he wishes to appeal the determination to the board of equalization, then the circuit court may reappoint the board of equalization to hear and act on such appeal.
