1. Property received in an entity distribution that is not:

a. Money; or

b. Tangible personal property of nominal value;

b. Treated for federal income tax purposes comparably to the treatment described in subdivision a.

E. A fiduciary may determine or estimate that money received in an entity distribution is a capital distribution:

a. Determines, on the basis of information known to the fiduciary, that the characterization is or may be incorrect; or

b. Owns or holds more than 50 percent of the voting interest in the entity;

2. By determining or estimating, on the basis of information known to the fiduciary or provided to the fiduciary by or on behalf of the entity, that the total amount of money and property received by the fiduciary in the entity distribution or a series of related entity distributions is or will be greater than 20 percent of the fair market value of the fiduciary's interest in the entity; or

3. If neither subdivision 1 nor 2 applies, by considering the factors in subsection F and the information known to the fiduciary or provided to the fiduciary by or on behalf of the entity.

(2) One or more business assets that are not sold to customers in the ordinary course of the business or other activity conducted by the entity; or

(3) One or more assets other than business assets, unless the entity's primary activity is to invest in assets to realize gain on the disposition of all or some of the assets;

c. If the entity's primary activity is to invest in assets to realize gain on the disposition of all or some of the assets, the gain realized on the disposition;

d. The entity's regular, periodic entity distributions;

H. If a fiduciary receives additional information about the application of this section to an entity distribution before the fiduciary has paid part of the entity distribution to a beneficiary, the fiduciary may consider the additional information before making the payment to the beneficiary and may change a decision to make the payment to the beneficiary.

I. If a fiduciary receives additional information about the application of this section to an entity distribution after the fiduciary has paid part of the entity distribution to a beneficiary, the fiduciary is not required to change or recover the payment to the beneficiary but may consider that information in determining whether to exercise the power to adjust under § [64.2-1038](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1038/).
