# § 8.01-513 Service upon corporation or limited liability company.

A. If the person upon whom there is a suggestion of liability as provided in § [8.01-511](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-511/) is a corporation, the summons shall be served upon an officer, an employee designated by the corporation other than an officer of the corporation, or, if there is no designated employee or the designated employee cannot be found, upon a managing employee of the corporation other than an officer of the corporation. If the judgment creditor or his attorney files with the court a certificate that he has used due diligence and that (i) no such officer or employee or other person authorized to accept such service can be found within the Commonwealth or (ii) such designated or managing employee found is also the judgment debtor, then such summons shall be served on the registered agent of the corporation or upon the clerk of the State Corporation Commission as provided in §§ [13.1-637](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-637/), [13.1-766](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-766/), [13.1-836](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-836/) and [13.1-928](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-928/). However, service on the corporation shall not be made upon a designated or managing employee who is also the judgment debtor. If the corporation intends to designate an employee for service, the corporation shall file a designation with the State Corporation Commission.

B. If the person upon whom there is a suggestion of liability as provided in § [8.01-511](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-511/) is a limited liability company, the summons shall be served upon a member, manager, or employee designated by the limited liability company for the purpose of such service or, if there is no designated member, manager, or employee, or the designated member, manager, or employee cannot be found, upon a managing employee of the limited liability company. If the judgment creditor or his attorney files with the court a certificate that he has used due diligence and that (i) no such member, manager, or employee or other person authorized to accept such service can be found within the Commonwealth or (ii) such designated member, manager, employee, or managing employee found is also the judgment debtor, then such summons shall be served on the registered agent of the limited liability company or upon the clerk of the State Corporation Commission as provided in § [13.1-1018](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1018/). However, service on the limited liability company shall not be made upon a designated member, manager, employee, or managing employee who is also the judgment debtor. If the limited liability company intends to designate a member, manager, or employee for service, the limited liability company shall file a designation with the State Corporation Commission.
