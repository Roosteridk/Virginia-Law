# ยง 33.2-3705 Decisions of the Authority.

A majority of voting members of the Authority shall constitute a quorum. Vacancies shall not be considered in the establishment of a quorum. Votes of the chief elected officers of localities, or their designees, appointed to the Authority shall be weighted, based upon population of the locality, as follows: (i) the chief elected officers, or their designees, from the Counties of Chesterfield and Henrico and the City of Richmond shall each receive four votes; (ii) the chief elected officer, or his designee, from the County of Hanover shall receive three votes; (iii) the chief elected officers, or their designees, from the Counties of Goochland, New Kent, and Powhatan shall each receive two votes; and (iv) the chief elected officers, or their designees, from the Town of Ashland and the County of Charles City shall each receive one vote. The Delegate and Senator appointed to the Authority and the member of the Commonwealth Transportation Board appointed by the Governor shall each receive one vote. Decisions of the Authority shall require an affirmative vote of those present and voting whose votes represent at least four-fifths of the population embraced by the Authority; however, no motion to fund a specific facility or service shall fail because of this population criterion if such facility or service is not located or to be located or provided or to be provided within the county or city whose chief elected officer's or elected official's, or its respective designee's, sole negative vote caused the facility or service to fail to meet the population criterion. The population of counties and cities embraced by the Authority shall be the population as determined by the most recently preceding decennial census, except that on July 1 of the fifth year following such census, the population of each county and city shall be adjusted, based on population estimates made by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia.
