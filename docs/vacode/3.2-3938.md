# ยง 3.2-3938 Misbranded pesticides.

Any pesticide or device is misbranded if:

1. Its labeling bears any statement, design, or graphic representation relative thereto or to its ingredients that is false or misleading in any particular;

2. It is an imitation of or is offered for sale under the name of another pesticide;

3. Its labeling bears any reference to registration under this chapter;

4. The accompanying labeling does not contain directions for use that are adequate for the protection of the public;

5. The label does not contain a warning or caution statement that may be necessary and, if complied with, adequate to prevent injury to man, other vertebrate animals, vegetation, and useful invertebrate animals;

6. The label does not bear an ingredient statement or guaranteed analysis statement on the immediate container of the retail package (and on the outside container or wrapper if such statement on the immediate container cannot be clearly read) that is presented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase. The Commissioner may permit the ingredient statement to appear prominently on some other part of the container if the size or form of the container makes it impracticable to place it on the part of the retail package that is presented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase;

7. Any words, statement, or other information required under this chapter to appear on the labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or graphic matter in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use;

8. In the case of an insecticide, fungicide, or herbicide, when used as directed or in accordance with commonly recognized safe practice, it shall be injurious to living man or other vertebrate animals or vegetation to which it is applied, or to the person applying such pesticide, excepting pests and weeds; or

9. In the case of a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, when used as directed it shall be injurious to living man or other vertebrate animals, or vegetation to which it is applied, or to the person applying such pesticide; provided that physical or physiological effects on plants or parts thereof shall not be deemed to be injury, when this is the purpose for which the plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant was applied, in accordance with the label claims and recommendations.
