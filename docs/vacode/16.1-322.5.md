1. Contracts entered into under the terms of this article shall be with an entity submitting an acceptable response pursuant to a request for proposals.

However, no such contract may be entered into unless the private contractor demonstrates that it has:

a. The qualifications, experience and management personnel necessary to carry out the terms of this contract;

b. The financial resources to provide indemnification for liability arising from detention home or other secure facility management projects;
