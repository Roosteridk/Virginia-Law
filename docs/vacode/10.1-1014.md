# ยง 10.1-1014 Validity.

A conservation easement is valid even though:

1. It is not appurtenant to an interest in real property;

2. It can be or has been assigned to another holder;

3. It is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law;

4. It imposes a negative burden;

5. It imposes affirmative obligations upon the owner of an interest in the burdened property or upon the holder;

6. The benefit does not touch or concern real property; or

7. There is no privity of estate or of contract.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a conservation easement may be created, conveyed, recorded, assigned, released, modified, terminated, or otherwise altered or affected in the same manner as other easements.
