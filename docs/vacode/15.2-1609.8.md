# § 15.2-1609.8 Payments to counties having certain optional forms of organization and government.

The Compensation Board shall, in the manner provided by law, determine the compensation and expense allowances for the sheriff, and his deputies, of each county which has adopted or hereafter adopts any form of county organization and government provided for in Chapter 5 (§ [15.2-500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-500/) et seq.), Chapter 6 (§ [15.2-600](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-600/) et seq.) or Chapter 8 (§ [15.2-800](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-800/) et seq.) of this title, so long as such county shall continue such form of county organization and government in effect in such county, as if such county had not adopted any such form of government, but the salaries and expense allowances shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury of such county. The actual compensation and expense allowance to be paid the sheriff, and his deputies, of any such county shall be fixed as provided in the form of county organization and government adopted by such county, without regard to the limits provided for in this article, and shall be paid by such county.

The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to any county which adopts and has in effect in such county any other optional form of county organization and government which may be provided by law, if such form of county organization and government shall provide that the entire compensation of the sheriff of such county shall be fixed by authorities of the county and paid by the county.
