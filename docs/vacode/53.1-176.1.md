# ยง 53.1-176.1 Enactment of the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders.

WHEREAS, the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers was established in 1937 and is the earliest corrections "compact" established among the states and has not been amended since its adoption more than 65 years ago; and

WHEREAS, that Compact is the only vehicle for the controlled movement of adult parolees and probationers across state lines, and it currently has jurisdiction over more than a quarter of a million offenders; and

WHEREAS, the complexities of that Compact have become more difficult to administer, and many jurisdictions have expanded supervision expectations to include currently unregulated practices such as victim input, victim notification requirements and sex offender registration; and

WHEREAS, after hearings, national surveys, and a detailed study by a task force appointed by the National Institute of Corrections, the overwhelming recommendation has been to amend the document to bring about an effective management capacity that addresses public safety concerns and offender accountability; and

WHEREAS, upon the adoption of this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, it is the intention of the General Assembly to repeal the previous interstate compact for the supervision of parolees and probationers on the effective date of this Compact; now, therefore,

The General Assembly enacts the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders as set out in ยง [53.1-176.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-176.2/).

2004, c. [407](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0407).
