# § 63.2-1925 Certain amount of income that may be withheld by lien or order.

Whenever a support lien, order to withhold and deliver property or order for withholding of income is served upon any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision or department of this Commonwealth asserting a support debt against income and there is any such income in the possession of such person, then that person shall withhold from the disposable income as defined in § [63.2-100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-100/) (i) the amount stated in the lien, the order to withhold and deliver property, or the order for withholding of income; or (ii) the maximum amount permitted under § [34-29](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/), whichever is less. The order shall show the maximum percentage of disposable income which may be withheld pursuant to § [34-29](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/). The lien or order to withhold and deliver shall continue to operate and require such person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of this Commonwealth to withhold the nonexempt portion of income at each succeeding income disbursement interval until the entire amount of the support debt stated in the lien has been withheld. The order for withholding of income continues until further notice by first-class or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by electronic means from the Department is received by the employer.
