# ยง 8.01-465.13:6 Effect of recognition of foreign-country judgment.

If the court in a proceeding under ยง [8.01-465.13:5](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-465.13:5/) finds that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition under this chapter then, to the extent that the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money, the foreign-country judgment is:

1. Conclusive between the parties to the same extent as the judgment of a sister state entitled to full faith and credit in the Commonwealth would be conclusive; and

2. Enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment rendered in the Commonwealth.

2014, c. [462](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0462).
