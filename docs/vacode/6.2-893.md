# § 6.2-893 Payment of balance of deceased person or person under disability.

Any bank may pay any balance on deposit to the credit of any deceased person or of any person under disability, to the personal representative, curator, conservator, or committee of such person upon a letter of qualification as such personal representative, curator, conservator or committee, issued by an appropriate court. The letter shall be sufficient authority for such transfer. Any such bank making such transfer shall no longer be liable for such deposit to any person. The presentation of a duly certified letter of qualification as personal representative, curator, conservator, or committee shall be conclusive proof of the jurisdiction of the court issuing the same. Payment to a fiduciary qualified under the law of a state other than the Commonwealth shall be in accordance with Article 2 (§ [64.2-1426](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1426/) et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 64.2 and § [64.2-609](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-609/).
