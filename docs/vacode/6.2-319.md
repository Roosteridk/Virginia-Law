# § 6.2-319 Loans by pension plans to participants.

A. As used in this section, "pension plan" includes an "employee pension benefit plan" or "pension plan" as defined in § 3(2) of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829).

B. Loans by a pension plan to an individual participating in the pension plan shall be lawfully enforced as agreed in the contract of indebtedness. No such participating individual, by way of defense or otherwise, shall avail himself of the provisions of this chapter, or any other law relating to interest or usury, to avoid or defeat the payment of interest or any other sum on any loan made by the pension plan. Nothing contained in any law relating to interest or usury shall be construed to prevent the recovery of such interest or other sum though it is more than otherwise lawful interest and though that fact appears on the face of the contract.
