# ยง 8.01-525.7 Trustee; rights and duties; compensation.

A trustee appointed pursuant to ยง [8.01-525.6](/vacode/8.01-525.6/) shall make written reports to the court as required by the court. The trustee may charge a fee of five percent of such salary, wages, or income received and disbursed by him; however, no public officer or employee who receives a full-time salary and who acts as trustee under this article shall retain such fee for his personal use.

The trustee, upon being appointed, shall give written notice to any person, firm, or corporation who may owe the debtor any salary, wages, or income, and upon receiving such notice such person, firm, or corporation shall pay to the trustee any salary, wages, or income that are owed to such debtor, at the time it would otherwise be due to the debtor.

The trustee may compromise and settle any claims against the debtor when he believes such compromise shall be for the benefit of all the creditors.
