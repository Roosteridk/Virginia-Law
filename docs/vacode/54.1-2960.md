# ยง 54.1-2960 Medical students in hospitals.

Subject to such restrictions as the Board, in consultation with the deans of the medical schools of this Commonwealth, may prescribe by regulation, third and fourth year medical students engaged in a course of study approved by the Board may be employed by legally established and licensed hospitals to prepare medical history information and perform physical examinations where such practice is confined strictly to persons who are bona fide patients within the hospital or who receive treatment and advice in an outpatient department of the hospital. Such students shall be responsible and accountable at all times to a licensed physician member of the hospital staff. This section shall not have the effect of removing the responsibility of the attending physician to assure that a licensed physician shall do a history and physical examination on each hospitalized patient.
