# ยง 2.2-122 Commercial use of seals of the Commonwealth.

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง [1-505](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/1-505/), the Governor may authorize the use of the seals of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes upon a finding that such use promotes an appropriate image of the Commonwealth, its heritage and its history, and that such use is carried out in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth. In considering whether the use of the seals in association with a product promotes an appropriate image of the Commonwealth, preference shall be given to products that (i) preserve traditional methods of production, including handcrafting techniques, (ii) enhance public appreciation of the Commonwealth's aesthetic values, and (iii) incorporate workmanship and materials of the highest quality. A prospective licensee shall be deemed qualified to protect and promote the image of the Commonwealth if it holds licenses to produce products associated with museums and sites of major historical importance in the Commonwealth, including but not limited to homes of Presidents of the United States and restored historical areas.

B. The Governor may direct the State Treasurer to cause to be minted gold, platinum, and silver coins for commemorative use that bear the seals of the Commonwealth on the obverse side of the coin and scenes of natural or historically significant locations in the Commonwealth as recommended by the Board of Directors of the Virginia Tourism Authority on the reverse side. Except as provided in subsection C, proceeds from the sale of such coins shall be deposited in the Cooperative Marketing Fund established pursuant to ยง [2.2-2319](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2319/).

C. The Secretary of the Commonwealth and the Director of the Division of Purchases and Supply shall assist the Governor in determining the appropriateness of (i) any contract entered into for the commercial use of the seals of the Commonwealth, (ii) the product intended to be sold, (iii) any marketing activities undertaken to promote the sale of the product, and (iv) the pricing structure, including royalties to be paid to the Commonwealth for such use and sale. Any such royalties paid to the Commonwealth shall be deposited in the general fund.
