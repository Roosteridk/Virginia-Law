# ยง 21-268 Contracts for collection.

Any commission, and any county, city or town in whole or in part embraced within the district, are authorized to enter into a contract or contracts on such terms and conditions as such contract or contracts may contain, providing for the collection by such county, city or town and payment over to the commission of the fees, rents or other charges charged or to be charged by the commission to the owners or lessees or tenants of real estate within such county, city or town, or providing for the payment to the commission by such county, city or town of a sum or sums of money in lieu of all or part of the fees, rents and other charges which would otherwise be charged by the commission to the owners or lessees or tenants of real estate within such county, city or town. Such county, city or town is vested with powers to do everything necessary or proper to carry out and perform every such contract, including the same powers with respect to fees, rents and other charges as are conferred by this chapter upon a commission, and to provide for the payment or discharge of any obligation thereunder by the same means and in the same manner as any other of its obligations, except that no tax shall be levied on real estate for such obligation. The commission is authorized to reduce ratably in accordance with such contract the fees, rents and other charges which would otherwise be charged by the commission to the owners or lessees or tenants of real estate within such county, city or town, but nothing in this section or any such contract shall be construed to prevent the commission from charging to and collecting from such owners or lessees or tenants of such real estate, in the same manner as provided for such fees, rents and other charges, any deficiency in any payment agreed to be made by such county, city or town.
