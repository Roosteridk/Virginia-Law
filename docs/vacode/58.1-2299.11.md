The Commissioner may, when in his judgment it is necessary and advisable so to do in order to secure the collection of the tax levied by this chapter, require any person subject to such tax to file with him a bond, with such surety as the Commissioner determines is necessary to secure the payment of any tax, penalty, or interest due or which may become due from such person. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the Commissioner may be deposited with the State Treasurer, which securities shall be kept in the custody of the State Treasurer and shall be sold by him, at the request of the Commissioner, at public or private sale if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax, penalty, or interest due the Commonwealth under this chapter. Upon any such sale, the surplus, if any, above the amounts due under this chapter shall be returned to the person who deposited the securities.
