2. From any railway company, supplier, mining company, or transshipper -- the tonnage and classification of coal loaded aboard such vessel;

3. From any transshipper -- the identity of any supplier, broker, transshipper, or purchaser of coal for shipment by railway;

4. From any ship line, shipping company, ship agent, wholesaler, retailer, broker, transshipper, or operator of any coal storage facility -- the identity of any vessel loaded with coal, the date of such vessel's arrival at port, the date such vessel departed and the tonnage and classification of coal loaded aboard such vessel; and

5. From any of the parties mentioned in subdivisions 1, 2, 3, or 4 -- any other information which is relevant and necessary to such analysis of shipment of coal through the ports of the Commonwealth provided such information is maintained in the ordinary course of business of such person, firm, or corporation.

B. Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, any person, firm, corporation or agent thereof engaged in the mining, consignment, sale, transportation, loading, unloading, storage, or handling of coal for shipment through any port of this Commonwealth, whether as a mining company, railway company, ship line, shipping company, ship agent, wholesaler, retailer, broker, transshipper, operator of any coal storage facility, or facility for the loading or unloading of railroad cars or ships, or any entity otherwise engaged in an activity which directly affects the transportation of coal to or from any port of this Commonwealth, within forty-five days after receiving a written request from the Authority, shall furnish the Authority with any such information as is described in subsection A of this section as is maintained in the ordinary course of business of the party requested to provide the information. In the event of willful noncompliance with the provisions of this section by any person, firm, or corporation, the Authority may petition an appropriate circuit court for injunctive relief or, in the alternative, for recovery of a civil penalty, payable to the Authority, in an amount no less than $100 per day and no more than $1,000 per day for each day noncompliance continues. Upon a finding that the defendant's noncompliance was willful, the court shall order compliance or payment of the civil penalty, as the case may be.

C. The aforesaid information and data shall be supplied to the Executive Director of the Authority and shall be for the exclusive use of the Executive Director and the staff of the Authority. Neither the Executive Director nor any staff member of the Authority shall disclose this information and data to any member of the Board of Commissioners of the Authority; nor to any person, firm, corporation or agent thereof engaged in the mining, consignment, sale, transportation, loading, unloading, storage, or handling of coal, whether such person, firm, corporation or agent be public or private and whether or not such person, firm, corporation, or agent be a subsidiary or unit of the Authority; nor to anyone outside the Authority.

D. In carrying out the functions heretofore described the Authority shall be deemed to be performing essential governmental functions as an agent of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
