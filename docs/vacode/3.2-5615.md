# § 3.2-5615 Appointment, terms and compensation of local sealers of weights and measures; discontinuance of local program.

The governing bodies of the respective counties and cities may appoint a sealer of weights and measures. However, two or more counties may appoint jointly a sealer subject to the approval of the Commissioner. Sealers appointed under this chapter shall hold office for such terms and shall receive such salaries, as the appointing powers may prescribe. Such salaries shall be paid out of the county or city treasury, as the case may be. No county or city employing a sealer or sealers and conducting a weights and measures program shall discontinue the program without first giving the Commissioner 12 months' written notice of its intent to do so.
