# § 55.1-2441 Pendency of escheat proceedings no bar to condemnation proceedings.

Notwithstanding any provision contained in this chapter, the Commissioner of Highways or any locality or other political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth possessing the power of eminent domain, for a public purpose in accordance with the law and notwithstanding the pendency of any proceeding brought for the escheat of any land wanted and needed by such Commissioner of Highways or such locality or other political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth for such purpose, may institute, maintain, and conduct to final judgment condemnation proceedings to acquire in fee simple such land or such lesser estate, title, or interest therein as is wanted and needed for such public purpose, provided, however, that the escheator in whose name such escheat proceedings is pending and the Commonwealth are made codefendants to such condemnation proceedings, together with the owner, if known, of the land proposed to be condemned in such proceeding. The pendency of such escheat proceedings shall not constitute a bar or defense to such condemnation proceedings, nor to any proceeding therein seeking a right of entry as provided in § [25.1-223](/vacode/25.1-223/), in Chapter 3 (§ [25.1-300](/vacode/25.1-300/) et seq.) of Title 25.1, or in Article 1 (§ [33.2-1000](/vacode/33.2-1000/) et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 33.2. No escheator, after being served with notice of the filing of any such condemnation proceeding, shall sell or dispose of any land sought to be acquired in such condemnation proceeding except upon order entered by the court in which such condemnation proceeding is pending. The funds paid into court as compensation or damages for the land so taken or damaged shall, after payment of taxes and other claims constituting valid liens against the land so taken, be ordered distributed to the party entitled thereto or be ordered paid to the escheator of such land, or to the State Treasurer, as the court may direct.
