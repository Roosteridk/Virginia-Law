# § 57-61.1 Time and effect of registration.

A. Registrations by charitable organizations, professional solicitors, and professional fund-raising counsel are effective, if complete, upon receipt by the Commissioner. Incomplete registration forms and registration forms lacking required accompanying documents are not effective until completed or until the required accompanying documents are received by the Commissioner. No person shall be considered registered under this chapter for any purpose until his registration is complete.

B. If the Commissioner at any time determines that (i) the requirements of § [57-49](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-49/) or § [57-61](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-61/) have not been met or (ii) the registrant is violating any requirement of §§ [57-54](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-54/), [57-55.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-55.2/) or § [57-57](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-57/) or any regulations adopted pursuant to § [57-66](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-66/), then the Commissioner may suspend the registration until the registrant meets the requirements or complies and provides evidence thereof satisfactory to the Commissioner. The suspension may be based upon an informal conference pursuant to § [2.2-4019](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4019/) of the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.).

C. If the Commissioner finds that the public health, safety or welfare requires urgent action, and if he also finds reasonable cause to believe that the registrant has failed to comply with § [57-49](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-49/) or § [57-61](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-61/) or is violating §§ [57-54](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-54/), [57-55.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-55.2/) or § [57-57](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-57/) or any regulations adopted pursuant to § [57-66](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-66/), then the Commissioner may provide advance notice of as little as twenty-four hours for the conduct of the informal conference under § [2.2-4019](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4019/) of the Administrative Process Act.
