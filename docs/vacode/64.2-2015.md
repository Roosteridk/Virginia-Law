A. If a person is adjudicated incapacitated and in need of a guardian or conservator and the court has not identified any person to serve as guardian or conservator within one month from the adjudication, the court may appoint a local or regional program of the Virginia Public Guardian and Conservator Program authorized by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services pursuant to Article 6 (§ [51.5-149](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.5-149/) et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 51.5. If there is no such local or regional program within the court's jurisdiction, the court may appoint any local or regional program within 60 miles of the residence of the incapacitated person as identified by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. However, the court shall not appoint any such local or regional program that has reached or exceeded its ideal ratio of clients to staff pursuant to regulations adopted by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services under § [51.5-150](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.5-150/).

B. If any person appointed as a fiduciary under this title refuses the trust or fails to give bond as required within one month from the date of his appointment, the court, on motion of any interested person, may appoint some other person as fiduciary, taking from the fiduciary the bond required, or shall commit the estate of the respondent to the sheriff of the county or city where the respondent is an inhabitant; and the sheriff shall be the fiduciary, and he and the sureties in his official bond shall be bound for the faithful performance of the trust.
