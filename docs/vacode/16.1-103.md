# § 16.1-103 Proceedings by interrogatories.

Whenever a fieri facias has been issued upon a judgment rendered in a general district court the judge or clerk of the court may issue the summons provided for in § [8.01-506](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-506/). In such case the judge of the general district court shall have all of the powers and authority respecting interrogatories conferred by §§ [8.01-506](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-506/) to [8.01-510](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-510/) upon any court or judge mentioned therein. The commissioner before whom any person is required to appear by such summons shall have the same powers and authority as if such summons had been issued under § [8.01-506](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-506/). All interrogatories, answers, reports and other proceedings under such summons, and also all money, evidences of indebtedness and other security in the hands of an officer which are directed by any section of Chapter 18 (§ [8.01-466](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-466/) et seq.) of Title 8.01 to be returned or delivered to such court or judge, or to the clerk's office of such court, shall, when the summons was issued by a judge of a general district court be returned or delivered in like manner to the court from which the summons issued.

From any order of the judge of the general district court which involves the disposition of any money or property exceeding the sum of fifty dollars in value, exclusive of interest, there shall be an appeal in the same manner and upon the same conditions as in appeals from judgments rendered in civil matters in general district courts.
