A. Each insurer issuing or delivering a policy or contract of motor vehicle insurance that includes coverage for bodily injury or property damage liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use of any motor vehicle as provided in this chapter, shall suspend any coverage for any motor vehicle at the request of a named insured ordered to military duty outside this Commonwealth, or his personal representative, during any period that the motor vehicle is impounded in a motor vehicle impound lot on a military base of the United States Armed Forces, the Reserves of the United States Armed Forces or the National Guard.
