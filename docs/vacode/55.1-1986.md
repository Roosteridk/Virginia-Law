# ยง 55.1-1986 Cease and desist orders.

A. The Common Interest Community Board may issue an order requiring a person to cease and desist from any of the unlawful practices enumerated in subdivisions 1 through 5 and to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the Common Interest Community Board will carry out the purposes of this chapter if the Common Interest Community Board determines after notice and hearing that such person has:

1. Violated any provision of this chapter;

2. Directly or through an agent or employee knowingly engaged in any false, deceptive, or misleading advertising, promotional, or sales methods to offer or dispose of a unit;

3. Made any substantial change in the plan of disposition and development of the condominium subsequent to the order of registration without notifying the Common Interest Community Board;

4. Disposed of any units that have not been registered with the Common Interest Community Board; or

5. Violated any lawful order or regulation of the Common Interest Community Board.

B. If the Common Interest Community Board makes a finding of fact in writing that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, it may issue a temporary order to cease and desist or to take such affirmative action as may be deemed appropriate by the Common Interest Community Board. Prior to issuing the temporary order, the Common Interest Community Board shall give notice of the proposal to issue a temporary order to the person. Every temporary order shall include in its terms a provision that upon request a hearing will be held promptly to determine whether it becomes permanent.
