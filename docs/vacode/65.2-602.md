# § 65.2-602 Tolling of statute of limitations.

In any case where an employer has received notice of an accident resulting in compensable injury to an employee as required by § [65.2-600](/vacode/65.2-600/) and, whether or not an award has been entered, the employer has paid compensation or wages to such employee during incapacity for work, as defined in § [65.2-500](/vacode/65.2-500/) or [65.2-502](/vacode/65.2-502/), resulting from such injury or the employer has failed to file the report of said accident with the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission as required by § [65.2-900](/vacode/65.2-900/), or otherwise has under a workers' compensation plan or insurance policy furnished or caused to be furnished medical service to such employee as required by § [65.2-603](/vacode/65.2-603/), the statute of limitations applicable to the filing of a claim shall be tolled until the last day for which such payment of compensation or wages or furnishment of medical services as described above is provided and that occurs more than six months after the date of accident. However, no such payment of wages or workers' compensation benefits or furnishment of medical service as described above occurring after the expiration of the statute of limitations shall apply to this provision. In the case where the employer has failed to file a first report, the statute of limitations shall be tolled during the duration thereof until the employer filed the first report of accident as required by § [65.2-900](/vacode/65.2-900/). In the event that more than one of the above tolling provisions applies, whichever of those causes the longer period of tolling shall apply.
