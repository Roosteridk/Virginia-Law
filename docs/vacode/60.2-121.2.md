# ยง 60.2-121.2 Electronic submission of information; payments.

A. Each employer subject to the provisions of this title shall submit claim-related forms, including separation information, using an electronic format as prescribed by the Commission, unless the employer has been granted a waiver by the Commission. An employer shall submit any other information related to a claim, as defined in ยง [60.2-528.1](/vacode/60.2-528.1/), at any time when requested by the Commission, to the Commission by electronic means, unless the employer has been granted a waiver by the Commission. The Commission may also require, at any time, that an employer submit unemployment insurance tax payments electronically, unless the employer has been granted a waiver by the Commission.

B. The Commission may grant a waiver to an employer from providing information or payments electronically pursuant to this section at any time. The Commission may grant a waiver only if the Commission finds that the electronic submission requirement creates an unreasonable burden on the employer. All requests for a waiver shall be submitted in writing.
