# § 38.2-3228 Proration of values; additional benefits.

For any contract that provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall equal the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and any minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ [38.2-3222](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3222/) through [38.2-3225](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3225/) and [38.2-3227](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3227/), additional benefits payable (i) in the event of total and permanent disability, (ii) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (iii) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all the additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this article. The inclusion of these additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.
