1. To those persons presumed to be wholly dependent upon the deceased employee as set forth in subdivisions A 1 and 2 of § [65.2-515](/vacode/65.2-515/), for a period of 500 weeks from the date of injury; or

2. If there are no total dependents pursuant to subdivision A 1 or 2 of § [65.2-515](/vacode/65.2-515/), to those persons presumed to be wholly dependent as set forth in subdivision A 3 of § [65.2-515](/vacode/65.2-515/), and to those determined to be wholly dependent in fact, for a period of 400 weeks from the date of injury; or
