# § 3.2-4211 Quarterly escrow payments by certain nonparticipating manufacturers.

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/), on and after January 1, 2007, the Attorney General may require a nonparticipating manufacturer that is a new market entrant or that has been designated by the Attorney General as an elevated risk pursuant to subsection C of § [3.2-4206.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4206.1/) to make the escrow payments required by § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/) on a quarterly, rather than annual basis. For the purposes of this section, a "new market entrant" shall mean a tobacco product manufacturer that first seeks certification pursuant to § [3.2-4205](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4205/) on or after January 1, 2007.

B. A nonparticipating manufacturer required to make quarterly payments pursuant to this section shall place into a qualified escrow account the amounts required pursuant to subdivision A 2 of § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/) by the fifteenth of the second month following the end of each calendar quarter, except the payment for the last quarter of a calendar year shall be made by April 15 of the year following the year in question. Any adjustments for inflation to the amounts placed into a qualified escrow pursuant to this section shall be reflected in the payments for the last quarter of a calendar year.

C. A nonparticipating manufacturer required to make payments pursuant to this section shall also provide the certification required by subsection C of § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/) on a quarterly basis. Any such nonparticipating manufacturer that fails in any quarter to place into escrow the funds required under this section shall be subject to the penalty provisions of § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/).

D. The Attorney General is authorized to create any forms and require any nonparticipating manufacturer required to make quarterly payments pursuant to this section to submit any additional information as is necessary to enable the Attorney General to determine whether the nonparticipating manufacturer is in compliance with the provisions of this section. At the time the nonparticipating manufacturer is first certified by the Attorney General pursuant to § [3.2-4205](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4205/) or at any time that the nonparticipating manufacturer is designated by the Attorney General as an elevated risk pursuant to subsection C of § [3.2-4206.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4206.1/), the Attorney General will notify the nonparticipating manufacturer as to whether it will be required to make quarterly payments pursuant to this section. The Attorney General may seek an injunction to compel compliance with the reporting requirements. In any action brought pursuant to this subsection in which the Commonwealth prevails, the Commonwealth shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs of investigation, costs of the action, and reasonable attorney fees.

E. A nonparticipating manufacturer required to make quarterly payments pursuant to this section who fails to properly do so shall be deemed to have failed to make required payments pursuant to § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/) and shall be subject to all enforcement actions available for a violation of § [3.2-4201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/).

F. A nonparticipating manufacturer required to make quarterly payments pursuant to this section who, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, has complied with the provisions of Article 1 (§ [3.2-4200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/) et seq.) of this chapter and the provisions of this article for a period of at least three calendar years may, upon request and upon the concurrence of the Attorney General, be permitted to make annual payments pursuant to Article 1 (§ [3.2-4200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/) et seq.) of this chapter and be relieved of further obligation to make quarterly payments.
