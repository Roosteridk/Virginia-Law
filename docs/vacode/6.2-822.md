# § 6.2-822 Merger and share exchange by state banks.

A. Virginia banks as defined in § [6.2-849](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-849/) may merge upon compliance with the provisions of Article 12 (§ [13.1-715.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-715.1/) et seq.) of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act. The provisions of:

1. Section [13.1-716](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-716/) that relate to a merger with a foreign corporation as foreign eligible entity shall not apply, except that the provisions of § [13.1-716](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-716/) relating to merger shall apply to the merger of a state and a national bank if the national bank is engaged in business in Virginia, and if the state bank is to be the surviving bank; and

2. Section [13.1-730](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-730/) shall not apply to a merger under this section.

B. A national bank shall be treated as if it were a foreign corporation and as if the United States were the state where it is organized. A bank may enter into a share exchange, as permitted by § [13.1-717](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-717/), provided there is also compliance with Chapter 7 (§ [6.2-700](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-700/) et seq.). The exclusion in subdivision G 3 of § [6.2-705](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-705/) shall not apply in the case of such an exchange of shares.

C. In the event of a merger authorized by subsection A or B, the merged corporation, whether it be one of merging banks, or a new bank formed by means of such merger, shall without further act or deed succeed to, and be vested with all offices, rights, obligations and relations of trust or of a fiduciary nature, including appointments, designations and nominations, existing immediately prior to the time at which such merger became effective, or then belonging or pertaining to any one or more of the banks, parties to such merger, or which would then inure to any one or more of such banks.

D. No state bank resulting from any merger shall do business in the Commonwealth until it shall have obtained from the Commission a certificate of authority authorizing it to do so. The provisions of § [6.2-816](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-816/) shall apply to the issuance, or refusal of the Commission to issue, the certificate herein provided for, to the same extent as if the merged bank were a new bank.

E. In the case of a merger heretofore or hereafter effected, the surviving or new bank shall be deemed to have been in actual operation for the period during which the oldest of the banks involved in the merger has been in actual operation.
