A. On and after July 1, 1998, every person seeking to qualify in any fiduciary capacity before the circuit court or clerk shall provide to the court or clerk the information required to make the qualification on forms provided to the proposed fiduciary by the clerk. The forms, with appropriate instructions concerning their use, shall be provided to each clerk by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court. In lieu of any form, a computer-generated facsimile of the form may be used by any person seeking to qualify.

B. Every qualified fiduciary who moves from the Commonwealth and becomes resident in another state shall inform the clerk and the commissioner of accounts of the court in which he was qualified of his new address within 30 days of the date of the change in residency. Any fiduciary who fails to so inform the clerk and commissioner of accounts shall be subject to a civil penalty of $50.

This section shall not apply to any fiduciary whose cofiduciary is a resident of the Commonwealth.
