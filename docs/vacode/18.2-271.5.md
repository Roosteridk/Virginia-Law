# § 18.2-271.5 Restricted permits to operate a motor vehicle; ignition interlock systems.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any criminal case for any violation of Article 7 ( § [46.2-852](/vacode/46.2-852/) et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 46.2 where a defendant's license to operate a motor vehicle, engine, or train in the Commonwealth is subject to revocation or suspension and the court orders a defendant, as a condition of probation or otherwise, to enter into and successfully complete an alcohol safety action program in the judicial district in which such charge is brought or in any other judicial district upon such terms and conditions as the court may set forth, the court may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, issue the defendant a restricted license to operate a motor vehicle in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of § [18.2-271.1](/vacode/18.2-271.1/) where the only restriction of such restricted license that the court shall impose is to prohibit the defendant from operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock system for a period of not less than six consecutive months without alcohol-related violations of the interlock requirements.

In no event shall a defendant be permitted to enter any such alcohol safety action program that is not certified as meeting minimum standards and criteria established by the Commission on the Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program (VASAP) pursuant to § [18.2-271.2](/vacode/18.2-271.2/).

No restricted license issued pursuant to this section shall permit any person to operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in the Virginia Commercial Driver's License Act (§ [46.2-341.1](/vacode/46.2-341.1/) et seq.).

The provisions of subsections E and F of § [18.2-271.1](/vacode/18.2-271.1/) shall apply to this section mutatis mutandis, except as herein provided.
