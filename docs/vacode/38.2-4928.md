1. For continuing care at a facility or community-based continuing care which has not registered under this chapter; or

2. Without having first provided to such person a disclosure statement that does not (i) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or (ii) omit a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they are made.
