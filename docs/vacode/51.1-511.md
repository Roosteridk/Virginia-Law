Any amount of group life, accidental death, and dismemberment insurance in force on any employee at the date of his death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the beneficiary designated by the employee under the provisions of the Virginia Retirement System or other retirement system administered by the Board, unless the employee has designated and filed with the Board on a form prepared by the Board, a different beneficiary of his group life, accidental death, and dismemberment insurance.
