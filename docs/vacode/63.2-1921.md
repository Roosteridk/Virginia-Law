# § 63.2-1921 Authority to initiate reviews of certain orders.

A. The Department may, pursuant to this chapter and in accordance with § [20-108.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.2/), initiate a review of the amount of support ordered by any court. If a material change in circumstances has occurred, the Department shall report its findings and a proposed modified order to the court which entered the order or the court having current jurisdiction. Notice of each review shall be served on the nonrequesting party (i) in accordance with the provisions of § [8.01-296](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-296/), [8.01-327](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-327/), or [8.01-329](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-329/), (ii) by certified mail, return receipt requested, (iii) by electronic means, or (iv) by the nonrequesting party executing a waiver. Either party may request a hearing on the proposed modified order by filing a request with such court within 30 days of receipt of notice by the requesting party. Unless a hearing is requested within the time limits, no hearing shall be required and the court shall enter the modified order, which shall be effective from the date that notice of such review was served on the nonrequesting party. The court shall modify any prior court order, or schedule a hearing on its motion and so notify the parties and the Department. If a hearing is held, the Department shall have the burden of proof.

B. However, if the order being reviewed by the Department deviated from the guidelines, when entered, based on one or more of the deviating factors set out in § [20-108.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.1/) and the Department determines that there has been a material change in circumstances, the procedure set forth in subsection A shall not apply and the Department shall schedule a hearing with the court which entered the order or the court having current jurisdiction.

C. A material change in circumstances shall be deemed to have occurred if the difference between the existing child support award and the amount which would result from application of the guidelines is at least 10 percent of the existing child support award but not less than $25 per month.
