# ยง 15.2-4005 Effect when city becomes town; officers.

When a city becomes a town under the provisions of this chapter, its ordinances shall become the ordinances of the town, insofar as they are applicable and consistent with law, until they are repealed, and the existence of such city as an independent city of the Commonwealth shall terminate, as shall the terms of office and the rights, powers, duties and compensation of its constitutional officers and their deputies and employees. All officers, agents and employees of the city, including the mayor and the members of city council, shall continue to serve as the officers, agents and employees of the town, until they are terminated as provided by law, or in the case of the mayor and members of council, until their successors are elected or appointed. The court shall order an election to be held pursuant to ยง [24.2-682](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-682/) not less than thirty nor more than 180 days after the date of the court order granting town status, but at least thirty days before the effective date of the transition from city to town status, at which election the town council and other elected officers of the town shall be selected. The terms of such officers shall commence on the day the transition from city to town status becomes effective and shall continue, unless otherwise removed, until their successors have been elected and assume office. The successors or all such officers whose first election is herein provided for shall thereafter be elected at the time, in the manner and for the terms provided by general law.
