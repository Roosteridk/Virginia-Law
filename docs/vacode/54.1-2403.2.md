# § 54.1-2403.2 Record storage.

A. Health records, as defined in § [32.1-127.1:03](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-127.1:03/), may be stored by computerized or other electronic process or microfilm, or other photographic, mechanical, or chemical process; however, the stored record shall identify the location of any documents or information that could not be so technologically stored. If the technological storage process creates an unalterable record, a health care provider licensed, certified, registered or issued a multistate licensure privilege by a health regulatory board within the Department shall not be required to maintain paper copies of health records that have been stored by computerized or other electronic process, microfilm, or other photographic, mechanical, or chemical process. Upon completing such technological storage, paper copies of health records may be destroyed in a manner that preserves the patient's confidentiality. However, any documents or information that could not be so technologically stored shall be preserved.

B. Notwithstanding the authority given in this section to store health records in the form of microfilm, prescription dispensing records maintained in or on behalf of any pharmacy registered or permitted in Virginia shall only be stored in compliance with §§ [54.1-3410](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-3410/), [54.1-3411](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-3411/), and [54.1-3412](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-3412/).
