# § 45.2-715  Examination and testing of roof, face, and ribs.

A. The operator or his agent shall instruct every miner on how to visually examine and conduct sound and vibration testing of roof, face, and ribs.

B. Any miner exposed to danger from a fall of roof, face, or ribs shall visually examine and, if conditions permit, test the roof, face, and ribs by sounding the roof before starting work or before starting a machine and as needed thereafter to ensure safety. If hazardous conditions are found, the miner discovering such conditions shall either (i) correct the conditions immediately by taking down the loose material, installing proper timbering, or installing proper roof support before work is continued or any other work is done or (ii) cause all miners to vacate the place.

C. At least once each shift, or more often if necessary, the mine foreman or other certified person shall examine and test the roof, face, and ribs of each active working section where coal is being produced while one or more miners are working in such section. Any place in which a hazardous condition is found by the mine foreman shall be made safe in his presence or under his direction or all miners shall be withdrawn from such place. Such hazardous condition and corrective actions taken shall be recorded in the on-shift record book at the mine.
