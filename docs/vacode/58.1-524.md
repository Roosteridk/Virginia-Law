Notification to the Department and the furnishing of identifying information must occur on or before a date specified by the Department.

Upon determination by the Department that a debtor specified by the claimant agency qualifies for such a refund, the Department shall notify the claimant agency that a refund is pending, specify its sum, and indicate the debtor's address as listed on the tax return.

C. The Department, upon certification as hereinafter provided in this article, shall set off the certified debt against the refund to which the debtor would otherwise be entitled.
