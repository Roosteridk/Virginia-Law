# § 46.2-341.25 Preliminary analysis of breath of commercial drivers to determine alcohol content of blood.

A. Any person who is reasonably suspected of a violation of § [46.2-341.24](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.24/) or of having any alcohol in his blood while driving or operating a commercial motor vehicle may be required by any law-enforcement officer to provide a sample of such person's breath for a preliminary screening to determine the probable alcohol content of his blood. Such person shall be entitled, upon request, to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. Such breath may be analyzed by any police officer of the Commonwealth, or of any county, city, or town, or by any member of a sheriff's department in the normal discharge of his duties.

B. The Department of Forensic Science shall determine the proper method and equipment to be used in analyzing breath samples taken pursuant to this section and shall advise the respective police and sheriff's departments of the same.

C. If the breath sample analysis indicates that there is alcohol present in the person's blood, or if the person refuses to provide a sample of his breath for a preliminary screening, such person shall then be subject to the provisions of §§ [46.2-341.26:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.26:1/) through [46.2-341.26:11](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.26:11/).

The results of a breath analysis conducted pursuant to this section shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution under § [46.2-341.24](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.24/) or [46.2-341.31](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.31/), but may be used as a basis for charging a person for a violation of the provisions of § [46.2-341.24](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.24/) or [46.2-341.31](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.31/).
