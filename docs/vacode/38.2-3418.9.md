B. Such coverage shall include benefits for a minimum stay in the hospital of not less than 23 hours for a laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and 48 hours for a vaginal hysterectomy. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring the provision of the total hours referenced when the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, determines that a shorter period of hospital stay is appropriate.

C. The requirements of this section shall apply to all insurance policies, contracts and plans delivered, issued for delivery, reissued, or extended on and after July 1, 1999, or at any time thereafter when any term of the policy, contract or plan is changed or any premium adjustment is made.

D. This section shall not apply to short-term travel, accident-only, or limited or specified disease policies or contracts, nor to policies or contracts designed for issuance to persons eligible for coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as Medicare, or any other similar coverage under state or federal governmental plans.
