# § 2.2-2023 Virginia Technology Infrastructure Fund created; contributions.

A. The Virginia Technology Infrastructure Fund (the Fund) is created in the state treasury. The Fund is to be used to fund information technology projects and services or to pay private partners as authorized in subsection C of § [2.2-2007](/vacode/2.2-2007/).

B. The Fund shall consist of: (i) the transfer of general and nongeneral fund appropriations from executive branch agencies which represent savings that accrue from reductions in the cost of information technology and communication services; (ii) the transfer of general and nongeneral fund appropriations from executive branch agencies which represent savings from the implementation of information technology enterprise projects; (iii) funds identified pursuant to subsection C of § [2.2-2007](/vacode/2.2-2007/); (iv) such general and nongeneral fund fees or surcharges as may be assessed to executive branch agencies for enterprise technology projects; (v) gifts, grants, or donations from public or private sources; and (vi) such other funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly. Savings shall be as identified by the CIO through a methodology reviewed by the ITAC and approved by the Secretary of Finance. The Auditor of Public Accounts shall certify the amount of any savings identified by the CIO. For public institutions of higher education, however, savings shall consist only of that portion of total savings that represent general funds. The State Comptroller is authorized to transfer cash consistent with appropriation transfers. Appropriated funds from federal sources are exempted from transfer. Except for funds to pay private partners as authorized in subsection C of § [2.2-2007](/vacode/2.2-2007/), moneys in the Fund shall only be expended as provided by the appropriation act.

Interest earned on the Fund shall be credited to the Fund. The Fund shall be permanent and nonreverting. Any unexpended balance in the Fund at the end of the biennium shall not be transferred to the general fund of the state treasury.
