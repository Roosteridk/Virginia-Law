# § 46.2-393 Suspension of license on conviction of certain reckless offenses; restricted licenses.

A. When any person is convicted of reckless driving as provided in §§ [46.2-853](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-853/) through [46.2-864](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-864/), in addition to any penalties provided by law, the driver's license of the person may be suspended by the court for a period of not less than 60 days nor more than six months. In case of conviction the court shall order the surrender of the license to the court where it shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § [46.2-398](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-398/). If the person so convicted has not obtained a license required by this chapter or is a nonresident, the court shall direct in the judgment of conviction that the person shall not drive any motor vehicle in the Commonwealth for a period of not less than 60 days nor more than six months.

B. The court may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, provide that such person be issued a restricted permit to operate a motor vehicle during the period of suspension for any of the purposes set forth in subsection E of § [18.2-271.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-271.1/). The court shall forward to the Commissioner a copy of its order entered pursuant to this section, which shall specifically enumerate the restrictions imposed and contain such information regarding the person to whom such a permit is issued as is reasonably necessary to identify such person. The court shall also provide a copy of its order to the person who may operate a motor vehicle on the order until receipt from the Commissioner of a restricted license. A copy of such order and, after receipt thereof, the restricted license shall be carried at all times while operating a motor vehicle. Any person who operates a motor vehicle in violation of any restrictions imposed pursuant to this section shall be punished as provided in subsection C of § [46.2-301](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-301/). No restricted license issued pursuant to this section shall permit any person to operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in the Virginia Commercial Driver's License Act (§ [46.2-341.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.1/) et seq.).
