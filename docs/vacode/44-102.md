# ยง 44-102 Commission not to vacate civil office.

Any citizen of the Commonwealth may accept and hold a commission in the Virginia National Guard and receive pay therefrom or a commission in the Virginia Defense Force or armed forces reserve of the United States, without thereby vacating any civil office or position or commission held by him; and the acceptance or holding of any such commission, and receiving pay therefrom shall not constitute such holding of an office of trust and profit under the government of the Commonwealth and of the United States as shall be incompatible with the holding of any civil office, legislative or judicial, or position or commission under the government of the Commonwealth.
