# ยง 28.2-1510 Approval of amended or supplemental inventory.

The Commission shall not approve an amended or supplemental inventory, if such amended or supplemental inventory initially designates a parcel of land as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, until notice of the Commission's intention so to do has been published once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the county where such land is located. Such notice shall specify the time and place of a public hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views. In addition, the Commission shall give written notice of the amended or supplemental inventory, and of the public hearing, to the owner or owners of each parcel so designated, if known, by postpaid mail to the address of the owner as shown in the land records of the circuit court for the county. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate any subsequently filed amended or supplemental inventory because of the inadvertent failure of the Commission to give written notice to any person listed as having an ownership interest in such land in the land records of the circuit court for the county. After the public hearing, the Commission may approve, amend, or disapprove such amended or supplemental inventory.
