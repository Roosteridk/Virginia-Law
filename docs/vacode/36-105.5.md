# ยง 36-105.5 Enforcement of Building Code on Indian reservations.

A. Recognizing the unique relationship between the Commonwealth and certain of its state-recognized Indian tribes, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the Commonwealth nor any locality therein is responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (ยง [36-97](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-97/) et seq.) on any Indian reservation recognized by the Commonwealth whereupon a state-recognized Indian tribe has, by duly enacted tribal ordinance, adopted the Uniform Statewide Building Code and (i) assumed sole responsibility for existing buildings and new construction on the reservation and (ii) for purposes of enforcing the ordinance, retained firms or individuals to function as the building official on such reservation.

B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer or infer responsibility or liability on any party for any action undertaken prior to July 1, 2015.
