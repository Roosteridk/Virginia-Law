# § 46.2-1072 Operation of vehicle without serial or identification number; requirements for stamping, cutting, or embossing numbers; regulations.

It shall be unlawful to sell or to drive on any highway in the Commonwealth any motor vehicle which does not have stamped on or cut into its motor its motor number or which does not bear a permanent serial or other identification number assigned by the manufacturer or by the Commissioner, or any trailer or semitrailer which does not bear a permanent serial or other identification number assigned by its manufacturer or the Commissioner. The number shall be stamped, cut, embossed, or attached in such a manner that it cannot be changed, altered, or removed without plainly showing evidence which would be readily detectable or which would destroy the attached plate. The number shall be die stamped, cut, or embossed into or attached to a permanent part of the vehicle which is easily accessible for verification. However, nonresident owners who are permitted to operate motor vehicles, trailers, or semitrailers without registration, under the registration provision relating to nonresidents contained in §§ [46.2-655](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-655/) through [46.2-661](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-661/) shall not be required to comply with this section before operating a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer on the highways in the Commonwealth.

The Commissioner may adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.
