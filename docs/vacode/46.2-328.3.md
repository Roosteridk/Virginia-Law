A. Upon application of any person who does not meet the requirements for a driver's license or permit under subsection A or B of § [46.2-328.1](/vacode/46.2-328.1/), the Department may issue to the applicant a driver privilege card or permit if the Department determines that the applicant (i) has reported income and deductions from Virginia sources, as defined in § [58.1-302](/vacode/58.1-302/), or been claimed as a dependent, on an individual income tax return filed with the Commonwealth in the preceding 12 months and (ii) is not in violation of the insurance requirements set forth in Article 8 (§ [46.2-705](/vacode/46.2-705/) et seq.) of Chapter 6.

B. Driver privilege cards and permits shall confer the same privileges and shall be subject to the same provisions of this title as driver's licenses and permits issued under this chapter, unless otherwise provided, and shall be subject to the following conditions and exceptions:

1. The front of a driver privilege card or permit shall be identical in appearance to a driver's license or permit that is not a REAL ID credential and the back of the card or permit shall be identical in appearance to the restriction on the back of a limited-duration license, permit, or special identification card;

2. An applicant for a driver privilege card or permit shall not be eligible for a waiver of any part of the driver examination provided under § [46.2-325](/vacode/46.2-325/);

3. An applicant for a driver privilege card or permit shall not be required to present proof of legal presence in the United States;

4. A driver privilege card or permit shall expire on the applicant's second birthday following the date of issuance;

5. The fee for an original driver privilege card or permit shall be $50. The Department may issue, upon application by the holder of a valid, unexpired card or permit issued under this section, and upon payment of a fee of $50, another driver privilege card or permit that shall be valid for a period of two years from the date of issuance. The amount paid by an applicant for a driver privilege card or other document issued pursuant to this chapter shall be considered privileged information for the purposes of § [46.2-208](/vacode/46.2-208/). No applicant shall be required to provide proof of compliance with clauses (i) and (ii) of subsection A for a reissued, renewed, or duplicate card or permit; and

6. Any information collected pursuant to this section that is not otherwise collected by the Department or required for the issuance of any other driving credential issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and any information regarding restrictions in the Department's records related to the issuance of a credential issued pursuant to this section shall be considered privileged. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [46.2-208](/vacode/46.2-208/), such information shall not be released except upon request by the subject of the information, the parent of a minor who is the subject of the information, the guardian of the subject of the information, or the authorized representative of the subject of the information, or pursuant to a court order.

C. The Department shall not release the following information relating to the issuance of a driver privilege card or permit, except upon request by the subject of the information, the parent of a minor who is the subject of the information, the guardian of the subject of the information, or the authorized representative of the subject of the information, or pursuant to a court order, (i) proof documents submitted for the purpose of obtaining a driver privilege card or permit, (ii) the information in the Department's records indicating the type of proof documentation that was provided, or (iii) applications.

The Department shall release only to any federal, state, or local governmental entity, local government group self-insurance pool, law-enforcement officer, attorney for the Commonwealth, or court, or the authorized agent of any of the foregoing, information related to the issuance of a driver privilege card or permit, the release of which is not otherwise prohibited by this section, that is required for a requester to carry out the requester's official functions if the requester provides the individual's name and other sufficient identifying information contained on the individual's record. Any such release shall be in accordance with the requirements of § [46.2-208](/vacode/46.2-208/).
