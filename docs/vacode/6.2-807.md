# § 6.2-807 Discoverability or admissibility of compliance review committee documents.

A. As used in this section, "compliance review committee" means a committee appointed by the board of directors of a bank for the purpose of evaluating and improving the bank's compliance with federal and state laws and adherence to its own established ethical and financial standards, and includes any other person when that person acts in an investigatory capacity at the direction of a compliance review committee.

B. Any records, reports, or other documents created by a compliance review committee are confidential and shall not be discoverable or admissible in evidence in any civil action unless, upon motion, the trial court determines in its discretion that there has been an abuse of the provisions of this section.

C. Any records, reports, or other documents produced by a compliance review committee and delivered to a federal or state governmental agency remain confidential and shall not be discoverable or admissible in evidence in any civil action, except to the extent that applicable law provides that such records, reports or other documents are not protected from disclosure.

D. In no event shall the existence of or any action by a compliance review committee serve as a basis or justification for delay of, or limit upon, the discovery process set forth in state or federal rules.

E. The work product created by any person acting in an investigatory capacity at the direction of a compliance review committee prior to his participation in the work of the compliance review committee or at the direction of the compliance review committee shall be subject to the rules governing discovery in accordance with the Rules of the Virginia Supreme Court.

F. This section shall not be construed to limit the discovery or admissibility:

1. In any civil action of any records, reports or other documents that are not created by a compliance review committee; or

2. Of any factual information which may be reviewed by a compliance review committee.
