# ยง 56-484.7:4 Revocation of Commission approval.

The Commission may revoke its approval of a petition under ยง [56-484.7:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-484.7:1/) no earlier than five years after such approval if it finds (i) that the factors described in ยง [56-484.7:2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-484.7:2/) on which the approval was based no longer exist or are no longer being satisfied, or (ii) that the petitioner has not made satisfactory progress toward making generally available the qualifying communications services specified in the petition. If the Commission finds that such approval should be revoked, it shall determine a date by which the county, city, town, electric commission or board, or authority shall cease to offer such qualifying communications services. In determining such date the Commission shall allow a reasonable time for the entity to offer its equipment, infrastructure and other assets related to such qualifying communications services for sale at fair market value, which shall be deemed to be no less than the amount of the indebtedness, for such equipment, infrastructure and other assets related to such qualifying communications services. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the use of telecommunications equipment and services for intragovernmental purposes as specified in ยง [15.2-1500](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1500/).
