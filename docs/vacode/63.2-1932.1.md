# ยง 63.2-1932.1 Automated administrative enforcement in interstate cases.

A. The Department shall use high-volume automated administrative enforcement, to the same extent as used for intrastate cases, in response to a request made by another state to enforce support orders, and shall promptly report the results of such enforcement procedure to the requesting state. For purposes of this section, "high volume automated administrative enforcement" in interstate cases means, on the request of another state, the identification by the Department, through automated data matches with financial institutions and other entities where assets may be found, of assets owned by persons who owe child support in other states, and the seizure of such assets by the Department through levy or other appropriate processes.

B. The Department may, by electronic or other means, transmit to another state a request for assistance in enforcing child support orders through high-volume automated administrative enforcement. The request shall (i) include such information as will enable the state to which the request is transmitted to compare the information about the cases to the information in the data bases of the state; and (ii) shall constitute a certification by the Department of the amount of support in arrears and of the Department's compliance with all procedural due process requirements applicable to each case.

C. If the Department provides assistance to another state pursuant to this section, neither the Department nor the state shall consider the case to be transferred to the caseload of the other state.

D. The Department shall maintain records of (i) the number of such requests for assistance pursuant to this section; (ii) the number of cases for which the Department collected support in response to such a request; and (iii) the amount of such collected support.
