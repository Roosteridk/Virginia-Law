# ยง 54.1-3442.7 Dispensing cannabis products; report.

A. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall dispense or deliver cannabis products only in person to (i) a patient who is a Virginia resident or temporarily resides in Virginia and has been issued a valid written certification; (ii) such patient's registered agent; or (iii) if such patient is a minor or a vulnerable adult as defined in ยง [18.2-369](/vacode/18.2-369/), such patient's parent or legal guardian who is a Virginia resident or temporarily resides in Virginia. A companion may accompany a patient into a pharmaceutical processor's dispensing area or cannabis dispensing facility. Prior to the initial dispensing of cannabis products pursuant to each written certification, a pharmacist or pharmacy technician employed by the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall make and maintain, on site or remotely by electronic means, for two years a paper or electronic copy of the written certification that provides an exact image of the document that is clearly legible; shall view, in person or by audiovisual means, a current photo identification of the patient, registered agent, parent, or legal guardian; and shall verify current board registration of the practitioner and the corresponding registered agent if applicable. Thereafter, an initial dispensing may be delivered to the patient, registered agent, parent, legal guardian, or designated caregiver facility. Prior to any subsequent dispensing of cannabis products pursuant to each written certification, an employee or delivery agent shall view a current photo identification of the patient, registered agent, parent, or legal guardian and the current board registration issued to the registered agent if applicable. No pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall dispense more than a 90-day supply, as determined by the dispensing pharmacist or certifying practitioner, for any patient during any 90-day period. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may dispense less than a 90-day supply of a cannabis product for any patient during any 90-day period; however, a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may dispense more than one cannabis product to a patient at one time. No more than four ounces of botanical cannabis shall be dispensed for each 30-day period for which botanical cannabis is dispensed. The Board shall establish in regulation an amount of cannabis oil that constitutes a 90-day supply to treat or alleviate the symptoms of a patient's diagnosed condition or disease. In determining the appropriate amount of a cannabis product to be dispensed to a patient, a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall consider all cannabis products dispensed to the patient and adjust the amount dispensed accordingly.

B. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall dispense only cannabis products produced on the premises of a pharmaceutical processor permitted by the Board or cannabis products that have been formulated with extracts from industrial hemp acquired by a pharmaceutical processor from a registered industrial hemp dealer or processor pursuant to ยง [54.1-3442.6](/vacode/54.1-3442.6/). A pharmaceutical processor may begin cultivation upon being issued a permit by the Board.

C. The Board shall report annually by December 1 to the Chairmen of the House Committee for Health, Welfare and Institutions and the Senate Committee on Education and Health on the operation of pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities issued a permit by the Board.

D. The concentration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in any cannabis product on site may be up to 10 percent greater than or less than the level of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol measured for labeling. A pharmaceutical processor and cannabis dispensing facility shall ensure that such concentration in any cannabis product on site is within such range. A pharmaceutical processor producing cannabis products shall establish a stability testing schedule of cannabis products.
