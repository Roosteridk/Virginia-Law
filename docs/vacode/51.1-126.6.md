# § 51.1-126.6 Certain employees of public school divisions.

A. The Board shall establish a defined contribution plan covering any eligible employee serving in a position designated in § [22.1-60](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-60/) who elects to participate in the plan.

B. Any school board established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and Chapter 5 (§ [22.1-28](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-28/) et seq.) of Title 22.1 is hereby authorized to make contributions to the optional retirement plan established by the Virginia Retirement System pursuant to this section for the benefit of its eligible employees who elect to participate in such a plan. Any eligible employee of such school board hired on or after the effective date of the plan shall make an irrevocable election to participate in either (i) the retirement system established by this chapter or (ii) the optional retirement plan established by the Virginia Retirement System pursuant to this section. Such election shall be made in accordance with the guidelines established by the Virginia Retirement System.

C. No employee of any school board who is an active member of the retirement plan established under this section shall also be an active member in the Virginia Retirement System or beneficiary thereof other than as a contingent annuitant. Such eligible employee may, however, be covered under any insurance plan established by the Board under this title for which he would have been otherwise eligible.

D. The contribution by the school board to such employee's defined contribution account shall be determined by the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System in consultation with its actuary. Contributions to the defined contribution account and all earnings thereon shall be credited to an account to be maintained for each eligible employee who elects to participate. Contributions by the school board to an electing employee's defined contribution account shall be in lieu of contributions to the retirement system required pursuant to § [51.1-145](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-145/). In addition, any person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, shall, pursuant to procedures established by the Board, pay member contributions on a salary reduction basis in accordance with § 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, in an amount equal to five percent of his creditable compensation, to the retirement plan established under this section. Each employee making such member contribution shall be deemed to consent and agree to any salary reduction for purposes of the member contribution. Such member contributions shall be in addition to all contributions by the school board to such employee's defined contribution account.

E. If a member of the optional retirement plan maintained under this section is at any time in service as an employee in a position covered for retirement purposes under the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 2 (§ [51.1-200](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-200/) et seq.), Chapter 2.1 (§ [51.1-211](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-211/) et seq.), or Chapter 3 (§ [51.1-300](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-300/) et seq.) of this title, his benefit payments under the optional retirement plan maintained under this section shall be suspended while so employed; provided, however, reemployment in such position shall have no effect on the payment under the optional retirement plan maintained under this section if the benefits are being paid in an annuity form under a lifetime annuity contract purchased with the member's account balance.

F. Effective January 1, 2014, any reference to "retirement system" or "Virginia Retirement System" in this section, as the context requires, shall mean the hybrid retirement program described in § [51.1-169](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-169/). The Virginia Retirement System shall develop policies and procedures for the administration of such plan in accordance with existing and future federal and state policies, regulations, and statutes governing the administration of such plans.
