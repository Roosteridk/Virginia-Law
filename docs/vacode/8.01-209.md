# ยง 8.01-209 Bond for purchase money to have force of judgment.

When any bond taken under ยง [8.01-206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-206/) becomes payable and is returned to the office of the court from which the execution issued, it shall have the force of a judgment against such of the obligors therein as may be then alive. Execution may be issued thereon against them. And the same shall be proceeded under in like manner as an execution issued on such a judgment or decree as is mentioned in ยง [8.01-201](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-201/), save only that the clerk shall endorse "no security is to be taken," and the officer shall govern himself accordingly and sell for ready money any real estate which he may levy on under the same.
