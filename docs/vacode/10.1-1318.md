A. Any owner aggrieved by a final decision of the Department under § [10.1-1309](/vacode/10.1-1309/), § [10.1-1322](/vacode/10.1-1322/) or subsection D of § [10.1-1307](/vacode/10.1-1307/) is entitled to judicial review thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.).

B. Any person who has participated, in person or by submittal of written comments, in the public comment process related to a final decision of the Department under § [10.1-1322](/vacode/10.1-1322/) and who has exhausted all available administrative remedies for review of the Department's decision, shall be entitled to judicial review of the Department's decision in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ [2.2-4000](/vacode/2.2-4000/) et seq.) if such person meets the standard for obtaining judicial review of a case or controversy pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution. A person shall be deemed to meet such standard if (i) such person has suffered an actual or imminent injury which is an invasion of a legally protected interest and which is concrete and particularized; (ii) such injury is fairly traceable to the decision of the Board and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court; and (iii) such injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision by the court.
