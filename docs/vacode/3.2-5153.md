# § 3.2-5153 (For expiration date, see Editor's notes) Judgment as to covered produce to be condemned or destroyed; procedure before an appropriate court; appeal; proceeds.

A. Unless otherwise shown or if the covered produce to be condemned or destroyed pursuant to § [3.2-5151](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-5151/) is found upon trial to be in violation of any provision of 21 C.F.R. Part 112, this chapter, or regulations of the Board adopted pursuant to § [3.2-5148](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-5148/), it shall be the duty of the general district court to render judgment that the covered produce be forfeited to the Commonwealth and that the goods be destroyed or sold by the Commissioner for any purpose other than to be used for food, as defined in § [3.2-5129](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-5129/). The mode of procedure before the general district court shall be the same, as near as may be in civil proceedings. Either party may appeal to the circuit court as appeals are taken from the general district court, but it shall not be necessary for the Commonwealth to give any appeal bond.

B. The proceeds arising from any sale ordered pursuant to subsection A shall be disposed of in accordance with § [19.2-386.14](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.14/).
