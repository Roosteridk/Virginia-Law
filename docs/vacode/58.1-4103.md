# § 58.1-4103 Voluntary exclusion program.

A. The Board shall adopt regulations to establish and implement a voluntary exclusion program.

B. The regulations shall include the following provisions:

1. Except as provided by regulation of the Board, a person who participates in the voluntary exclusion program agrees to refrain from (i) playing any account-based lottery game authorized under the provisions of this chapter or Chapter 40 (§ [58.1-4000](/vacode/58.1-4000/) et seq.); (ii) participating in sports betting as such activity is regulated by the Board; (iii) engaging in any form of casino gaming authorized under the provisions of this chapter; (iv) participating in charitable gaming, as defined in § [18.2-340.16](/vacode/18.2-340.16/); (v) participating in fantasy contests, as defined in § [59.1-556](/vacode/59.1-556/); or (vi) wagering on horse racing, as defined in § [59.1-365](/vacode/59.1-365/). Any state agency, at the request of the Department, shall assist in administering the voluntary exclusion program pursuant to the provisions of this section.

2. A person who participates in the voluntary exclusion program may choose an exclusion period of two years, five years, or lifetime.

3. Except as provided by regulation of the Board, a person who participates in the voluntary exclusion program may not petition the Board for removal from the program for the duration of his exclusion period.

4. The name of a person participating in the program shall be included on a list of excluded persons. The list of persons entering the voluntary exclusion program and the personal information of the participants shall be confidential, with dissemination by the Department limited to lottery sales agents licensed under Chapter 40 (§ [58.1-4000](/vacode/58.1-4000/) et seq.), owners and operators of casino gaming establishments, and any other parties the Department deems necessary for purposes of enforcement. The list and the personal information of participants in the voluntary exclusion program shall not be subject to disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ [2.2-3700](/vacode/2.2-3700/) et seq.). In addition, the Board may disseminate the list to other parties upon request by the participant and agreement by the Board.

5. Lottery sales agents and owners and operators of casino gaming establishments shall make all reasonable attempts as determined by the Board to cease all direct marketing efforts to a person participating in the program. The voluntary exclusion program shall not preclude lottery sales agents and owners and operators of casino gaming establishments from seeking the payment of a debt incurred by a person before entering the program. In addition, the owner or operator of a casino gaming establishment may share the names of individuals who self-exclude across its corporate enterprise, including sharing such information with any of its affiliates.
