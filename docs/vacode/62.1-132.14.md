(3) To simultaneously dredge designated areas not covered by the federal project when and where required;

(4) To construct and maintain public wharves and public roads leading thereto;

(8) To construct and maintain marine railways for the public use; and

(9) To provide or satisfy any other items or conditions of local cooperation as stipulated in the congressional document covering the particular project involved.
