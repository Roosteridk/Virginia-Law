# ยง 2.2-1812 Admissibility of reproductions of checks in evidence; compliance with subpoena.

A. A reproduction of any check or draft or an enlargement of such reproduction drawn by the State Treasurer, when satisfactorily identified, shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence. The introduction of a reproduced check or draft or of an enlargement thereof shall not preclude admission of the original. Any such check or draft, reproduction or enlargement purporting to be sealed, sealed and signed, or signed alone by the State Treasurer or on his behalf by his designee, may be considered satisfactorily identified and admitted as evidence, without any proof of the seal or signature, or of the official character of the person whose name is signed to it.

B. The State Treasurer or his designee, when served with any summons, subpoena, subpoena duces tecum or order, directing him to produce any check or draft kept by or in the possession of any agency or institution of the Commonwealth, may comply by certifying a reproduction or enlargement in accordance with subsection A and mailing the reproduction or enlargement in a sealed envelope to the clerk of court. Upon good cause shown, any court may direct the Treasurer or his designee to appear personally, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
