# § 38.2-3418.17 Coverage for autism spectrum disorder.

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [38.2-3419](/vacode/38.2-3419/) and any other provision of law, each insurer proposing to issue accident and sickness insurance policies providing hospital, medical and surgical, or major medical coverage on an expense-incurred basis; each corporation providing accident and sickness subscription contracts; and each health maintenance organization providing a health care plan for health care services shall, as provided in this section, provide coverage for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and the treatment of autism spectrum disorder, in individuals (i) from January 1, 2012, until January 1, 2016, from age two years through age six years; (ii) from January 1, 2016, until January 1, 2020, from age two years through age 10 years; and (iii) from and after January 1, 2020, of any age, subject to the annual maximum benefit limitation set forth in subsection K and to the provisions of subsection G. If an individual who is being treated for autism spectrum disorder becomes older than the applicable maximum age set forth in the preceding sentence and continues to need treatment, this section does not preclude coverage of treatment and services. In addition to the requirements imposed on health insurance issuers by § [38.2-3436](/vacode/38.2-3436/), an insurer shall not terminate coverage or refuse to deliver, issue, amend, adjust, or renew coverage of an individual solely because the individual is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or has received treatment for autism spectrum disorder.

B. For purposes of this section:

"Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder" means medically necessary assessments, evaluations, or tests to diagnose whether an individual has an autism spectrum disorder.

"Medically necessary" means in accordance with the generally accepted standards of mental disorder or condition care and clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, site, and duration, based upon evidence and reasonably expected to do any of the following: (i) prevent the onset of an illness, condition, injury, or disability; (ii) reduce or ameliorate the physical, mental, or developmental effects of an illness, condition, injury, or disability; or (iii) assist to achieve or maintain maximum functional capacity in performing daily activities, taking into account both the functional capacity of the individual and the functional capacities that are appropriate for individuals of the same age.

The cost of obtaining any review, including an independent review, shall be covered under the policy, contract, or plan.

D. Coverage under this section will not be subject to any visit limits, and shall be neither different nor separate from coverage for any other illness, condition, or disorder for purposes of determining deductibles, lifetime dollar limits, copayment and coinsurance factors, and benefit year maximum for deductibles and copayment and coinsurance factors.

E. Nothing shall preclude the undertaking of usual and customary procedures, including prior authorization, to determine the appropriateness of, and medical necessity for, treatment of autism spectrum disorder under this section, provided that all such appropriateness and medical necessity determinations are made in the same manner as those determinations are made for the treatment of any other illness, condition, or disorder covered by such policy, contract, or plan.

F. The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) short-term travel, accident only, limited, or specified disease policies; (ii) short-term nonrenewable policies of not more than six months' duration; or (iii) policies or contracts designed for issuance to persons eligible for coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as Medicare, or any other similar coverage under state or federal governmental plans.

H. Any coverage required pursuant to this section shall be in addition to the coverage required by § [38.2-3418.5](/vacode/38.2-3418.5/) and other provisions of law. This section shall not be construed as diminishing any coverage required by § [38.2-3412.1](/vacode/38.2-3412.1/). This section shall not be construed as affecting any obligation to provide services to an individual under an individualized family service plan, an individualized education program, or an individualized service plan.

J. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:

1. An insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or a governmental entity providing coverage for such treatment pursuant to subsection I, is exempt from providing coverage for behavioral health treatment required under this section and not covered by the insurer, corporation, health maintenance organization, or governmental entity providing coverage for such treatment pursuant to subsection I as of December 31, 2011, if:

a. An actuary, affiliated with the insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meets the American Academy of Actuaries' professional qualification standards for rendering an actuarial opinion related to health insurance rate making, certifies in writing to the Commissioner of Insurance that:

(1) Based on an analysis to be completed no more frequently than one time per year by each insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or such governmental entity, for the most recent experience period of at least one year's duration, the costs associated with coverage of behavioral health treatment required under this section, and not covered as of December 31, 2011, exceeded one percent of the premiums charged over the experience period by the insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization; and

(2) Those costs solely would lead to an increase in average premiums charged of more than one percent for all insurance policies, subscription contracts, or health care plans commencing on inception or the next renewal date, based on the premium rating methodology and practices the insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or such governmental entity, employs; and

b. The Commissioner approves the certification of the actuary;

2. An exemption allowed under subdivision 1 shall apply for a one-year coverage period following inception or next renewal date of all insurance policies, subscription contracts, or health care plans issued or renewed during the one-year period following the date of the exemption, after which the insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or such governmental entity, shall again provide coverage for behavioral health treatment required under this section;

3. An insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or such governmental entity, may claim an exemption for a subsequent year, but only if the conditions specified in subdivision 1 again are met; and

4. Notwithstanding the exemption allowed under subdivision 1, an insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization, or such a governmental entity, may elect to continue to provide coverage for behavioral health treatment required under this section.

K. Coverage for applied behavior analysis under this section will be subject to an annual maximum benefit of $35,000, unless the insurer, corporation, or health maintenance organization elects to provide coverage in a greater amount.

L. As of January 1, 2014, to the extent that this section requires benefits that exceed the essential health benefits specified under § 1302(b) of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590), as amended (the ACA), the specific benefits that exceed the specified essential health benefits shall not be required of a qualified health plan when the plan is offered in the Commonwealth by a health carrier through a health benefit exchange established under § 1311 of the ACA. Nothing in this subsection shall nullify application of this section to plans offered outside such an exchange.
