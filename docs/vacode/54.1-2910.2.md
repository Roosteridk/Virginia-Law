The Board shall post on any department website available to the public all final orders, together with any associated notices, which imposed disciplinary action against licensees of the Board.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the inspection and copying of records of disciplinary actions to the extent permitted under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ [2.2-3700](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3700/) et seq.) and § [54.1-2400.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2400.2/).
