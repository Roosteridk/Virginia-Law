1. The specific reason or reasons for the adverse underwriting decision, in writing, if that information was not initially furnished in writing pursuant to subdivision 1 of subsection A of this section;

2. The specific items of personal and privileged information that support those reasons, however:

a. The insurance institution or agent shall not be required to furnish specific items of privileged information if it has a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific information available for review by the Commission, that the applicant, policyholder, or individual proposed for coverage has engaged in criminal activity, fraud, material misrepresentation, or material nondisclosure; and

b. Specific items of medical-record information supplied by a medical-care institution or medical professional shall be disclosed either directly to the individual about whom the information relates or to a medical professional designated by the individual and licensed to provide medical care with respect to the condition to which the information relates, whichever the insurance institution or agent prefers; and

3. The names and addresses of the institutional sources that supplied the specific items of information given pursuant to subdivision 2 of subsection B of this section. However, the identity of any medical professional or medical-care institution shall be disclosed either directly to the individual or to the designated medical professional, whichever the insurance institution or agent prefers.

C. The obligations imposed by this section upon an insurance institution or agent may be satisfied by another insurance institution or agent authorized to act on its behalf. However, the insurance institution or agent making an adverse underwriting decision shall remain responsible for compliance with the obligations imposed by this section.

D. When an adverse underwriting decision results solely from an oral request or inquiry, the explanation of reasons and summary of rights required by subsection A of this section may be given orally.
