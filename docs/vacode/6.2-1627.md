# § 6.2-1627 Private actions.

A. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude any person who suffers loss as a result of a violation of Chapter 3 (§ [6.2-300](/vacode/6.2-300/) et seq.) or Chapter 4 (§ [6.2-400](/vacode/6.2-400/) et seq.) from maintaining an action to recover damages or restitution and, as provided by statute, attorney fees. However, in any matter in which the Attorney General has exercised his authority pursuant to § [6.2-1626](/vacode/6.2-1626/), an individual action shall not be maintainable if the individual has received damages or restitution pursuant to § [6.2-1626](/vacode/6.2-1626/).

B. A borrower who suffers a loss as a result of a mortgage broker's breach of duty as set forth in subdivision B 5 of § [6.2-1616](/vacode/6.2-1616/) may bring an action against such broker to recover actual damages. In addition to any damages awarded, such borrower also may be awarded attorney fees and court costs.
