This notice shall not constitute a case decision as defined in § [2.2-4001](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4001/).

B. It shall be the duty of every attorney for the Commonwealth to whom the Commissioner shall report any violation of this chapter to cause proceedings to be prosecuted without delay.

Copies of such warnings shall be reported to the Board.
