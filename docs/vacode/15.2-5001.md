# ยง 15.2-5001 Purpose of chapter.

It is the intent of the legislature by the passage of this chapter to allocate Virginia's total private activity bond issuing authority to those issuing authorities empowered to issue private activity bonds.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes restrictions on the issuance of bonds designated in the Act as "private activity bonds." These restrictions include limitations on the aggregate amount of private activity bonds that may be issued in each state in any calendar year that may be regarded as exempt from federal income taxation. Section 146 (e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provides the authority for each state to establish a system for the allocation of the state ceiling on private activity bonds.

It is the intent of the legislature to provide for the allocation of the state ceiling among issuers of such bonds in a manner which will promote the public purposes and maximize the public benefits created by the issuance of such bonds.
