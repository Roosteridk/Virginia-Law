# ยง 15.2-4812 Enlargement of districts.

A. The district may be enlarged by resolution of the board of supervisors upon the petition of (i) the owners of at least 51 percent of either the assessed value of land or land area, as the case may be, of real property in the district that (a) is unimproved, regardless of zoning, or (b) has been zoned for commercial or industrial use or is used for such purposes in the district and (ii) the owners of at least 51 percent of either the assessed value of land or land area, as the case may be, of real property that is located within the territory sought to be added to the district and that (a) is unimproved, regardless of zoning, or (b) has been zoned for commercial or industrial use or is used for such purposes, provided that any such territory shall be contiguous to the existing district. The petitioners shall present the information required by ยง [15.2-4802](/vacode/15.2-4802/). Upon receipt of such petitions, the county shall use the standards and procedures described in ยง [15.2-4802](/vacode/15.2-4802/), except that residents and owners of both the existing district and the area proposed for the enlargement shall have the right to appear and show cause why any property or properties should not be included in the proposed enlargement of the district.

B. If the board of supervisors finds the enlargement of a district (i) would be in accordance with the applicable county comprehensive plan for the development of the area, (ii) would be in the best interests of the residents and owners of the real property within the proposed district, (iii) would be in furtherance of the public health, safety, and general welfare, and (iv) would not limit or adversely affect the rights and interests of any party that has contracted with the district, the board of supervisors shall pass a resolution providing for the enlargement of the district.

C. Where unimproved property, regardless of zoning, is included in the resolution enlarging the district, the board of supervisors, upon approving the resolution, shall direct that a copy of the resolution be recorded in the land records of the circuit court for the judicial circuit in which that county is located for each parcel of unimproved real property included in the district. For purposes of this section, "parcel" means tax map parcel.
