# § 9.1-907 Procedures upon a failure to register, reregister, or verify registration information.

A. Whenever it appears from the records of the State Police that a person has failed to comply with the duty to register, reregister, or verify his registration information, the State Police shall promptly investigate and, if there is probable cause to believe a violation has occurred, obtain a warrant or assist in obtaining an indictment charging a violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) in the jurisdiction in which the person last registered, reregistered, or verified his registration information or, if the person failed to comply with the duty to register, in the jurisdiction in which the person was last convicted of an offense for which registration or reregistration is required or if the person was convicted of an offense requiring registration outside the Commonwealth, in the jurisdiction in which the person resides. The State Police shall forward to the jurisdiction an affidavit signed by a custodian of the records that such person failed to comply with the duty to register, reregister, or verify his registration information. If such affidavit is admitted into evidence, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of the failure to comply with the duty to register, reregister, or verify his registration information in any trial or hearing for the violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/), provided that in a trial or hearing other than a preliminary hearing, the requirements of subsection G of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the affidavit pursuant to subsection H of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/). The State Police shall also promptly notify the local law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction of the person's last known residence as shown in the records of the State Police.

B. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a law-enforcement officer employed by a sheriff's office or police department of a locality from enforcing the provisions of this chapter, including obtaining a warrant, or assisting in obtaining an indictment for a violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/). The local law-enforcement agency shall notify the State Police forthwith of such actions taken pursuant to this chapter or under the authority granted pursuant to this section.

C. The State Police shall physically verify or cause to be physically verified the registration information within 30 days of the initial registration and semiannually each year thereafter and within 30 days of a change of address of those persons who are not under the control of the Department of Corrections or community supervision as defined by § [53.1-1](/vacode/53.1-1/), who are required to register pursuant to this chapter. Whenever it appears that a person has provided false registration information, the State Police shall promptly investigate and, if there is probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, obtain a warrant or assist in obtaining an indictment charging a violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) in the jurisdiction in which the person last registered, reregistered, or verified his registration information. The State Police shall forward to the jurisdiction an affidavit signed by a custodian of the records that such person failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter. If such affidavit is admitted into evidence, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of the failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter in any trial or hearing for the violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/), provided that in a trial or hearing other than a preliminary hearing, the requirements of subsection G of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the affidavit pursuant to subsection H of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/). The State Police shall also promptly notify the local law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction of the person's last known residence as shown in the records of the State Police.

D. The Department of Corrections or community supervision as defined by § [53.1-1](/vacode/53.1-1/) shall physically verify or cause to be physically verified by the State Police the registration information within 30 days of the original registration and semiannually each year thereafter and within 30 days of a change of address of all persons who are under the control of the Department of Corrections or community supervision, and those who are under supervision pursuant to § [37.2-919](/vacode/37.2-919/), who are required to register pursuant to this chapter. The Department of Corrections or community supervision, upon request, shall provide the State Police the verification information, in an electronic format approved by the State Police, regarding persons under their control who are required to register pursuant to the chapter. Whenever it appears that a person has provided false registration information, the Department of Corrections or community supervision shall promptly notify the State Police, who shall investigate and, if there is probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, obtain a warrant or assist in obtaining an indictment charging a violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) in the jurisdiction in which the person last registered, reregistered, or verified his registration information. The State Police shall forward to the jurisdiction an affidavit signed by a custodian of the records that such person failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter. If such affidavit is admitted into evidence, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of the failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter in any trial or hearing for the violation of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/), provided that in a trial or hearing other than a preliminary hearing, the requirements of subsection G of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/) have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the affidavit pursuant to subsection H of § [18.2-472.1](/vacode/18.2-472.1/).
