At a minimum, the policy shall contain provisions that (i) are designed to prohibit use by division employees and students of the division's computer equipment and communications services for sending, receiving, viewing, or downloading illegal material via the Internet; (ii) seek to prevent access by students to material that the school division deems to be harmful to juveniles as defined in § [18.2-390](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-390/); (iii) select a technology for the division's computers having Internet access to filter or block Internet access through such computers to child pornography as set out in § [18.2-374.1:1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/) and obscenity as defined in § [18.2-372](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-372/); (iv) establish appropriate measures to be taken against persons who violate the policy; and (v) include a component on Internet safety for students that is integrated in a division's instructional program. The policy may include such other terms, conditions, and requirements as deemed appropriate, such as requiring written parental authorization for Internet use by juveniles or differentiating acceptable uses among elementary, middle, and high school students.

Each school division's policy shall be posted on its website in accordance with § [22.1-253.13:7](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-253.13:7/). Additionally, each local school division shall certify compliance with these requirements annually to the Department of Education.
