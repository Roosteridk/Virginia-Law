As used in this chapter or in the declaration and bylaws, unless provided otherwise or unless the context requires a different meaning:

A person "controls" a declarant if the person (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the declarant; (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than 20 percent of the voting interest in the declarant; (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the declarant; or (iv) has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the declarant.

Control does not exist if the powers described in this definition are held solely as security for an obligation and are not exercised.

"Allocated interests" means the common expense liability and the ownership interest and votes in the association allocated to each cooperative interest.

"Association" or "proprietary lessees' association" means the proprietary lessees' association organized under § [55.1-2132](/vacode/55.1-2132/).

"Capital components" means those items, whether or not a part of the common elements, for which the association has the obligation for repair, replacement, or restoration and for which the executive board determines funding is necessary.

"Common elements" means all portions of a cooperative other than the units of such cooperative.

"Common expenses" means any expenditures made by, or financial liabilities of, the association, together with any allocations to reserves.

For purposes of this chapter, a declarant is treated as the owner of any cooperative interests or potential cooperative interests to which allocated interests have been allocated pursuant to § [55.1-2118](/vacode/55.1-2118/) until that cooperative interest has been created and conveyed to another person.

"Declarant" means any person or group of persons acting in concert that (i) as part of a common promotional plan, offers to dispose of its cooperative interest not previously disposed of; (ii) reserves or succeeds to any special declarant right; or (iii) applies for registration of a cooperative under Article 5 (§ [55.1-2173](/vacode/55.1-2173/) et seq.).

"Person" means a natural person, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity.
