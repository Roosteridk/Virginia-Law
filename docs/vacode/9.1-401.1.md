A state police officer who is a participating employee, as defined in § [51.1-1100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1100/), and who incurs a work-related injury in the line of duty, shall receive supplemental short-term disability coverage, pursuant to § [51.1-1121](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1121/), that provides income replacement for 100 percent of the officer's creditable compensation for the first six months and, pursuant to a certification by the Superintendent of State Police, based on a medical evaluation, that the officer is likely to return to service within another six months, up to one calendar year, that the officer is disabled, without regard to the officer's number of months of state service. Except as provided in this section with regard to the rate of income replacement and the duration of supplemental short-term disability coverage, such state police officers shall be eligible for work-related, supplemental short-term disability benefits upon the same terms and conditions that apply to other participating employees pursuant to Article 4 (§ [51.1-1119](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1119/) et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 51.1. Upon the expiration of the one-calendar-year period, such state police officers shall be eligible for supplemental long-term disability benefits as provided in § [51.1-1123](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1123/).
