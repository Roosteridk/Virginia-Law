# ยง 32.1-321.2 Liability for excess benefits or payments obtained without intent to violate this article; recovery of Medical Assistance erroneously paid.

Any person who, without intent to violate this article, obtains benefits or payments under medical assistance to which he is not entitled shall be liable for any excess benefits or payments received. If the recipient knew or reasonably should have known that he was not entitled to the excess benefits, he may also be liable for interest on the amount of the excess benefits or payments at the judgment rate as defined in ยง [6.2-302](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-302/) from the date upon which such person knew or reasonably should have known that he had received excess benefits or payments to the date on which repayment is made to the Commonwealth. No person shall be liable for payment of interest, however, when excess benefits or payments were obtained as a result of errors made solely by the Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Any payment erroneously made on behalf of a recipient or former recipient of medical assistance may be recovered by the Department of Medical Assistance Services from the recipient or the recipient's income, assets or estate unless such property is otherwise exempted by state or federal law or regulation.
