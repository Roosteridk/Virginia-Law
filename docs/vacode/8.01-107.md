# § 8.01-107 Trial by jury of issues made upon rule.

If, upon the return of such rule, any party thereto demand a trial by jury, the court shall order a trial by jury to ascertain what liability, if any, exists against any such special commissioner, receiver, or purchaser, and their sureties; and the court shall enter judgment on the verdict awarded by the jury. New trials may be granted as in other cases; and notwithstanding such rules be awarded and judgment be rendered against part only of the persons liable thereto, the court may award new rules and proceed to judgment against all the parties who are liable thereto. The provisions of this section, and §§ [8.01-105](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-105/) and [8.01-106](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-106/), shall apply to any officers and their sureties, acting under the decree of the court.

Code 1950, § 8-666; 1977, c. 617.
