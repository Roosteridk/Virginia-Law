B. A construction loan that is accompanied by a valid and binding agreement to advance an amount equal to or greater than the construction loan upon the completion of the building or improvement, which agreement is entered into by an individual or entity acceptable to the bank or the bank itself, whether or not secured by a mortgage or similar lien on the real estate upon which the building or improvement is being constructed, shall not be considered as a loan secured by real estate within the meaning of § [6.2-878](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-878/), but shall be classed as an ordinary commercial loan, unless the terms of the transaction shall be more favorable than in the absence of a lien, in which case an appraisal shall be required as provided under § [6.2-878](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-878/).

C. No bank shall invest in, or be liable in, construction loans in an aggregate amount in excess of 100 percent of its capital and surplus, except that any such loans supported by an executed agreement for permanent financing shall not be included in such aggregate amount.
