# § 8.9A-408 Restrictions on assignment of promissory notes, health-care-insurance receivables, and certain general intangibles ineffective.

(a) Term restricting assignment generally ineffective. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or a general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise, and which term prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to, the assignment or transfer of, or creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in, the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, is ineffective to the extent that the term:

(1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or

(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

(b) Applicability of subsection (a) to sales of certain rights to payment. Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under § [8.9A-610](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-610/) or an acceptance of collateral under § [8.9A-620](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-620/).

(c) Legal restrictions on assignment generally ineffective. A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation:

(1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or

(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

(d) Limitation on ineffectiveness under subsections (a) and (c). To the extent that a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or general intangible or a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (c) would be effective under law other than this title but is ineffective under subsection (a) or (c), the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible:

(1) is not enforceable against the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;

(2) does not impose a duty or obligation on the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;

(3) does not require the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or performance from the secured party;

(4) does not entitle the secured party to use or assign the debtor's rights under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including any related information or materials furnished to the debtor in the transaction giving rise to the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible;

(5) does not entitle the secured party to use, assign, possess, or have access to any trade secrets or confidential information of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; and

(6) does not entitle the secured party to enforce the security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

(e) Inapplicability of subsection (a) to certain payment intangibles. Subsection (a) does not apply to:

(1) the sale of a claim or right to receive compensation for injuries or sickness as described in 26 U.S.C. § 104 (a) (2), as amended from time to time, provided that no inference shall be drawn regarding the enforceability or nonenforceability under other law or any term in an agreement which prohibits, restricts, or requires consent to the sale of such claim or right described in 26 U.S.C. § 104 (a) (2);

(2) a claim or right to receive compensation for injuries or sickness as described in 26 U.S.C. § 104 (a) (1), as amended from time to time; or

(3) a claim or right to receive benefits under a special needs trust as described in 42 U.S.C. § 1396p (d) (4), as amended from time to time.

(f) Inapplicability of subsection (c) to certain payment intangibles. Subsection (c) does not apply to:

(1) a claim or right to receive compensation for injuries or sickness as described in 26 U.S.C. § 104 (a) (1) or (2), as amended from time to time; or

(2) a claim or right to receive benefits under a special needs trust as described in 42 U.S.C. § 1396p (d) (4), as amended from time to time.

(g) Inapplicability to partnership and limited liability company interests. This section does not apply to an interest in a partnership or limited liability company.
