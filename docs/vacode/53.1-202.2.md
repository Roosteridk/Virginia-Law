# § 53.1-202.2 Eligibility for earned sentence credits.

A. Every person who is convicted of a felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, and who is sentenced to serve a term of incarceration in a state or local correctional facility shall be eligible to earn sentence credits in the manner prescribed by this article. Such eligibility shall commence upon the person's incarceration in any correctional facility following entry of a final order of conviction by the committing court. As used in this chapter, "sentence credit" and "earned sentence credit" mean deductions from a person's term of confinement earned through adherence to rules prescribed pursuant to § [53.1-25](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-25/), through program participation as required by §§ [53.1-32.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-32.1/) and [53.1-202.3](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/53.1-202.3/), and by meeting such other requirements as may be established by law or regulation. One earned sentence credit shall equal a deduction of one day from a person's term of incarceration.

B. A juvenile convicted as an adult and sentenced as a serious juvenile offender under clause (i) of subdivision A 1 of § [16.1-272](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-272/) shall be eligible to earn sentence credits for the portion of the sentence served with the Department of Juvenile Justice in the manner prescribed by this article. Consideration for earned sentence credits shall require adherence to the facility's rules and the juvenile's progress toward treatment goals and objectives while sentenced as a serious juvenile offender under § [16.1-285.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-285.1/).
