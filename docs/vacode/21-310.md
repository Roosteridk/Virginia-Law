# ยง 21-310 Guardian ad litem for infants and incapacitated adults.

These proceedings shall not be stayed because of infancy or incapacity; but the court in which the petition was filed shall appoint some discreet and competent attorney at law as guardian ad litem to any infant or incapacitated person who may own or be interested in any of the land affected by these proceedings, whether such persons have been served with process or not. If no such attorney is found willing to act, the court shall appoint some other discreet and proper person as guardian ad litem, but the person so appointed shall not be liable to costs. Every guardian ad litem shall faithfully represent the interest or estate of the infant or incapacitated person for whom he is appointed, and it shall be the duty of the court to see that the estate of such defendant is so represented and protected. Wherever the court is of opinion that the interests of any infant or incapacitated person require, it shall remove any guardian ad litem and appoint another in his stead.
