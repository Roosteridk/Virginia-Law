# § 16.1-357 Disposition when juvenile found incompetent.

A. Upon finding pursuant to subsection F of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/) that the juvenile is incompetent, the court shall order that the juvenile receive services to restore his competency in either a nonsecure community setting or a secure facility as defined in § [16.1-228](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-228/). A copy of the order shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, who shall arrange for the provision of restoration services in a manner consistent with the order. Any report submitted pursuant to subsection E of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/) shall be made available to the agent providing restoration.

B. If the court finds the juvenile incompetent but restorable to competency in the foreseeable future, it shall order restoration services for up to three months. At the end of three months from the date restoration is ordered under subsection A of this section, if the juvenile remains incompetent in the opinion of the agent providing restoration, the agent shall so notify the court and make recommendations concerning disposition of the juvenile. The court shall hold a hearing according to the procedures specified in subsection F of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/) and, if it finds the juvenile unrestorably incompetent, shall order one of the dispositions pursuant to § [16.1-358](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-358/). If the court finds the juvenile incompetent but restorable to competency, it may order continued restoration services for additional three-month periods, provided a hearing pursuant to subsection F of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/) is held at the completion of each such period and the juvenile continues to be incompetent but restorable to competency in the foreseeable future.

C. If, at any time after the juvenile is ordered to undergo services under subsection A of this section, the agent providing restoration believes the juvenile's competency is restored, the agent shall immediately send a report to the court as prescribed in subsection E of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/). The court shall make a ruling on the juvenile's competency according to the procedures specified in subsection F of § [16.1-356](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-356/).
