# § 55.1-1823 Designation of authorized representative.

Except as expressly authorized in this chapter or in the declaration or as otherwise provided by law, no property owners' association shall require any lot owner to execute a formal power of attorney if the lot owner designates a person licensed under the provisions of § [54.1-2106.1](/vacode/54.1-2106.1/) as the lot owner's authorized representative, and the association shall recognize such representation without a formal power of attorney, provided that the association is given a written authorization that includes the designated representative's name, contact information, and license number and the lot owner's signature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of § [13.1-849](/vacode/13.1-849/) of the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ [13.1-801](/vacode/13.1-801/) et seq.) and the association's declaration, bylaws, and articles of incorporation shall be satisfied before any such representative may exercise a vote on behalf of a lot owner as a proxy.
