# ยง 20-146.25 Temporary visitation.

A. A court of this Commonwealth that does not have jurisdiction to modify a child custody determination may issue a temporary order enforcing:

1. A visitation schedule made by a court of another state; or

2. The visitation provisions of a child custody determination of another state that does not provide for a specific visitation schedule.

B. If a court of this Commonwealth makes an order under subdivision A 2, it shall specify in the order a period that it considers adequate to allow the petitioner to obtain an order from a court having jurisdiction under the criteria specified in Article 2 (ยง [20-146.12](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-146.12/) et seq.) of this chapter.
