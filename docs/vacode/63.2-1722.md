A. The Commissioner may revoke or deny renewal of a license of a child welfare agency, assisted living facility, or adult day care center and a child-placing agency may revoke the approval of a foster home if the assisted living facility, adult day care center, child welfare agency, or foster home has knowledge that a person specified in § [63.2-1720](/vacode/63.2-1720/) or [63.2-1721](/vacode/63.2-1721/) required to have a background check (i) has been convicted of any barrier crime as defined in § [19.2-392.02](/vacode/19.2-392.02/) or (ii) in the case of a child welfare agency or foster home, is the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect within or outside the Commonwealth, and such person has not been granted a waiver by the Commissioner pursuant to § [63.2-1723](/vacode/63.2-1723/) or is not subject to the exceptions in subsection B of § [63.2-1720](/vacode/63.2-1720/) or subsection E, F, G, or H of § [63.2-1721](/vacode/63.2-1721/), and the facility, center, or agency refuses to separate such person from employment or service or allows the household member to continue to reside in the home.

B. Failure to obtain background checks pursuant to §§ [63.2-1720](/vacode/63.2-1720/) and [63.2-1721](/vacode/63.2-1721/) shall be grounds for denial, revocation, or termination of a license, registration, or approval or any contract with the Department or a local department to provide child care services to clients of the Department or local department. No violation shall occur if the assisted living facility, adult day care center, child-placing agency, or independent foster home has applied for the background check timely and it has not been obtained due to administrative delay. The provisions of this section shall be enforced by the Department.
