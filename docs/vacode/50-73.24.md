2. Consulting with and advising a general partner with respect to the business of the limited partnership;

3. Acting as surety for the limited partnership or guaranteeing or assuming one or more specific obligations of the limited partnership;

a. The dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership;

7. Winding up the limited partnership pursuant to ยง [50-73.51](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.51/); or

8. Exercising any right or power permitted to limited partners under this chapter and not specifically enumerated in this subsection.

C. The enumeration in subsection B does not mean that the possession or exercise of any other powers by a limited partner constitutes participation by him in the business of the limited partnership.

D. A limited partner who knowingly permits his name to be used in the name of the limited partnership, except under circumstances permitted by subdivision B 1 of ยง [50-73.2](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.2/), is liable to creditors who extend credit to the limited partnership without actual knowledge that the limited partner is not a general partner.
