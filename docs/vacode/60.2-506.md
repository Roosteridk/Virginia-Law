3. Treat each of its instrumentalities as an individual employer.

4. The option described herein shall be exercised by the Governor.

B. If the option contained in subdivision 1 of subsection A of this section is exercised, the Commonwealth may elect to finance benefits to its employees by either taxes, as set forth in §§ [60.2-526](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-526/) through [60.2-533](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-533/), or payments in lieu of taxes.
