# ยง 15.2-4713 Enlargement of local districts.

A. The district shall be enlarged by a resolution of the governing body of the locality upon the joint petition of the commission and the owners of at least 51 percent of either the land area or assessed value of land of the district within the locality and of at least 51 percent of either the land area or assessed value of land located within the territory sought to be added to the district; however, any such territory shall be contiguous to the existing district. The joint petition shall present the information required by subsection A of ยง [15.2-4702](/vacode/15.2-4702/). Upon receipt of such a petition, the locality shall use the standards and procedures provided in subsections B and C of ยง [15.2-4702](/vacode/15.2-4702/); however, the residents and owners of both the existing district and the area proposed for the enlargement shall have the right to appear and show cause why any property should not be included in the proposed district.

B. If the governing body finds the enlargement of the district would be in accordance with the applicable comprehensive plan for the development of the area, in the best interests of the residents and owners of the property within the proposed district, and in furtherance of the public health, safety, and general welfare, and if the governing body finds that enlargement of the district does not limit or adversely affect the rights and interests of any party that has contracted with the district, the governing body of the locality may, at its option, pass a resolution providing for the enlargement of the district.
