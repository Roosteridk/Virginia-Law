# ยง 55.1-2160 Purchaser's right to cancel.

A. A person required to deliver a public offering statement pursuant to subsection C of ยง [55.1-2154](/vacode/55.1-2154/) shall provide a purchaser with a copy of the public offering statement and all amendments to the public offering statement before conveyance of that cooperative interest and not later than the date of any contract of sale. The purchaser may cancel the contract within 10 days after signing the contract.

B. If a purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to subsection A, he may do so by hand delivering notice of such cancellation to the offeror or by mailing notice of such cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the offeror or to his agent for service of process. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by the purchaser before cancellation shall be refunded promptly.

C. If a person required to deliver a public offering statement pursuant to subsection C of ยง [55.1-2154](/vacode/55.1-2154/) fails to provide to a purchaser to whom a cooperative interest is conveyed that public offering statement and all amendments as required by subsection A, the purchaser, in addition to any rights to damages or other relief, is entitled to receive from that person an amount equal to 10 percent of the sales price of the cooperative interest, plus 10 percent of the share, proportionate to his common expense liability, of the indebtedness of the association secured by mortgages or deeds of trust encumbering the cooperative. Execution of a purchase agreement for a cooperative interest that makes reference to the public offering statement and in which the purchaser acknowledges receipt of the public offering statement shall be sufficient proof that the declarant has fully satisfied this requirement.
