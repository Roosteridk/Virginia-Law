# § 38.2-3545 Further restrictions as to beneficiaries.

Within the permitted classes of beneficiaries prescribed in § [38.2-3544](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3544/), the issuing insurer may designate the classes of beneficiaries. No change of beneficiary shall be made by assignment, will, or otherwise to any person outside the designated classes without the consent of the insurer. If no person within the classes of beneficiaries prescribed in § [38.2-3544](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3544/) survives the insured, the insurer may discharge its liability by payment of the proceeds of the policy to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to the proceeds because of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention or burial of the insured.
