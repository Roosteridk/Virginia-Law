# ยง 33.2-1816 Police powers; violations of law.

A. All police officers of the Commonwealth and of each affected locality or public entity shall have the same powers and jurisdiction within the limits of such qualifying transportation facility as they have in their respective areas of jurisdiction, and such police officers shall have access to the qualifying transportation facility at any time for the purpose of exercising such powers and jurisdiction. This authority does not extend to the private offices, buildings, garages, and other improvements of the private entity to any greater degree than the police power extends to any other private buildings and improvements.

B. To the extent the transportation facility is a road, bridge, tunnel, overpass, or similar transportation facility for motor vehicles, the traffic and motor vehicle laws of the Commonwealth or, if applicable, any locality or public entity shall be the same as those applying to conduct on similar transportation facilities in the Commonwealth or such locality or public entity. Punishment for offenses shall be as prescribed by law for conduct occurring on similar transportation facilities in the Commonwealth or such locality or public entity.
