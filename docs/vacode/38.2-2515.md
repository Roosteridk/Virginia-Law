Upon receipt of that notice, or upon information from any source that the membership of the insurer is less than 100, the Commission may revoke the insurer's license, or may issue an order requiring the insurer to increase its membership to at least 100 within a designated period not exceeding 90 days.

If at the expiration of the designated period the membership has not been increased to at least 100, the Commission shall revoke the insurer's license. Upon the revocation of its license as authorized in this section, delinquency proceedings against the insurer may be instituted and conducted as provided in Chapter 15 of this title.
