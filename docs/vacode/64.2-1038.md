# § 64.2-1038 Fiduciary's power to adjust.

A. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a trust or this section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval, may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power to adjust will assist the fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially.

B. This section does not create a duty to exercise or consider the power to adjust under subsection A or to inform a beneficiary about the applicability of this section.

C. A fiduciary that in good faith exercises or fails to exercise the power to adjust under subsection A is not liable to a person affected by the exercise or failure to exercise.

D. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust under subsection A, a fiduciary shall consider all factors the fiduciary considers relevant, including relevant factors in subsection E of § [64.2-1036](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1036/) and the application of subsection I of § [64.2-1048](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1048/) and §§ [64.2-1055](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1055/) and [64.2-1060](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title64.2/chapter10.1/section64.2-1060/).

1. The adjustment or determination would reduce the amount payable to a current income beneficiary from a trust that qualifies for a special tax benefit, except to the extent the adjustment is made to provide for a reasonable apportionment of the total return of the trust between the current income beneficiary and successor beneficiaries;

2. The adjustment or determination would change the amount payable to a beneficiary, as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets, under the terms of the trust;

3. The adjustment or determination would reduce an amount that is permanently set aside for a charitable purpose under the terms of the trust, unless both income and principal are set aside for the charitable purpose;

4. Possessing or exercising the power would cause a person to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for federal income tax purposes;

5. Possessing or exercising the power would cause all or part of the value of the trust assets to be included in the gross estate of an individual for federal estate tax purposes;

6. Possessing or exercising the power would cause an individual to be treated as making a gift for federal gift tax purposes;

7. The fiduciary is not an independent person;

8. The trust is irrevocable and provides for income to be paid to the settlor and possessing or exercising the power would cause the adjusted principal or income to be considered an available resource or available income under a public-benefit program; or

G. A fiduciary may release or delegate to a co-fiduciary the power to adjust under subsection A if the fiduciary determines that the fiduciary's possession or exercise of the power will or may:
