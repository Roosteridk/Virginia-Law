Any such locality may also appropriate its own money for the same purposes for which federal funds may be employed under the provisions of such federal legislation as well as for the purpose of increasing the payments to eligible families or eligible persons beyond federally approved levels when the fair market rent of the rental unit is greater than that established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
