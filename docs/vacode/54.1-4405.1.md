A. There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund (except as set forth in subsection B), to be known as the Board of Accountancy Trust Account (the Trust Account). The purpose of the Trust Account is to provide a supplemental source of funds to the Board on a timely basis for (i) its use in the study, research, investigation, or adjudication of matters involving possible violations of the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated by the Board or (ii) any other purpose that the Board determines is germane to its statutory purposes and cannot otherwise be funded through the Fund. The Trust Account shall consist of transfers from time to time by the Board from the Fund and earnings on the Trust Account.

B. All disbursements from the Trust Account shall be made by the State Treasurer upon warrants of the Comptroller issued upon vouchers signed by an authorized officer of the Board or the Executive Director as authorized by the Board. Funds remaining in the Trust Account at the end of a biennium shall continue to remain in the Trust Account and accrue earnings. Upon a determination by the Board that the Trust Account balance exceeds the amount needed for the purposes set forth in subsection A, the Board may transfer the excess to the Fund.
