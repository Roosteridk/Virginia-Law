# § 28.2-1207 Authority to approve permits for encroachment on subaqueous beds; notice.

A. Any application for a permit to trespass upon or over or encroach upon subaqueous beds which are the Commonwealth's property may be approved by the Commissioner or his authorized representative if the application meets the requirements of §§ [28.2-1205](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1205/) and [28.2-1206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1206/) and the following criteria are satisfied:

1. The total value of the project does not exceed $500,000;

2. The application is not protested by any citizen or objected to by any state agency; and

3. The project for which the permit is sought will not require any other permit from the Commission.

B. If the permit application is for a shore erosion control project recommended by the soil and water conservation district in which the project is to be located and the criteria listed in subsection A of this section are satisfied, the Commission may, after giving notice of the application to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, approve the application without giving notice to or awaiting the approval of any other state agency.

C. The Commission shall, in conjunction with affected state and federal agencies, develop an expedited process for issuing general permits for activities that are intended to improve water quality such as bioengineered streambank projects and livestock stream crossings, and for activities required during emergencies in which a determination has been made that there is a threat to public or private property, or to the health and safety of the public. The development of the general permit shall be exempt from Article 2 (§ [2.2-4006](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4006/) et seq.) of the Administrative Process Act.

D. The Commission shall, in conjunction with affected state and federal agencies, develop an expedited process for issuing a permit for emergency activities intended to restore sand to any publicly owned beach damaged by sand erosion. Such erosion shall have been caused by a discrete, identifiable weather event or sequence of events that threatened public or private property or public health and safety and was the subject of a declaration of emergency by the Governor or the governing body of the locality in which the project is located. The development of the permit shall be exempt from Article 2 (§ [2.2-4006](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4006/) et seq.) of the Administrative Process Act.
