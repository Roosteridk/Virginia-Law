Funding for the costs of expenses of the members shall be provided by the Department of Taxation. The Department of Taxation shall provide staff support. A majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. Meetings of the Board shall be held upon the call of the chairman or whenever a majority of the members so request.

Legislative members appointed shall serve terms coincident with their terms of office and nonlegislative citizen members shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor. All members shall be citizens of the Commonwealth. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments. Members shall not receive compensation for their services, but shall be reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses for the performance of their duties as provided in §§ [2.2-2813](/vacode/2.2-2813/) and [2.2-2825](/vacode/2.2-2825/).
