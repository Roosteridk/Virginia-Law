# ยง 55.1-2181 Annual report and amendments.

A. A declarant, within 30 days after the anniversary date of the order of registration, shall file annually a report to bring up to date the material contained in the application for registration and the public offering statement. This provision does not relieve the declarant of the obligation to file amendments pursuant to subsection B.

B. A declarant shall file promptly amendments to the public offering statement with the Common Interest Community Board.

C. If an annual report reveals that a declarant owns or controls cooperative interests representing less than 25 percent of the voting power in the association and that a declarant has no power to increase the number of units in the cooperative or to cause a merger or confederation of the cooperative with other cooperatives, the Common Interest Community Board shall issue an order relieving the declarant of any further obligation to file annual reports. After such order is issued, so long as the declarant is offering any cooperative interests for sale, the Common Interest Community Board has jurisdiction over the declarant's activities but has no other authority to regulate the cooperative.
