# § 23.1-1006 Management agreement; contents and scope.

A. Each covered institution that complies with the requirements of this article shall have the powers set forth in this article that are expressly included in the management agreement.

B. Each management agreement shall include:

1. A copy of the governing board's resolution in support of a request for restructured operational authority;

2. The institution's express agreement to reimburse the Commonwealth for any additional costs that the Commonwealth incurs to provide health or other group insurance benefits to employees and undertake any risk management program that are attributable to the institution's exercise of restructured operational authority;

3. The institution's undergraduate Virginia student enrollment, financial aid requirements and capabilities, and tuition policy for undergraduate Virginia students; and

4. A statement of the Governor's power to void the management agreement pursuant to subsection E of § [23.1-1007](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-1007/).

C. There is a presumption that restructured operational authority is not included in the management agreement, and such authority shall only be granted to a covered institution if it is expressly included in the management agreement. The only implied authority that is granted to a covered institution is that which is necessary to carry out the express grant of restructured operational authority. Each covered institution shall be governed and administered in the manner provided in (i) this article but subject to the expressed terms of the management agreement, (ii) the general appropriation act, and (iii) the institution's enabling statutes.

D. Except as specifically made inapplicable under this article or the express terms of a management agreement, the provisions of Title 2.2 relating generally to the operation, management, supervision, regulation, and control of public institutions of higher education are applicable to covered institutions as provided by the express terms of the management agreement.

E. In the event of a conflict between any provision of Title 2.2 and any provision of the management agreement, the provisions of the management agreement control. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this article and an institution's enabling statutes, the enabling statutes control.

F. The provisions of the State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act (§ [2.2-3100](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3100/) et seq.) that are applicable to officers and employees of a state governmental agency shall continue to apply to the members of the governing board and the covered employees of a covered institution.

G. A covered institution, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, and the members of its governing board are entitled to the same sovereign immunity to which they would be entitled if the institution were not governed by this article.

H. The Virginia Tort Claims Act (§ [8.01-195.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-195.1/) et seq.) and its limitations on recoveries remain applicable to covered institutions.

I. A management agreement with a public institution of higher education shall not grant restructured operational authority to the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service and Agricultural Experiment Station Division, the University of Virginia's College at Wise, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, or an affiliated entity of the institution unless the intent to grant such authority and the degree to which such authority is granted is expressly included in the management agreement.

K. State government-owned or operated and state-owned teaching hospitals that are a part of a covered institution as of the effective date of the covered institution's initial management agreement shall continue to be characterized as state government-owned or operated and state-owned teaching hospitals for purposes of payments under the state plan for medical assistance services adopted pursuant to § [32.1-325](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-325/), provided that the covered institution commits to serve indigent and medically indigent patients. If such covered institution commits to serve indigent and medically indigent patients, the Commonwealth, through the Department of Medical Assistance Services, shall, subject to the appropriation in the current general appropriation act, continue to reimburse the full cost of the provision of care, treatment, health-related services, and educational services to indigent and medically indigent patients and continue to treat hospitals that were part of a covered institution and that were Type One Hospitals prior to the effective date of the covered institution's initial management agreement as Type One Hospitals for purposes of such reimbursement.

L. Consistent with the terms of the management agreement, the governing board of each covered institution shall assume full responsibility for management of the institution, subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this article and the management agreement, and shall be fully accountable for meeting the requirements of §§ [23.1-206](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-206/), [23.1-306](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-306/), and [23.1-310](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-310/) and such other provisions as may be set forth in the management agreement.
