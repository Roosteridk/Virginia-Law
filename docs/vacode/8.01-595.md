# ยง 8.01-595 Preparation of list of creditors; notice to them.

When a receiver has been appointed he shall immediately prepare or cause to be prepared a list of all creditors, lien and general, of the person, firm, corporation or of any other legal or commercial entity for which he is a receiver; and the court may by proper order compel any defendant for whom a receiver is appointed, or any officer of the corporation or of any other legal or commercial entity for whom the receiver is appointed, to furnish or deliver to the receiver a list, duly sworn to, of all creditors, lien or general, together with their addresses if known. The receiver shall then promptly notify by mail each creditor whose name and address has been ascertained of the appointment of the receiver.

When a permanent receiver is appointed he shall not be required to make a new list of creditors if a temporary receiver or a prior receiver appointed in the same proceedings has already prepared one which is adequate, nor shall he be required to mail other notices to creditors if the prior receiver has given proper notice to the parties entitled thereto.
