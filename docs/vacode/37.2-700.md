A. The Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Board and the Governor, shall determine the necessity for and select the site of any new state facility and any land to be taken or purchased by the Commonwealth for the purposes of any new or existing state facility. The Commissioner shall have charge of the construction of any new building at any state facility, shall determine the design of the building, and may employ architects and other experts or hold competitions for plans and designs for this purpose. If any land or property is taken or purchased by the Board, title shall be taken in the name of the Commonwealth.

B. If any building standing on property under the supervision and control of the Department is in such a state of dilapidation or disrepair that it is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, dangerous to individuals receiving services, employees of the Department, or other persons frequenting that property, the Commissioner may, with the approval of the Board and the Governor, cause the building to be torn down or razed. For this purpose, the Commissioner may contract with any person on the terms that he deems expedient and may sell or otherwise dispose of the materials composing the building.
