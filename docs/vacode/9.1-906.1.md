# § 9.1-906.1 Emergency shelters; notification; registration.

Any person required to register or reregister who enters any place or facility that is designated by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof as an emergency shelter and operated in response to a state or local emergency declared pursuant to Chapter 3.2 (§ [44-146.13](/vacode/44-146.13/) et seq.) of Title 44 shall, as soon as practicable after entry, notify a member of the emergency shelter's staff who is responsible for providing security at the emergency shelter that such person is a registered sex offender. The use of such Registry information pursuant to this section does not constitute a violation of § [9.1-918](/vacode/9.1-918/). No person shall be denied entry into an emergency shelter solely on the basis of his status as a registered sex offender unless such entry is otherwise prohibited by law.
