# § 57-11 Suits by and against trustees.

Such trustees, and such as are mentioned in §§ [57-21](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-21/), [57-22](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-22/), and [57-23](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/57-23/), may, in their own names, sue for and recover any real or personal estate held by them respectively in trust, or damages for injury thereto, and be sued in relation to the same. Such suit notwithstanding the death of any of the trustees, or the appointment of others, shall proceed in the names of the trustees by or against whom it was instituted.

In any case where such trustees shall have given any deed of trust, or encumbered such real or personal estate in any manner to secure any debt, and such trustees have since died, and such church diocese, religious congregation or organization has become extinct, or has ceased to occupy the property, so that it may be regarded as abandoned property, the beneficiary entitled to the debt secured by such deed of trust or encumbrance, may for the purpose of subjecting the estate to the payment of such lien, institute a suit in equity in the circuit court of the county or city in which the property or the greater part thereof is, against the members of such church diocese or religious congregation or organization as parties unknown, proceeding by order of publication as provided by Chapter 8 (§ [8.01-285](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-285/) et seq.) of Title 8.01.

Code 1919, § 42; 1918, p. 409; 1920, p. 9; 1962, c. 516; 2005, c. [772](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0772).
