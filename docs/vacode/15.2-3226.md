# § 15.2-3226 Redistricting and elections in city or town following annexation; registration and transfer of registration of voters in annexed territory.

A. Whenever the boundaries of a city or town, which elects its council by wards or districts, have been expanded through annexation, subject to the provisions of § [24.2-304.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-304.1/), the council of the city or town shall redistrict the municipality into wards or districts, change the boundaries of existing wards or districts, or increase or diminish the number of wards or districts to incorporate the additional territory.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of § [24.2-312](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-312/), there shall be an election for members of council on the first Tuesday in May following the effective date of annexation for terms to commence on July 1 following the election; however, upon the approval of the governing bodies affected and the special court, such election may be on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November following the effective date of annexation for terms to commence on January 1 following the election. If council members are chosen on an at-large basis the election shall be held for the unexpired portion of the term of each council member whose term extends beyond July 1 immediately following the effective date of annexation. If council members are chosen on a ward basis, the election shall be held for each ward affected by the annexation. However, no such election shall be held as a result of an annexation instituted under § [15.2-3202](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3202/) or § [15.2-3203](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-3203/), unless the city or town increases its population by more than five percent due to the annexation.

C. The registration records of voters residing in the annexed areas shall be transferred, and the appropriate notice given, in accordance with § [24.2-114](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-114/). Any person residing in the annexed territory who has not registered shall be entitled to register and vote in the city or town if he would have been entitled to register and vote at the next election of the county.
