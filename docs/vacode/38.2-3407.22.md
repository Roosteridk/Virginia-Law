"Carrier" also includes any health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage, as defined in § [38.2-3431](/vacode/38.2-3431/).

"Enrollee" means any person entitled to health care services from a carrier.

"Health care services" means items or services furnished to any individual for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing, or healing human illness, injury, or physical disability.

"Health plan" means any individual or group health care plan, subscription contract, evidence of coverage, certificate, health services plan, medical or hospital services plan, accident or sickness insurance policy or certificate, managed care health insurance plan, or other similar certificate, policy, contract, or arrangement, and any endorsement or rider thereto, to cover all or a portion of the cost of persons receiving covered health care services, that is subject to state regulation and that is required to be offered, arranged, or issued in the Commonwealth by a carrier licensed under this title.
