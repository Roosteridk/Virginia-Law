# § 3.2-5141 General duty of attorneys for the Commonwealth; compensation.

Whenever a violation of any laws governing the manufacture and preparation for sale, storage, and sale of articles used as food or condiment by human beings or animals, commonly known as the "pure food" and "feeding stuffs laws," is reported by the Commissioner to any attorney for the Commonwealth it shall be the duty of the attorney for the Commonwealth to commence proceedings and prosecute without delay for the fines and penalties in cases prescribed and upon the termination of such proceedings to report in detail to the Commissioner, the results.

For every conviction in any case instituted by any attorney for the Commonwealth upon the complaint of the Commissioner, the attorney for the Commonwealth prosecuting any such case, after he has reported the results to the Commissioner, shall be entitled to a fee of $10 that shall be taxed as a part of the costs in the case, as costs are taxed in other criminal cases, and execution issued therefor against the defendant; and the fee shall be paid notwithstanding any law to the contrary limiting or prescribing the compensation and fees of attorneys for the Commonwealth.

In any case of a sale or delivery of goods in violation of the provisions of the pure food or feeding stuffs laws, the person making such sale or delivery, may be prosecuted either in the county or city where the sale or delivery originated, or in the county or city where the illegal goods were found by the Commissioner.
