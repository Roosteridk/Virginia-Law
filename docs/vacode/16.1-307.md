In proceedings against a juvenile in the circuit court in which the circuit court deals with the child in the same manner as a case in the juvenile court, the clerk of the court shall preserve all records connected with the proceedings in files separate from other files and records of the court as provided in § [16.1-302](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-302/). Except as provided in §§ [19.2-389.1](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-389.1/) and [19.2-390](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-390/), such records shall be open for inspection only in accordance with the provisions of § [16.1-305](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-305/) and shall be subject to expungement provisions of § [16.1-306](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-306/). In proceedings in which a juvenile, fourteen years of age or older at the time of the offense, was adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court on the basis of an act which would be a felony if committed by an adult, or was found guilty of a felony in the circuit court, any court records, other than those specified in subsection A of § [16.1-305](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-305/), regarding that adjudication or conviction and any subsequent adjudication of delinquency or conviction of a crime, shall be available and shall be treated in the same manner as adult criminal records.
