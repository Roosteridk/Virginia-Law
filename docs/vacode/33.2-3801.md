# ยง 33.2-3801 Findings; purpose; governmental function.

The General Assembly finds that the creation of a regional passenger rail station authority will enable the members to cost share an economic development asset that is not affordable to individual members. A passenger rail station authority will directly benefit and enhance the economic base of the members by allowing the development, ownership, and operation of a facility on a cooperative basis. The exercise of powers granted by this chapter shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the region and other areas of the Commonwealth, for the increase of their commerce, and for the promotion of their safety, health, welfare, convenience, and prosperity.
