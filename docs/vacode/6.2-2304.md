"Notice of proceeding" means a notice of (i) lien of fieri facias, (ii) other process under §§ [8.01-474](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-474/), [8.01-478](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-478/), [8.01-479](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-479/), [8.01-501](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-501/) through [8.01-504](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-504/), and § [58.1-1804](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1804/), [58.1-2020](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2020/), or [58.1-3952](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3952/), (iii) levy for federal taxes, or (iv) attachment that states the office of the company where a box rented by the defendant is located.

B. If a company is served with a notice of proceeding with respect to a box, the company shall deny the defendant access to the box leased in the name of the defendant unless otherwise directed by an appropriate court or the judgment creditor.

C. If the notice of proceeding names less than all of the co-lessees of a box and:

1. If the rental contract so provides, the company may deny all co-lessees access to the box, unless otherwise directed by an appropriate court or the judgment creditor. The company may allow access to such co-lessee if in so doing the company complies with the requirements of subdivision 2 as if the rental contract did not provide for denial of access to co-lessees not named in the notice of proceeding; and

2. If the rental contract does not provide for denial of access to co-lessees not named in the notice of proceeding, the company shall not deny access to any co-lessee not named in the notice of proceeding if the co-lessee (i) is given notice by the company that if the co-lessee knowingly removes from the box any property subject to the notice of proceeding, the co-lessee shall be deemed guilty of larceny, (ii) is given a copy of the notice of proceeding, and (iii) signs and delivers to the company a written acknowledgment of receipt of such notices.
