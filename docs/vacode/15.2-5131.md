# § 15.2-5131 Bonds not debts of Commonwealth or participating political subdivision.

A. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision. All bonds shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the effect that neither the faith and credit of the Commonwealth nor the faith and credit of any political subdivision are pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the bonds. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the Commonwealth or any political subdivision to levy any taxes or to make any appropriation for their payment except from the funds pledged under the provisions of this chapter.

Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance which forms the authority or in a subsequent ordinance or resolution authorizing additional improvements, neither the Commonwealth nor any locality shall pay any part of the principal or interest of any bonds issued by a community development authority formed pursuant to §§ [15.2-5152](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-5152/) through [15.2-5157](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-5157/), nor shall any locality carry any part of such bonds on its financial statements as a contingent obligation; except that if a community development authority fails to pay such bonds, to the extent that a locality has imposed a real property tax surcharge or a special assessment at the request of a community development authority pursuant to subdivisions A 3 or A 5 of § [15.2-5158](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-5158/), funds collected from such sources may be paid against such debt.
