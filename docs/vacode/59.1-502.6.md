# ยง 59.1-502.6 Offer and acceptance; electronic agents.

(a) A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents. If the interaction results in the electronic agents' engaging in operations that under the circumstances indicate acceptance of an offer, a contract is formed, but a court may grant appropriate relief if the operations resulted from fraud, electronic mistake, or the like.

(b) A contract may be formed by the interaction of an electronic agent and an individual acting on the individual's own behalf or for another person. A contract is formed if the individual takes an action or makes a statement that the individual can refuse to take or say and that the individual has reason to know will:

(1) cause the electronic agent to perform, provide benefits, or allow the use or access that is the subject of the contract, or send instructions to do so; or

(2) indicate acceptance, regardless of other expressions or actions by the individual to which the individual has reason to know the electronic agent cannot react.

(c) The terms of a contract formed under subsection (b) are determined under ยง [59.1-502.8](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-502.8/) or ยง [59.1-502.9](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-502.9/) but do not include a term provided by the individual if the individual had reason to know that the electronic agent could not react to the term.
