The attorney for the Commonwealth may appeal a bail, bond, or recognizance decision to the same court to which the accused person is required to appeal under subsection A.</p><p>C. The court granting or denying such bail may, upon appeal thereof, and for good cause shown, stay execution of such order for so long as reasonably practicable for the party to obtain an expedited hearing before the next higher court.</p><p>No such stay under this subsection may be granted after any person who has been granted bail has been released from custody on such bail.</p><p>D. No filing or service fees shall be assessed or collected for any appeal taken pursuant to this section.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 19.1-109.3, 19.1-112; 1960, c. 366; 1973, cc. 130, 485; 1975, c. 495; 1978, c. 755; 1984, c. 703; 1991, c. 581; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0829'>829</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0846'>846</a>; 2007, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0462'>462</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0549'>549</a>; 2010, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0404'>404</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0592'>592</a>; 2013, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0408'>408</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0474'>474</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0621'>621</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0616'>616</a>; 2021, Sp.
