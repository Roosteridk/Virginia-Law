Whenever any warrant or summons is issued pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-72/'>19.2-72</a> or <a href='/vacode/19.2-74/'>19.2-74</a> for an offense in violation of any county, city, or town ordinance that is similar to any provision of this Code, and such warrant or summons references the offense using both the citation corresponding to the county, city, or town ordinance and the specific provision of this Code, any fine prescribed by the county, city, or town ordinance shall be paid to the locality. Fines imposed and costs taxed in a criminal or traffic prosecution, including a prosecution for a violation of an ordinance adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/46.2-1220/'>46.2-1220</a>, for committing an offense shall constitute a judgment and, if not paid at the time they are imposed, execution may issue thereon in the same manner as upon any other monetary judgment, subject to the period of limitations provided by § <a href='/vacode/19.2-341/'>19.2-341</a>.</p><p>Code 1950, § 19.1-324; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 495; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0438'>438</a>; 2021, Sp.
