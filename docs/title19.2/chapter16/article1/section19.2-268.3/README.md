The court finds, in a hearing conducted prior to a trial, that the time, content, and totality of circumstances surrounding the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability so as to render it inherently trustworthy. In determining such trustworthiness, the court may consider, among other things, the following factors:</p><p>a. The child's personal knowledge of the event;</p><p>b. The age, maturity, and mental state of the child;</p><p>c. The credibility of the person testifying about the statement;</p><p>d. Any apparent motive the child may have to falsify or distort the event, including bias or coercion;</p><p>e. Whether the child was suffering pain or distress when making the statement; and</p><p>f.

Is declared by the court to be unavailable as a witness; when the child has been declared unavailable, such statement may be admitted pursuant to this section only if there is corroborative evidence of the act relating to an alleged offense against children.</p><p>C.
