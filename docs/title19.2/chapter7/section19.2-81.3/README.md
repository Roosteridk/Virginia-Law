A law-enforcement officer having probable cause to believe that a violation of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-57.2/'>18.2-57.2</a> or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-253.2/'>16.1-253.2</a> has occurred shall arrest and take into custody the person he has probable cause to believe, based on the totality of the circumstances, was the predominant physical aggressor unless there are special circumstances which would dictate a course of action other than an arrest. The standards for determining who is the predominant physical aggressor shall be based on the following considerations: (i) who was the first aggressor, (ii) the protection of the health and safety of family and household members, (iii) prior complaints of family abuse by the allegedly abusing person involving the family or household members, (iv) the relative severity of the injuries inflicted on persons involved in the incident, (v) whether any injuries were inflicted in self-defense, (vi) witness statements, and (vii) other observations.</p><p>C. A law-enforcement officer having probable cause to believe that a violation of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-60.4/'>18.2-60.4</a> has occurred that involves physical aggression shall arrest and take into custody the person he has probable cause to believe, based on the totality of the circumstances, was the predominant physical aggressor unless there are special circumstances which would dictate a course of action other than an arrest. The standards for determining who is the predominant physical aggressor shall be based on the following considerations: (i) who was the first aggressor, (ii) the protection of the health and safety of the person to whom the protective order was issued and the person's family and household members, (iii) prior acts of violence, force, or threat, as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-152.7:1/'>19.2-152.7:1</a>, by the person against whom the protective order was issued against the person protected by the order or the protected person's family or household members, (iv) the relative severity of the injuries inflicted on persons involved in the incident, (v) whether any injuries were inflicted in self-defense, (vi) witness statements, and (vii) other observations.</p><p>D. Regardless of whether an arrest is made, the officer shall file a written report with his department, which shall state whether any arrests were made, and if so, the number of arrests, specifically including any incident in which he has probable cause to believe family abuse has occurred, and, where required, including a complete statement in writing that there are special circumstances that would dictate a course of action other than an arrest. The officer shall provide the allegedly abused person or the person protected by an order issued pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-152.8/'>19.2-152.8</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-152.9/'>19.2-152.9</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-152.10/'>19.2-152.10</a>, both orally and in writing, information regarding the legal and community resources available to the allegedly abused person or person protected by the order. Upon request of the allegedly abused person or person protected by the order, the department shall make a summary of the report available to the allegedly abused person or person protected by the order.</p><p>E. In every case in which a law-enforcement officer makes an arrest under this section for a violation of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-57.2/'>18.2-57.2</a>, he shall petition for an emergency protective order as authorized in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-253.4/'>16.1-253.4</a> when the person arrested and taken into custody is brought before the magistrate, except if the person arrested is a minor, a petition for an emergency protective order shall not be required. Regardless of whether an arrest is made, if the officer has probable cause to believe that a danger of acts of family abuse exists, the law-enforcement officer shall seek an emergency protective order under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-253.4/'>16.1-253.4</a>, except if the suspected abuser is a minor, a petition for an emergency protective order shall not be required.</p><p>F. A law-enforcement officer investigating any complaint of family abuse, including but not limited to assault and battery against a family or household member shall, upon request, transport, or arrange for the transportation of an abused person to a hospital or safe shelter, or to appear before a magistrate. Any local law-enforcement agency may adopt a policy requiring an officer to transport or arrange for transportation of an abused person as provided in this subsection.</p><p>G.
