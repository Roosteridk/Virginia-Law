Except as provided in subsection A of ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1040/'>13.1-1040</a>, an assignment does not entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of the limited liability company or to become or to exercise any rights of a member. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, such an assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only any share of profits and losses and distributions to which the assignor would be entitled.</p><p>B.
