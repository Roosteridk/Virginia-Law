# § 13.1-1051 Authority to transact business required; governing law.

<p>A. A foreign limited liability company may not transact business in the Commonwealth until it obtains a certificate of registration from the Commission.</p><p>B. Subject to the Constitution of the Commonwealth:</p><p>1. Except as provided in §§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-1099.8/'>13.1-1099.8</a> and <a href='/vacode/13.1-1099.10/'>13.1-1099.10</a>, the laws of the state or other jurisdiction under which a foreign limited liability company is formed govern its formation and internal affairs and the liability of its members and managers; and</p><p>2. A foreign limited liability company may not be denied a certificate of registration by reason of any difference between those laws and the laws of the Commonwealth.</p><p>However, a foreign limited liability company holding a valid certificate of registration to transact business in the Commonwealth shall have no greater rights and privileges than a domestic limited liability company. The certificate of registration shall not be deemed to authorize the foreign limited liability company to exercise any of its powers or purposes that a domestic limited liability company is forbidden by law to exercise in the Commonwealth.</p><p>1991, c. 168; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0108'>108</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0636'>636</a>.</p>
