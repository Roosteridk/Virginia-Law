# § 13.1-735.1 Perfection of rights; right to withdraw.

<p>A. A shareholder who receives notice pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-734/'>13.1-734</a> and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must complete, sign, and return the form delivered by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder's certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to subdivision B 2 b of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-734/'>13.1-734</a>. In addition, if applicable, the shareholder shall certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to subdivision B 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-734/'>13.1-734</a>. If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder's shares as after-acquired shares under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-738/'>13.1-738</a>. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder's certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed form, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection B.</p><p>B. A shareholder who has complied with subsection A may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the secretary of the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to subdivision B 2 e of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-734/'>13.1-734</a>. A shareholder who fails to withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation's written consent.</p><p>C. A shareholder who does not sign and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit that shareholder's share certificates where required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in subsection B of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-734/'>13.1-734</a>, shall not be entitled to payment under this article.</p><p>2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0165'>165</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>
