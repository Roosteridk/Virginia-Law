One or more officers of the corporation present at a meeting of the board of directors may be deemed by a majority of the directors present at the meeting to be directors for the meeting, in order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, as necessary to achieve a quorum.</p><p>C. During such an emergency, the board of directors, or, if a quorum cannot be readily convened for a meeting, a majority of the directors present, may:</p><p>1. Take any action that it determines to be practical and necessary to address circumstances of the emergency with respect to a meeting of shareholders notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, including (i) to postpone any such meeting to a later time or date, with the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting applying to the postponed meeting irrespective of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-660/'>13.1-660</a>, unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, and (ii) with respect to a corporation subject to the reporting requirements of § 13(a) or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to notify shareholders of any postponement, a change of the place of the meeting, or a change to hold the meeting solely by means of remote communication pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-660.2/'>13.1-660.2</a> solely by a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to § 13, 14, or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and</p><p>2. With respect to any distribution that has been declared as to which the record date has not occurred, cancel such distribution, change the amount of such distribution, or change the record date or the payment date to a later date; provided that, in any such case, the corporation gives notice of such action to shareholders as promptly as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the record date theretofore in effect. Such notice, in the case of a corporation subject to the reporting requirements of § 13(a) or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may be given solely by a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to § 13, 14, or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</p><p>No person shall be liable and no meeting of shareholders shall be postponed or voided for the failure to make a list of shareholders available pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-661/'>13.1-661</a> if it was not practicable to allow inspection during such an emergency.</p><p>D. Corporate action taken in good faith during such an emergency under this section to further the ordinary business affairs of the corporation:</p><p>1. Binds the corporation; and</p><p>2. May not be used to impose liability on a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation.</p><p>1985, c. 522; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2021, Sp.
