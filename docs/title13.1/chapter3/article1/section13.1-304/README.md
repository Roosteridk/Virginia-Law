# ยง 13.1-304 Purchase of business by issue of shares of stock.

<p>Whenever any stock cooperative association shall purchase the business of another association, person or persons, it may pay for the same in whole or in part by issuing to the selling association or person shares of its capital stock to an amount which at par value would equal the fair market value of the business so purchased, and in such case the transfer to the association of such business at such valuation shall be equivalent to payment in cash for the shares of stock so issued. In case the cash value of such purchased business exceeds $1,000 the directors of the association are authorized to hold the shares in excess of $1,000 in trust for the vendor and dispose of the same to such persons and within such time, as may be mutually satisfactory to the parties in interest, and to pay the proceeds thereof as currently received to the former owners of such business.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 13-241; 1956, c. 428; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0217'>217</a>.</p>
