The Commission shall admit any such certificate to record in its office.</p><p>B. The existence of a business trust shall begin at the time the Commission issues a certificate of trust, unless a later date and time are specified as provided by subsection D.

Whenever the Commission is directed to admit any document to record in its office, it shall cause it to be spread upon its record books or to be recorded or reproduced in any other manner the Commission may deem suitable. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Commission may furnish information from and provide access to any of its records by any means the Commission may deem suitable.</p><p>D. 1. A certificate issued by the Commission is effective at the time such certificate is issued, unless the certificate relates to articles filed with the Commission and the articles state that the certificate shall become effective at a later time or date specified in the articles.

Any other document filed with the Commission shall be effective when accepted for filing unless otherwise provided for in this chapter.</p><p>2. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, any certificate that has a delayed effective time or date shall not become effective if, prior to the effective time and date, a statement of cancellation signed by each party to the articles to which the certificate relates is delivered to the Commission for filing. If the Commission finds that the statement of cancellation complies with the requirements of the law, it shall, by order, cancel the certificate.</p><p>3. A statement of cancellation shall contain:</p><p>a. The name of the business trust;</p><p>b. The name of the articles and the date on which the articles were filed with the Commission;</p><p>c.
