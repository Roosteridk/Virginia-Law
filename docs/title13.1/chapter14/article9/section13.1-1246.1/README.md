If any foreign business trust whose registered agent has filed with the Commission a statement of resignation pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1222/'>13.1-1222</a> fails to file a statement of change pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1221/'>13.1-1221</a> within 31 days after the date on which the statement of resignation was filed, the Commission shall mail notice to the foreign business trust of the impending cancellation of its certificate of registration.

The automatic cancellation of a foreign business trust's certificate of registration constitutes the appointment of the clerk of the Commission as the foreign business trust's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time the foreign business trust was registered to transact business in the Commonwealth. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission under this subsection is service on the foreign business trust and shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/12.1-19.1/'>12.1-19.1</a>.</p><p>D.
