# ยง 48-17 Enjoining nuisances involving illegal drug transactions.

<p>The attorney for the Commonwealth, or any citizen of the county, city, or town, where such a nuisance as is described in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-258/'>18.2-258</a> exists, may, in addition to any other remedies and punishment, maintain a suit in equity in the name of the Commonwealth to enjoin the same. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall not be required to prosecute any suit brought by a citizen under this section. In every case where the bill charges, on the knowledge or belief of the complainant, and is sworn to by two witnesses, that a nuisance exists as described in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-258/'>18.2-258</a>, a temporary injunction may be granted as soon as the bill is presented to the court provided reasonable notice has been given. The injunction shall enjoin and restrain any owners, tenants, their agents, employees, and any other person from contributing to or maintaining the nuisance and may impose such other requirements as the court deems appropriate. If, after a hearing, the court finds that the material allegations of the bill are true, although the premises complained of may not then be unlawfully used, it shall continue the injunction against such persons or premises for such period of time as it deems appropriate, with the right to dissolve the injunction upon a proper showing by the owner of the premises.</p><p>2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0462'>462</a>.</p>
