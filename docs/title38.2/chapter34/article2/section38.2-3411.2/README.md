No insurer, health services plan or health maintenance organization shall restrict coverage for any dependent child adopted or placed for adoption solely because of a preexisting condition of such child at the time that such child would otherwise become eligible for coverage under the plan.</p><p>1991, c. 103; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0213'>213</a>.</p>
