# § 38.2-2218 Adoption of standard forms for motor vehicle insurance.

<p>The Commission shall prepare a standard form whenever it believes that any form of policy or any form of rider, endorsement, or other supplemental agreement or provision, for use in connection with any contract of motor vehicle insurance to be issued or delivered upon any motor vehicle principally garaged or principally used in this Commonwealth, is so extensively used that a standard form is desirable. The Commission shall file a copy of the standard form in its office and shall provide by order that, at least 30 days after the order, the form shall become a standard form for use by all insurers unless objection to the proposed form is filed with the Commission within 20 days after the entry of the order. The Commission shall provide notice of its order to all insurers licensed to transact the class of insurance to which the form is applicable, and to all rate service and advisory organizations representing those insurers.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 38-240, 38-551; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-382; 1986, c. 562; 2022, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0180'>180</a>.</p>
