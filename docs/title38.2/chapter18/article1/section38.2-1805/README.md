<p>A. No agent of a home service insurer shall accept, and no insurer or licensed agent shall knowingly permit an agent to accept, payment of premiums in arrears on any policy of life insurance or accident and sickness insurance on which the premiums are collected at least monthly that has lapsed and that the insured seeks to reinstate, unless the payment (i) at least equals the total of all premiums in arrears and (ii) entitles the policyholder to make immediate application for reinstatement of the policy. As used in this chapter, "home service insurer" means an insurer selling industrial or ordinary life insurance or accident and sickness insurance on a debit, where the premiums are payable at least monthly directly by the owner of the policy or a person representing the owner to a representative of the insurer.</p><p>B. Every advance premium paid to an agent on a life insurance policy or accident and sickness insurance policy on which the premiums are collected at least monthly shall be recorded in the receipt book of the insured and in the record book of the agent in exactly the same manner as current premiums are recorded. However, the failure to do so shall not invalidate the policy.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 38.1-293; 1952, c. 317; 1979, c. 513, ยง 38.1-327.6; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 521; 1990, c. 464; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0706'>706</a>.</p>
