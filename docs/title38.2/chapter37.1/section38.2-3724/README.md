Each individual policy and certificate shall have printed on it a notice stating in substance that if, during a period of at least ten days from the date the policy or certificate is delivered to the policyowner or certificateholder the policy or certificate is surrendered to the insurer or its agent with a written request for cancellation, the policy or certificate shall be void from the beginning and the insurer shall refund any premium paid for the policy or certificate; and</p><p>8. Each individual policy or group certificate paid in advance or by a single premium shall include a provision, separately and prominently captioned, stating in substance the following:</p><p>"REFUND OF PREMIUM IN THE EVENT OF EARLY TERMINATION"</p><p>"In the event this insurance policy or certificate is terminated prior to its originally scheduled maturity date, or the insured indebtedness is terminated or paid off earlier than scheduled, the insurer shall, within 30 days of receipt of notification from the debtor of such termination or early payoff, refund or credit any amount paid by the debtor for the insurance beyond the actual date of termination or payoff. Early termination of debt includes termination by renewal or refinancing.

An individual credit life insurance or credit accident and sickness insurance policy or certificate of insurance shall be delivered or mailed to the insured debtor at the time the indebtedness is incurred or within ten business days thereafter except as provided in subsection F of this section. For open-end credit transactions, agricultural or educational loan commitments, or where no direct charge is made to the debtor for his insurance, the individual policy or group certificate of insurance may be delivered to the insured debtor at the time he first becomes eligible for the insurance and need not be delivered again each time new indebtedness is added.</p><p>F. If the individual policy or certificate of insurance is not delivered or mailed to the debtor at the time indebtedness is incurred, or within ten business days thereafter, a notice of proposed insurance, setting forth (i) the name and address of the insurer, (ii) the name or names of the debtor, (iii) the age of the debtor, (iv) the premium or amount of payment by the debtor, if any, separately for credit life insurance and credit accident and sickness insurance, and (v) the amount, term and a brief description of the coverage provided, shall be delivered to the debtor. The notice of proposed insurance shall refer exclusively to insurance coverage and shall be separate and apart from the loan or credit transaction. Upon acceptance of the insurance by the insurer and within thirty days of the date upon which the indebtedness is incurred, the insurer shall deliver or mail the individual policy or group certificate of insurance to the debtor. The notice of proposed insurance shall state that upon acceptance by the insurer, the insurance shall become effective as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3721/'>38.2-3721</a>.</p><p>G. If the policy or certificate is issued by any insurer other than the insurer listed on the application, enrollment request, or notice of proposed insurance, the debtor shall receive a policy or certificate of insurance setting forth the name and address of the substituted insurer and the amount of the premium to be charged. If the amount of the premium is less than that set forth in the notice of proposed insurance, an appropriate refund shall be made.</p><p>1960, c. 67, § 38.1-482.6; 1982, c. 223, §§ 38.2-3707, 38.2-3709; 1986, c. 562; 1988, c. 551; 1992, c. 586; 2009, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0643'>643</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0211'>211</a>.</p>
