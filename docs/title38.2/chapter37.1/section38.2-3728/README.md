# § 38.2-3728 Use of rates.

<p>A. Use of prima facie rates. An insurer that files rates or has rates on file that are not in excess of the prima facie rates set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3726/'>38.2-3726</a> or published as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3727/'>38.2-3727</a>, to the extent adjusted pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3730/'>38.2-3730</a>, may use those rates without further proof of their reasonableness.</p><p>B. Use of rates higher than prima facie rates. An insurer may file for approval of and use rates that are higher than the prima facie rates set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3726/'>38.2-3726</a> or published as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3727/'>38.2-3727</a>, to the extent adjusted by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3730/'>38.2-3730</a>. In order to use these higher rates, it shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the use of such higher rates will result in a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned (assuming the use of such higher rates) that is not less than the loss ratios as required by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3725/'>38.2-3725</a> D and E for those accounts to which such higher rates apply and that such upward deviations will not result on a statewide basis for that insurer of a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned of less than the expected loss ratio underlying the current prima facie rate developed or adjusted pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3730/'>38.2-3730</a>. Deviations effective for 1993 and 1994 for credit life insurance shall be derived based upon a fifty percent loss ratio.</p><p>If rates higher than the prima facie rates provided for in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3726/'>38.2-3726</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3727/'>38.2-3727</a>, to the extent adjusted pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3730/'>38.2-3730</a>, are filed for approval, the filing shall specify the account or accounts to which such rates apply. Such rates may be applied on an equitable basis approved by the Commission to only one or more accounts specified by the insurer for which the experience has been less favorable than expected.</p><p>C. Approval period of deviated rates.</p><p>1. A deviated rate will be in effect for a period of time not longer than the experience period used to establish such rate. In no event will deviated rates remain in effect after the effective date that new prima facie rates are effective as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3730/'>38.2-3730</a>.</p><p>2. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the prima facie rates shall be employed in the event that the account becomes insured by another insurer.</p><p>D. As used in this section:</p><p>1. "Experience" means "earned premiums" and "incurred claims" during the experience period.</p><p>2. "Experience period" means the most recent period of time for which experience is reported, but not for a period longer than three full years.</p><p>3. "Incurred claims" means total claims paid during the experience period, adjusted for the change in claim reserve.</p><p>1992, c. 586.</p>
