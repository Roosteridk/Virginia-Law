If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 1, but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subdivision B 2, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1334.6/'>38.2-1334.6</a> shall be the report applicable to that insurer.</p><p>E.
