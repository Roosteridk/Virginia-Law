Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, the Commission may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants, or other similar individuals or firms who are independently practicing their professions, even though said persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination under this article.</p><p>B.

Every company or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors, and agents shall provide the examiners convenient access at all reasonable hours to its books, records, files, securities, accounts, papers, documents, and any or all computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business and affairs of the company being examined or those of any person, including any affiliates or subsidiaries of the person examined, that are relevant to the examination.</p><p>1. The officers, directors, employees and agents of the company or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so.</p><p>2. The refusal of any company, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the examiners shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of, any license or authority held by the company to engage in an insurance or other business subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Any such proceedings for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1040/'>38.2-1040</a>.</p><p>D.

Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the Commission may deem appropriate.</p><p>H.
