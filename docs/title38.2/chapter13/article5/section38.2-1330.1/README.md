# ยง 38.2-1330.1 Dividends and other distributions.

<p>A. Except as otherwise provided by law, a domestic insurer shall not declare or pay a dividend or other distribution from any source other than earned surplus without the Commission's prior written approval. For purposes of this section, "earned surplus" means an amount equal to the unassigned funds (surplus) of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer filed with the Commission including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets. No domestic insurer shall pay an extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until the earlier of:</p><p>1. Thirty days after the Commission has received written notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such payment; or</p><p>2. The Commission's approval of such payment.</p><p>B. For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (i) 10 percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the immediately preceding December 31, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.</p><p>C. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p><p>D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the Commission's approval thereof, and such declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:</p><p>1. The Commission has approved the payment of such dividend or distribution; or</p><p>2. The Commission has not disapproved such payment within the 30-day period described in subsection A.</p><p>E. The Commission may limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends by a domestic insurer if the insurer is presently or potentially financially distressed or troubled. The Commission shall set forth the specific reasons for limiting or disallowing the payment of any ordinary dividends.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0577'>577</a>; 2014, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0309'>309</a>.</p>
