# ยง 38.2-1334.1 Voting of securities, injunctions, and sequestration of voting securities.

<p>A. No security that is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission hereunder, may be voted at any shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though such securities were not issued and outstanding. However, no action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of such securities, unless the action would materially affect control of an insurer subject to any provision of this article or unless the Commission or other court of the Commonwealth has so ordered. If the insurer or Commissioner of Insurance has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commission hereunder, the insurer or Commissioner of Insurance may apply to the Commission to enter an order (i) enjoining any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition made in contravention of ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1323/'>38.2-1323</a>; (ii) enforcing any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission under the foregoing sections to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired; or (iii) voiding any vote of such security already cast at any meeting of shareholders or providing for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require.</p><p>B. Whenever it appears to the Commission that any person has committed or is about to commit a violation of this article, the Commission may enter an order enjoining such person from violating or continuing to violate this article or any such rule or order, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interests of the domestic insurer's policyholders or the public may require.</p><p>C. In any case where a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this article or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission hereunder, the Commission may, after reasonable notice, upon application of the insurer or application of the Commissioner of Insurance, seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue the order with respect thereto as may be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this article.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this article, the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers shall be deemed to be in the Commonwealth.</p><p>D. The actions authorized by this section are in addition to any remedies provided for by other sections of this title and may be imposed, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalties or actions provided for by law, whenever such actions involve a person that is neither domiciled nor licensed in this Commonwealth.</p><p>1993, c. 158; 2014, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0309'>309</a>.</p>
