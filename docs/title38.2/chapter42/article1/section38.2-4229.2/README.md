<p>A. If another state enacts a law or takes any other regulatory action that requires a health services plan operating in the Commonwealth to provide a program or benefits for the residents of the other state or to distribute or reduce its surplus on grounds that it is excessive in whole or in part, the Commission shall conduct a proceeding to review and evaluate the impact of the law or action on the health services plan. The Commission shall direct the Commissioner to conduct an examination of the health service plan in accordance with Article 4 (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1317/'>38.2-1317</a> et seq.) of Chapter 13 and report its findings to the Commission, including the impact on (i) surplus; (ii) premium rates for residents of the Commonwealth covered by policies issued or delivered either in the Commonwealth or in any other state; and (iii) solvency.</p><p>B.

If the Commission determines the program or benefits for the residents of another state or the surplus distribution or reduction has an impact on the health services plan that is harmful to the interests of residents of the Commonwealth covered by policies issued or delivered either in the Commonwealth or in any other state, the Commission shall issue an appropriate order to protect such residents of the Commonwealth. The order may include:</p><p>1. A prohibition on the health services plan subsidizing the program or benefits for the residents of another state through:</p><p>a.

No health services plan shall distribute or reduce its surplus pursuant to a law or regulatory action the impact of which is subject to a proceeding under subsection A except with the approval of the Commission after the examination required by this section.</p><p>2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0704'>704</a>; 2015, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0519'>519</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0520'>520</a>.</p>
