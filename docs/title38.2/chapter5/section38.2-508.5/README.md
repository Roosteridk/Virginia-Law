This section shall not prohibit adjustments to premium, rescission of, or amendments to the insurance contract in the following circumstances:</p><p>1. When an insurer learns of information subsequent to issuing the policy or certificate that was not disclosed in the underwriting process and that, had it been known, would have resulted in a higher premium level or denial of coverage. Any adjustment to premium or rescission of coverage made for this reason may be made only to extent that it would have been made had the information been disclosed in the application process, and shall not be imposed beyond any period of incontestability, or beyond any time period proscribing an insurer from asserting defenses based upon misstatements in applications, as otherwise may be provided by applicable law. Any such rescission shall be consistent with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3430.3/'>38.2-3430.3</a> regarding guaranteed availability.</p><p>2.

The provisions of this section shall not apply in any instance in which the provisions of this section are inconsistent or in conflict with a provision of Article 6 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3438/'>38.2-3438</a> et seq.) of Chapter 34.</p><p>2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0699'>699</a>; 2011, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0882'>882</a>.</p>
