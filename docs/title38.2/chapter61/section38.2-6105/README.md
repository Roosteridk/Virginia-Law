The dental plan organization will pay the enrollee for the expenses incurred for the dental services with the following limitations: The dental plan organization will pay the enrollee for services that are listed in the patient charge schedule as "No Charge," to the extent that such fees are reasonable and customary for dentists in the same geographic area; the dental plan organization will also pay the enrollee for those services listed in the contract for which there is a copayment, to the extent that the reasonable and customary fees for such services exceed the copayment for such services as set forth in the contract.

The extension of benefits shall be, at a minimum, for all types of dental care other than orthodontics, until the completion of the procedure.</p><p>3. For orthodontics, the extension of benefits will be at least 60 days if the orthodontist has agreed to or is receiving monthly payments when coverage terminates, or if the orthodontist has agreed to accept or is receiving payments on a quarterly basis, to the end of the quarter in progress or 60 days, whichever is longer.</p><p>4. An extension of benefits is not required if termination is due solely to the failure of the enrollee to pay the subscription fee or premium when the enrollee is otherwise eligible to continue coverage under the dental benefit contract.</p><p>2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0668'>668</a>.</p>
