Specific types of information include particular data elements such as medical information, financial information, or other information allowing identification of the consumer;</p><p>8. The period during which the information system was compromised by the cybersecurity event;</p><p>9. The number of consumers in the Commonwealth affected by the cybersecurity event. The licensee shall provide the best estimate in the initial report to the Commissioner and update this estimate with each subsequent report to the Commissioner pursuant to this section;</p><p>10.

A licensee shall have a continuing obligation to update and supplement initial and subsequent notifications to the Commissioner concerning the cybersecurity event.</p><p>D. Each licensee shall notify consumers in compliance with § <a href='/vacode/38.2-626/'>38.2-626</a>, and provide a copy of the notice sent to consumers under such section to the Commissioner, when a licensee is required to notify the Commissioner under this section.</p><p>E. If there is a cybersecurity event in a system maintained by a third-party service provider, the licensee, once it has become aware of such cybersecurity event, shall treat such event as it would under this section, unless the third-party service provider provides notice in accordance with this section. The computation of a licensee's deadlines shall begin on the day after the third-party service provider notifies a licensee of the cybersecurity event or the licensee otherwise has actual knowledge of the cybersecurity event, whichever is sooner.</p><p>F. If a cybersecurity event involves nonpublic information that is used by a licensee that is acting as an assuming insurer or is in the possession, control, or custody of a licensee that is acting as an assuming insurer or its third-party service provider and the licensee does not have a direct contractual relationship with the affected consumers, the licensee shall notify its affected ceding insurers and the head of its supervisory state agency of its state of domicile within three business days of making the determination or receiving notice from its third-party service provider that a cybersecurity event has occurred. Ceding insurers that have a direct contractual relationship with affected consumers shall fulfill the consumer notification requirements imposed under § <a href='/vacode/38.2-626/'>38.2-626</a> and any other notification requirements relating to a cybersecurity event imposed under this section.</p><p>G. If there is a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic information that is in the possession, custody, or control of a licensee that is an insurer or its third-party service provider and for which a consumer accessed the insurer's services through an independent insurance producer, the insurer shall notify the producers of record of all affected consumers as soon as practicable as directed by the Commissioner. The insurer is excused from this obligation for those instances in which it does not have the current producer of record information for any individual consumer.</p><p>H. Nothing in this article shall prevent or abrogate an agreement between a licensee and another licensee, a third-party service provider, or any other party to fulfill any of the investigation requirements imposed under § <a href='/vacode/38.2-624/'>38.2-624</a> or notice requirements imposed under this section.</p><p>2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0264'>264</a>.</p>
