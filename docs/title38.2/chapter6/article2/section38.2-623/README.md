As part of its information security program, each licensee shall establish a written incident response plan designed to promptly respond to, and recover from, any cybersecurity event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of nonpublic information in its possession; the licensee's information systems; or the continuing functionality of any aspect of the licensee's business or operations.
