# § 38.2-1223 Subscriber's agreement and power of attorney.

<p>A. Every subscriber of a domestic assessable reciprocal shall execute a subscriber's agreement and power of attorney setting forth the rights, privileges and obligations of the subscriber as an underwriter and as a policyholder, and the powers and duties of the attorney. Every subscriber of a nonassessable reciprocal may execute a subscriber's agreement and power of attorney setting forth the rights, privileges, and obligations of the subscriber as an underwriter and as a policyholder, and the powers and duties of the attorney. If a nonassessable reciprocal does not require execution of a subscriber's agreement and power of attorney, the reciprocal shall include on its policies a statement that the subscriber shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the then current subscriber's agreement and power of attorney on file with the attorney and the Commission, a copy of which shall be provided to each subscriber with each new or renewal policy, and each subscriber shall by operation of law be bound by such subscriber's agreement and power of attorney as if individually executed. Without additional execution, notice or acceptance, every subscriber of a reciprocal agrees to be bound by any modification of the terms of the power of attorney and subscriber's agreement which is jointly made by the attorney and the subscribers' advisory committee pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1224/'>38.2-1224</a>, and which shall be on file with the attorney and the Commission.
