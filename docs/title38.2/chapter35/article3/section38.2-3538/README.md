# ยง 38.2-3538 Payment of benefits.

<p>Each group accident and sickness insurance policy shall contain a provision that benefits for loss of life of the person insured shall be payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured. However, if the policy contains conditions pertaining to family status, the beneficiary may be the family member specified by the policy terms. In either case, payment of those benefits is subject to the provisions of the policy in the event no such designated or specified beneficiary is living at the death of the person insured. The policy may also provide that if any benefit is payable to the estate of a person, or to a person who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the benefit, up to an amount not exceeding $5,000, to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the person who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled to the benefit. The policy may also provide that all or any portion of any benefits provided for health care services may be paid to the health care services provider. All other benefits of the policy shall be payable to the person insured.</p><p>1986, c. 562; 1991, c. 87.</p>
