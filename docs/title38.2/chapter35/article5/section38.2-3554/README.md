# § 38.2-3554 Provisions relating to health insurance issuers.

<p>A. No group health policy shall be offered to a small employer group health cooperative that will cover a resident of the Commonwealth unless the Commission finds that:</p><p>1. The issuance of such group health policy is not contrary to Virginia's public policy and is in the best interest of the citizens of the Commonwealth;</p><p>2. The issuance of the group health policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration; and</p><p>3. The benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged.</p><p>B. Issuers filing policy forms seeking approval under the provisions of this subsection shall provide with the forms a certification, signed by the officer of the company with the responsibility for forms compliance, in which the company certifies that each such policy form will be issued only when the requirements set forth in subdivisions 1 through 3 of subsection A have been satisfied.</p><p>C. If a small employer health group cooperative has elected, under subdivision B 1 a of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3552/'>38.2-3552</a>, to be deemed the policyholder of a group health policy covering the eligible employees and eligible dependents of its employer-members within the service area of an issuer and has furnished the authorization required under subdivision B 2 of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3552/'>38.2-3552</a>, the issuer of such policy shall deem the small employer health group cooperative to be the policyholder in all respects permissible under applicable state and federal laws and regulations.</p><p>D. If a small employer health group cooperative has elected, under subdivision B 1 b of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3552/'>38.2-3552</a>, to be deemed only a sponsoring entity facilitating the acquisition of separate group health policies for its employer-members within the service area of an issuer, the issuer shall issue a separate policy to each such employer-member of the cooperative. Each such policy shall conform to the benefit and premium specifications and other policy terms mutually agreed upon by the issuer and the small employer health group cooperative in accordance with subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-3552/'>38.2-3552</a>.</p><p>E. An issuer providing a group health policy or policies to or through a small employer health group cooperative shall make such policy or policies available to every eligible employee of an employer-member within its service area who applies for such policy or policies, and their eligible dependents, subject to an individual employee's right to reject coverage in writing. No coverage may be offered only to certain eligible employees or their eligible dependents, and no eligible employees or their eligible dependents may be excluded or charged additional premiums, because of health status-related factors.</p><p>F. The premiums for the policy or policies issued to or through a small employer health group cooperative shall be paid from funds contributed by the small employer health group cooperative, its employer-members, or both; or from funds contributed by the covered persons, or from both the covered persons and the employer-members or small employer health group cooperative.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0427'>427</a>.</p>
