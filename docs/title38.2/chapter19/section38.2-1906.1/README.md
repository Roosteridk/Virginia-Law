# ยง 38.2-1906.1 Misquote of premium.

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an insurer or its agent provides a written quotation for insurance to an insured or applicant for insurance and the rate filing in effect for the insurer results in a premium increase of ten percent or more over the quoted premium, the insured or applicant may, within fifteen days of written notification of the increase by the insurer or its agent, request cancellation of the contract or policy. The insurer shall, upon receipt of such request, cancel the contract or policy calculating the earned premium pro rata using the premium originally quoted by the insurer or its agent. Nothing in this section shall apply to any increase in premium which is the result of incorrect information furnished by the insured or applicant or information omitted by the insured or applicant.</p><p>1990, c. 503.</p>
