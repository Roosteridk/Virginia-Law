Each rate service organization licensed under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1914/'>38.2-1914</a> that has been designated by an insurer for the filing of prospective loss costs or supplementary rate information under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1908/'>38.2-1908</a> shall file with the Commission all prospective loss costs or supplementary rate information and all changes and amendments to the prospective loss costs or supplementary rate information made by it for use in the Commonwealth on or before the date they become effective.

Such limitation shall apply for the period of time specified in the insurer's filing. Nothing shall prohibit such limitation from applying to policies (a) acquired by an insurer from another insurer pursuant to a written agreement of acquisition, merger, or sale that transfers all or part of the other insurer's book of business or (b) transferred by an agent from one insurer to another insurer pursuant to an agent book of transfer.</p><p>1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.34; 1976, c. 278; 1986, c. 562; 1987, c. 697; 1990, cc. 596, 597; 1993, c. 985; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0199'>199</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0838'>838</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0095'>95</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0619'>619</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0277'>277</a>.</p>
