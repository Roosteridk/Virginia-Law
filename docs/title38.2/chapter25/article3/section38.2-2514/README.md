# § 38.2-2514 Procedure upon exclusion of member.

<p>If any member is excluded from the insurer as provided in this article, the insurer shall note upon its records the exclusion of the member, the cancellation of his insurance policies, and the date of the exclusion. The insurer shall notify the member by mail of the exclusion and cancellation, and after at least five days have elapsed from the mailing of the notice, the policy shall no longer be effective and all further liability of the insurer under the policy shall cease. Proper notification shall be deemed to have been effected if the notice is deposited with the United States Postal Service and mailed to the member at his address as shown on the records of the insurer. If the bylaws or the policy provide that a member's policy shall be void without any notice if the member neglects or refuses to pay any assessment, that provision shall be valid and the notice required in this section need not be given. Upon the cancellation of the insurance or upon the policy becoming void, the member shall be entitled to receive from the insurer a repayment of an equitable portion of any premium, fee or assessment which was paid in advance.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 38-537, 38-538; 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-671; 1986, c. 562.</p>
