<p>Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the immediate suspension without pay of any correctional officer whose continued presence in the workplace may be harmful to the correctional officer, other employees, contractors, volunteers, prisoners, or the public; makes it impossible for the agency to conduct business; may hamper an internal investigation into the correctional officer's alleged misconduct; may hamper an investigation being conducted by law enforcement; or may constitute negligence in regard to the agency's duties to the public, other employees, contractors, volunteers, or prisoners. Further, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the suspension of a correctional officer for refusing to obey a direct order issued in compliance with the agency's written and disseminated policies. In such a case, the correctional officer shall, upon request, be afforded the rights provided under this chapter within a reasonable amount of time set by the agency.</p><p>2018, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0761'>761</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0762'>762</a>.</p>
