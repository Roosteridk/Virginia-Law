# ยง 56-551 Termination of certificate; dedication of assets.

<p>Within ninety days of the completion and closing of the original permanent financing, the operator shall provide full details of the financing, including the terms of all bonds, to the Commission; and shall certify the term of the original permanent financing and its termination date. The Commission may require that the operator provide copies of any relevant documents, and shall review the financing and determine the date of termination of the original permanent financing. After establishing this date, the Commission shall enter an order terminating the operator's authority pursuant to the certificate of authority on a date which shall be ten years from the end of the term of the original permanent financing. At the request of the operator or the Department, or on its own initiative, the Commission may revise its order to modify the date for termination of the certificate of authority in order to take into account any refinancing of the original permanent financing, where the refinancing or modification is in the public interest, or any refinancing for the purpose of expansion, or early termination of the original permanent financing. Upon the termination of the certificate of authority, the authority and duties of the operator under this chapter shall cease, and the highway assets and improvements of the operator shall be dedicated to the Commonwealth for highway purposes.</p><p>1988, c. 649; 1991, c. 272.</p>
