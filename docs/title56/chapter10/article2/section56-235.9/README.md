Such recovery shall be permitted by allowing such costs to be recorded in the utility's plant accounts and included in rate base for purposes of cost recovery (i) in new rate schedules for service not offered under existing rate schedules or new rate schedules for expansion of existing services as permitted by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-235.4/'>56-235.4</a>, (ii) in a rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-235.2/'>56-235.2</a>, or (iii) in a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-235.6/'>56-235.6</a>, subject to Commission determination that such costs were prudently incurred. The allowance for funds used during construction and the return on investment shall be calculated utilizing the weighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and cost of equity used in determining the natural gas utility's base rates in effect during the construction period of the strategic natural gas facility.</p><p>C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from granting similar treatment to other natural gas facilities when the Commission deems such treatment to be in the public interest.</p><p>2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0867'>867</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0467'>467</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0507'>507</a>.</p>
