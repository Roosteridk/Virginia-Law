<p>The Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4300/'>2.2-4300</a> et seq.) and any interpretations, regulations, or guidelines of the Division of Engineering and Buildings of the Department of General Services or the Virginia Information Technologies Agency, including the Capital Outlay Manual and those interpretations, regulations or guidelines developed pursuant to §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1131/'>2.2-1131</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1132/'>2.2-1132</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1133/'>2.2-1133</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1149/'>2.2-1149</a>, and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-1502/'>2.2-1502</a>, except those developed by the Division or the Virginia Information Technologies Agency in accordance with this chapter when the Commonwealth is the responsible public entity, shall not apply to this chapter. However, a responsible public entity may enter into a comprehensive agreement only in accordance with guidelines adopted by it as follows:</p><p>1. A responsible public entity may enter into a comprehensive agreement in accordance with guidelines adopted by it that are consistent with procurement through competitive sealed bidding as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.1/'>2.2-4302.1</a> and subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/'>2.2-4310</a>.</p><p>2. A responsible public entity may enter into a comprehensive agreement in accordance with guidelines adopted by it that are consistent with the procurement of "other than professional services" through competitive negotiation as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.2/'>2.2-4302.2</a> and subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/'>2.2-4310</a>. Such responsible public entity shall not be required to select the proposal with the lowest price offer, but may consider price as one factor in evaluating the proposals received. Other factors that may be considered include (i) the proposed cost of the qualifying facility; (ii) the general reputation, industry experience, and financial capacity of the private entity; (iii) the proposed design of the qualifying project; (iv) the eligibility of the facility for accelerated selection, review, and documentation timelines under the responsible public entity's guidelines; (v) local citizen and government comments; (vi) benefits to the public; (vii) the private entity's compliance with a minority business enterprise participation plan or good faith effort to comply with the goals of such plan; (viii) the private entity's plans to employ local contractors and residents; and (ix) other criteria that the responsible public entity deems appropriate.</p><p>A responsible public entity shall proceed in accordance with the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to subdivision 1 unless it determines that proceeding in accordance with the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to this subdivision is likely to be advantageous to the responsible public entity and the public, based on (i) the probable scope, complexity, or priority of the project; (ii) risk sharing including guaranteed cost or completion guarantees, added value or debt or equity investments proposed by the private entity; or (iii) an increase in funding, dedicated revenue source or other economic benefit that would not otherwise be available. When the responsible public entity determines to proceed according to the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to this subdivision, it shall state the reasons for its determination in writing. If a state agency is the responsible public entity, the approval of the responsible Governor's Secretary, or the Governor, shall be required before the responsible public entity may enter into a comprehensive agreement pursuant to this subdivision.</p><p>3. Nothing in this chapter shall authorize or require that a responsible public entity obtain professional services through any process except in accordance with guidelines adopted by it that are consistent with the procurement of "professional services" through competitive negotiation as set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4302.2/'>2.2-4302.2</a> and subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4310/'>2.2-4310</a>.</p><p>4. A responsible public entity shall not proceed to consider any request by a private entity for approval of a qualifying project until the responsible public entity has adopted and made publicly available guidelines pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-575.3:1/'>56-575.3:1</a> that are sufficient to enable the responsible public entity to comply with this chapter.</p><p>5. A responsible public entity that is a school board or a county, city, or town may enter into an interim or comprehensive agreement under this chapter only with the approval of the local governing body.</p><p>2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0571'>571</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0292'>292</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0968'>968</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1034'>1034</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0986'>986</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0865'>865</a>; 2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0936'>936</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0764'>764</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0583'>583</a>.</p>
