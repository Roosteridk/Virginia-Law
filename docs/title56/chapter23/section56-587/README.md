The Commission:</p><p>1. Shall establish a reasonable period within which any retail customer may cancel, without penalty or cost, any contract entered into with any person licensed pursuant to this section; and</p><p>2. May adopt other rules and regulations governing the requirements for obtaining, retaining, and renewing a license issued pursuant to this section, and may, as appropriate, refuse to issue a license to, or suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew the license of, any person that does not meet those requirements.</p><p>D.
