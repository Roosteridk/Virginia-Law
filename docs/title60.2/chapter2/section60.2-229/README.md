# § 60.2-229 Wages.

<p>A. "Wages" means all remuneration paid, or which should have been paid, for personal services, including commissions, bonuses, tips, back pay, dismissal pay, severance pay and any other payments made by an employer to an employee during his employment and thereafter and the cash value of all remuneration payable in any medium other than cash. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, wages paid in back pay awards shall be allocated to, and reported as being paid during, the calendar quarter or quarters in which such back pay would have been earned. Severance pay paid at the time of, or subsequent to, separation from employment shall be allocated to the last day of work unless otherwise allocated by the employer. If otherwise allocated, severance pay shall be allocated at a rate not less than the average weekly wage of such employee during the last calendar quarter, and reported as such. Severance pay shall be deducted from any benefits payable after the Commission's receipt of notification of severance pay by the employer pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/60.2-603/'>60.2-603</a>. The reasonable cash value of remuneration payable in any medium other than cash shall be estimated and determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission.</p><p>B.
