# § 46.2-1203 Sale of vehicle at public auction by locality; disposition of proceeds.

<p>If an abandoned vehicle in the possession of a locality or an authorized agent is not reclaimed as provided for in § <a href='/vacode/46.2-1202/'>46.2-1202</a>, the locality or its authorized agent shall, notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/46.2-617/'>46.2-617</a>, sell it at public auction. For the purposes of this article, "public auction," when conducted by any county, city, or town, shall include an Internet sale by auction. The purchaser of the vehicle shall take title to the vehicle free of all liens and claims of ownership of others, shall receive a sales receipt from the sale, and shall be entitled to apply to and receive from the Department a certificate of title and registration card for the vehicle upon submission of the sales receipt, the completed Vehicle Removal Certificate, and the receipt produced by the Department pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/46.2-1202/'>46.2-1202</a>. The sales receipt from the sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking, or dismantling, and in that case no further titling of the vehicle shall be necessary; however, such demolisher shall provide the Department acceptable documentation indicating that the vehicle has been demolished. From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned vehicle the locality or its authorized agent shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the auction, the cost of towing, preserving, and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the abandoned vehicle in custody, and all costs, if any, incurred pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/46.2-1202/'>46.2-1202</a>. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the abandoned vehicle or any person having security interests in the vehicle, as their interests may appear, for 60 days, and then be deposited into the treasury of the locality in which the abandoned vehicle was abandoned.</p><p>1968, c. 421, § 46.1-555.5; 1989, c. 727; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0369'>369</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0241'>241</a>; 2021, Sp.
