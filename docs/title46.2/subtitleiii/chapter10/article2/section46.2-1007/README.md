# § 46.2-1007 Retesting of devices and revocation of approval certificates.

<p>The Superintendent, when having reason to believe that an approved device or equipment for which a certificate of approval has been issued and which is being sold commercially does not, under ordinary conditions of use, comply with the requirements of this chapter, may, after notice to the manufacturer thereof, suspend or revoke the certificate of approval issued therefor, until or unless the device is resubmitted to and retested by an authorized testing agency and is found to meet the requirements of this chapter. If the certificate of approval for such device or equipment has been waived by the Superintendent as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1005/'>46.2-1005</a>, the notice to the manufacturer as provided in this section shall have the effect of making further sales of such device or equipment unlawful in the Commonwealth until such device or equipment has been submitted to the Superintendent and a certificate of approval has been issued in accordance with the procedure established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1005/'>46.2-1005</a>. The Superintendent may, at the time of retest, purchase in the open market and submit to the testing agency one or more sets of the approved device, and if the device fails to meet the requirements of this title, the Superintendent may permanently revoke the certificate of approval of the device. In the discretion of the Superintendent, an approval for the sale and use of any such device may be amended to permit the continued use of such devices already sold but to prohibit further sales of the device.</p><p>Code 1950, § 46-315; 1958, c. 541, § 46.1-313; 1960, c. 125; 1962, c. 146; 1989, c. 727.</p>
