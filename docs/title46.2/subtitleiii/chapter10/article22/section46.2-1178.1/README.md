The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing on-road testing and on-road clean screen program requirements including, but not limited to, collecting data and information necessary to comply with or determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations, random testing of motor vehicle emissions, procedures to notify owners of test results, assessment of civil charges for noncompliance with emissions standards adopted by the Board, and standards for operating the on-road clean screen program, including provisions for the suspension or revocation of any on-road emissions inspection program for failure to act in accordance with the provisions of this article and regulations adopted by the Board.</p><p>B. If an emissions test performed pursuant to this section indicates that a motor vehicle does not meet emissions standards established by the Board, the Board may collect from the owner of the vehicle a civil charge based on actual emissions. The Board shall establish a schedule of civil charges to be collected pursuant to this section. Such civil penalties shall not exceed $450 using 1990 as the base year and adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index.

If the on-road clean screen program indicates that a motor vehicle does not exceed emissions standards adopted by the Board for on-road testing pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1179/'>46.2-1179</a>, then such testing may be considered proof of compliance for the purposes of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1183/'>46.2-1183</a> and may be considered to satisfy the requirements of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1177/'>46.2-1177</a> for a biennial inspection. The Board shall establish criteria under which such testing shall satisfy the requirements of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1183/'>46.2-1183</a>.</p><p>1995, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0836'>836</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0851'>851</a>; 1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0035'>35</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0100'>100</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0710'>710</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0216'>216</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0824'>824</a>.</p>
