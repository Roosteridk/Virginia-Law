Disregard speed limits, while having due regard for safety of persons and property;</p><p>2. Proceed past any steady or flashing red signal, traffic light, stop sign, or device indicating moving traffic shall stop if the speed of the vehicle is sufficiently reduced to enable it to pass a signal, traffic light, or device with due regard to the safety of persons and property;</p><p>3. Park or stop notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter;</p><p>4. Disregard regulations governing a direction of movement of vehicles turning in specified directions so long as the operator does not endanger life or property;</p><p>5. Pass or overtake, with due regard to the safety of persons and property, another vehicle at any intersection;</p><p>6. Pass or overtake with due regard to the safety of persons and property, while en route to an emergency, stopped or slow-moving vehicles, by going to the left of the stopped or slow-moving vehicle either in a no-passing zone or by crossing the highway centerline; or</p><p>7. Pass or overtake with due regard to the safety of persons and property, while en route to an emergency, stopped or slow-moving vehicles, by going off the paved or main traveled portion of the roadway on the right. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, vehicles exempted in this instance will not be required to sound a siren or any device to give automatically intermittent signals.</p><p>B. The exemptions granted to emergency vehicles by subsection A in subdivisions A1, A3, A4, A5, and A6 shall apply only when the operator of such vehicle displays a flashing, blinking, or alternating emergency light or lights as provided in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1022/'>46.2-1022</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1023/'>46.2-1023</a> and sounds a siren, exhaust whistle, or air horn designed to give automatically intermittent signals, as may be reasonably necessary. The exemption granted under subdivision A 2 shall apply only when the operator of such emergency vehicle displays a flashing, blinking, or alternating emergency light or lights as provided in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1022/'>46.2-1022</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1023/'>46.2-1023</a> and either (a) sounds a siren, exhaust whistle, or air horn designed to give automatically intermittent signals or (b) slows the vehicle down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions, yields right-of-way to the driver of another vehicle approaching or entering the intersection from another direction or, if required for safety, brings the vehicle to a complete stop before proceeding with due regard for the safety of persons and property. In addition, the exemptions granted to emergency vehicles by subsection A shall apply only when there is in force and effect for such vehicle either (i) standard motor vehicle liability insurance covering injury or death to any person in the sum of at least $100,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to the limit for one person, to a limit of $300,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and to a limit of $20,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident or (ii) a certificate of self-insurance issued pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-368/'>46.2-368</a>. Such exemptions shall not, however, protect the operator of any such vehicle from criminal prosecution for conduct constituting reckless disregard of the safety of persons and property. Nothing in this section shall release the operator of any such vehicle from civil liability for failure to use reasonable care in such operation.</p><p>C. For the purposes of this section, the term "emergency vehicle" shall mean:</p><p>1.
