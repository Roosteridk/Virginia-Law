# ยง 46.2-410.2 License suspension or revocation by Commissioner; offenses under the laws of other jurisdictions.

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commissioner shall not administratively revoke or suspend the driver's license of any person on the basis of receiving a record of such person's conviction for any offense under the laws of another jurisdiction that would otherwise require the Commissioner to revoke or suspend such person's driver's license unless such offense is substantially similar to an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a county, city, or town ordinance. Whenever the Commissioner is required to determine whether the law of another jurisdiction is substantially similar to the laws of the Commonwealth, or a county, city, or town ordinance, such determination shall be based only on the text of the other jurisdiction's law without reference to the particular circumstances of any conviction under such other jurisdiction's laws. However, if the Commissioner cannot reasonably determine from the text of the other jurisdiction's law whether such law is substantially similar to the laws of the Commonwealth, or a county, city, or town ordinance, the Commissioner may, if available, review a certified copy of the final order of the person's conviction in order to make such determination.</p><p>2017, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0776'>776</a>.</p>
