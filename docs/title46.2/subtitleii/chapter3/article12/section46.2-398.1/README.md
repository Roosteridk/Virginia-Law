# ยง 46.2-398.1 Issuance of restricted driver's privilege to out-of-state licensees.

<p>When the operator of any motor vehicle who is not licensed to drive in Virginia, but who has a valid driver's license from another jurisdiction, is convicted in Virginia of any violation for which license suspension and issuance of a restricted license to a Virginia driver is authorized, the court may issue him a restricted driving privilege in Virginia upon the same conditions as if the person held a valid Virginia license. The court order, and any writing or communication setting forth the person's restricted privilege, shall include clear language indicating that the person is not a licensed Virginia driver.</p><p>2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0493'>493</a>.</p>
