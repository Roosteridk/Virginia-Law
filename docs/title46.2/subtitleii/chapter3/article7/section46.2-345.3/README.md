The fee for the issuance of an original, duplicate, reissue, or renewal identification privilege card is $25.

Any such release shall be in accordance with the requirements of § <a href='/vacode/46.2-208/'>46.2-208</a>.</p><p>H. Any person who uses a false or fictitious name or gives a false or fictitious address in any application for an identification privilege card or knowingly makes a false statement or conceals a material fact or otherwise commits a fraud in any such application is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.
