All annual registration fees required by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/50-73.67/'>50-73.67</a> and penalties that were due before the certificate of limited partnership was canceled and that would have been assessed or imposed to the date of reinstatement if the limited partnership's certificate of limited partnership had not been canceled;</p><p>4.

Upon entry of the order, the existence of the limited partnership shall be deemed to have continued from the date of the cancellation as if cancellation had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the limited partnership or a partner or other agent after the cancellation and before the reinstatement is determined as if cancellation of the limited partnership's existence had never occurred.</p><p>2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0586'>586</a>.</p>
