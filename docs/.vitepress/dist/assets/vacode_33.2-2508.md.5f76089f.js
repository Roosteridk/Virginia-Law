In carrying out this responsibility, the Authority shall, on the basis of a regional consensus whenever possible, set regional transportation policies and priorities for regional transportation projects and, at least once every five years, shall consider for revision and revise as necessary the regional transportation plan. The policies and priorities shall have reducing congestion in Planning District 8 as their primary objective to the greatest extent practicable and shall be guided by performance-based criteria such as the ability to improve travel times, reduce delays, connect regional activity centers, improve safety, improve air quality, and move the most people in the most cost-effective manner. Any obstacles to achieving this objective shall be specified in writing, including any reason relating to the need for cooperation by any locality embraced by (i) the Authority, (ii) the District of Columbia, (iii) the State of Maryland, or (iv) any other regional entity in the metropolitan Washington area.
