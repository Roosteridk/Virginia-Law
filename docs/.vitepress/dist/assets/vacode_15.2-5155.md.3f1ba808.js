Any locality authorized to consider petitions under this article may, by ordinance or resolution not inconsistent with the petition proposing the creation of the authority, create a community development authority, a public body politic and corporate and political subdivision of the Commonwealth. Community development authorities proposed for districts that are within any two or more localities may be formed by concurrent ordinances of each locality, and such localities may contract with one another for administration of the authority. If the boundaries of the proposed community development authority district are located wholly in a town, the owner or owners shall petition the town and need not petition the county and the town may create the authority without action by the county. If the petition for the creation of a community development authority so provides, the ordinance or resolution creating the community development authority may provide for the locality at any time after the creation of the community development authority to adjust the boundaries of the community development authority district to exclude certain land as long as the owners of at least 51 percent of the land area or assessed value of land remaining in the community development authority district after the adjustment petitioned for the creation of the community development authority.</p><p>B. An ordinance or resolution creating a community development authority shall not permit the community development authority to provide services which are provided by, or are obligated to be provided by, any authority already in existence whose charter requires or permits service within the proposed community development district, unless the existing authority first certifies to the governing body that the services provided by the proposed community development authority will not have a negative impact upon the existing authority&#39;s operational or financial condition. Such certification shall not be unreasonably withheld by the existing authority.</p><p>Code 1950, § 15-764.3; 1950, p. 1315; 1962, c. 623, § 15.1-1241; 1972, c. 370; 1973, c. 478; 1993, c. 850; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">402</a>; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">897</a>; 1997, c. 587; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">473</a>.</p>',4),n=[a];function c(h,l,s,d,u,p){return e(),o("div",null,n)}const f=t(r,[["render",c]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
