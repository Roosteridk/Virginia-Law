Awards may be granted for part-time or full-time attendance for no more than one year of study for students enrolled in adult education programs for the high school diploma and preparation programs for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board of Education or the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) credit, and for no more than the minimum number of credit hours required to complete program requirements, except as approved by the Committee for students enrolled in the following approved education programs: (i) an approved career or technical education or training program at a comprehensive community college, or at an accredited career and technical education postsecondary school in the Commonwealth; (ii) a two-year undergraduate comprehensive community college program; (iii) a four-year undergraduate degree program; (iv) a recognized five-year undergraduate degree program; (v) a masters or doctoral level degree program; and (vi) a professional degree program.
