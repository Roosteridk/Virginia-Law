The Commonwealth shall reimburse any county, city or any combination thereof for one-half the cost of construction, enlargement, renovation, purchase or rental of a detention home or other facilities the plans and specifications of which were approved by the Board and the Governor in accordance with the provisions of subsection C of this section.</p><p>B. The construction, renovation, purchase, rental, maintenance and operation of a detention home or other facilities established by a county, city or any combination thereof and the necessary expenses incurred in operating such facilities shall be the responsibility of the county, city or any combination thereof.</p><p>C. The Board shall promulgate regulations to include criteria to serve as guidelines in evaluating requests for such reimbursements and to ensure the geographically equitable distribution of state funds provided for such purpose. Priority funding shall be given to multijurisdictional initiatives. No such reimbursement for costs of construction shall be made, however, unless the plans and specifications, including the need for additional personnel therefor, have been submitted to the Governor and the construction has been approved by him. Such reimbursement shall be paid by the State Treasurer out of funds appropriated to the Department. In the event that a county or city requests and receives financial assistance from other public fund sources outside the provisions of this law, the total financial assistance and reimbursement shall not exceed the total construction cost of the project exclusive of land and site improvement costs, and such funds shall not be considered state funds.</p><p>1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">698</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">840</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">562</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">601</a>.</p>',5),r=[a];function s(c,h,l,d,u,f){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const b=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,b as default};
