An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual&#39;s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p><p>1964, c. 219, § 8.1-201 (25)-(27); 1973, c. 509; 1984, c. 613; 1991, c. 536; 1992, c. 693; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1007</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">353</a>.</p>',13),r=[i];function c(s,h,d,u,l,p){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const g=e(a,[["render",c]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
