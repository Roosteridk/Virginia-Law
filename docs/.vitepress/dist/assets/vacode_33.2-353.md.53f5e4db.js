The Board shall, with the assistance of the Office of Intermodal Planning and Investment, conduct a comprehensive review of statewide transportation needs in a Statewide Transportation Plan setting forth assessment of capacity needs for all corridors of statewide significance, regional networks, and improvements to promote urban development areas established pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/15.2-2223.1/">15.2-2223.1</a>. The assessment shall consider all modes of transportation. Such corridors shall be planned to include multimodal transportation improvements, and the plan shall consider corridor location in planning for any major transportation infrastructure, including environmental impacts and the comprehensive land use plan of the locality in which the corridor is planned. In the designation of such corridors, the Board shall not be constrained by local, district, regional, or modal plans.</p><p>The Statewide Transportation Plan shall be updated as needed but no less than once every four years. The plan shall promote economic development and all transportation modes, intermodal connectivity, environmental quality, accessibility for people and freight, resiliency, and transportation safety.</p><p>B. The Statewide Transportation Plan shall establish goals, objectives, and priorities that cover at least a 20-year planning horizon, in accordance with federal transportation planning requirements. The plan shall include quantifiable measures and achievable goals relating to, but not limited to, congestion reduction and safety, transit and high-occupancy vehicle facility use, job-to-housing ratios, job and housing access to transit and pedestrian facilities, air quality, movement of freight by rail, and per capita vehicle miles traveled. The Board shall consider such goals in evaluating and selecting transportation improvement projects for inclusion in the Six-Year Improvement Program pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/33.2-214/">33.2-214</a>.</p><p>C. The plan shall incorporate the measures and goals of the approved long-range plans developed by the applicable regional organizations. Each such plan shall be summarized in a public document and made available to the general public upon presentation to the Governor and General Assembly.</p><p>D. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this plan assess transportation needs and assign priorities to projects on a statewide basis, avoiding the production of a plan that is an aggregation of local, district, regional, or modal plans.</p><p>E. The plan shall consider and incorporate, where applicable, wildlife corridors and any recommendation of the Wildlife Corridor Action Plan developed pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/29.1-579/">29.1-579</a>.</p><p>1985, c. 320, § 33.1-23.03; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">764</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">772</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">639</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">896</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">670</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">690</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">864</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">871</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">104</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">164</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>; 2021, Sp.
