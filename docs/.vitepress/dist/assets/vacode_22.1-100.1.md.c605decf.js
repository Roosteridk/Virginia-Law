Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">22.1-100</a>, the governing body of any locality may authorize the local treasurer or fiscal officer, by ordinance or resolution, to create a separate escrow account upon the books of the locality for the deposit of that portion of the locality&#39;s appropriation from the lottery proceeds which are designated, pursuant to Item 139 B 4 of Chapter 935 of the 1999 Acts of Assembly or any other state law, for nonrecurring costs incurred by the relevant school division.</p><p>Such nonrecurring costs shall include school construction, additions, infrastructure, site acquisition, renovations, technology, and other expenditures related to modernizing classroom equipment, and debt service payments on school projects completed during the last ten years. Upon adoption of the proper ordinance or resolution, the treasurer or local fiscal officer of the locality shall place such appropriation into a separate lottery proceeds nonrecurring costs escrow account. Under no circumstances shall the escrow account allowed for the school construction grants pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-175.5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">22.1-175.5</a> be used for these deposits.</p><p>B. The escrow account shall be known as the &quot;County/City/Town of _______________ Lottery Proceeds Nonrecurring Costs Fund.&quot; All principal deposited to such fund, together with all income from or attributable to the fund, shall be used solely for (i) construction, additions, renovations, including retrofitting and enlarging public school buildings, infrastructure, including technology infrastructure, and site acquisition for public school buildings and facilities or (ii) debt service payments, or a portion thereof, for any such projects completed in the previous ten years if so designated.</p><p>No disbursement from the fund may be made except upon specific appropriation by the governing body in accordance with applicable law. If a locality establishes such a fund and designates any portion of the funds deposited therein to pay debt service for (i) any general obligation of the locality held by the Virginia Public School Authority or (ii) any Literary Fund loan, the locality shall obtain an opinion of bond counsel that designation of funds to pay debt service on obligations described in clauses (i) and (ii) hereof does not adversely impact the tax-exempt status of such obligations.</p><p>C. All moneys deposited in the fund, including all income from or attributable to such fund, shall be deemed public funds of the locality and shall be subject to all limitations upon deposit and investment provided by general law, including, but not limited to, the Virginia Security for Public Deposits Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4400/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4400</a> et seq.). Income, dividends, distributions, and grants accruing to the fund shall be retained in such fund and shall be expended only in accordance with the terms of this section.</p><p>D. Nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed to authorize a school board or school division to receive, hold or invest funds in its own name, or to expend funds in the absence of a specific appropriation by the governing body of the locality in accordance with applicable law.</p><p>2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">635</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">693</a>.</p>',8),a=[i];function s(c,l,d,h,u,p){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const b=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
