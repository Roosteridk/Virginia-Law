However, a management contract that is not unconscionable between an association directly or indirectly providing assisted living or nursing services to proprietary lessees and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant may not be terminated while a member of the executive board appointed by the declarant continues to serve unless such termination is approved by a vote of a majority of the members of the executive board and a majority vote of the proprietary lessees, other than the declarant.</p><p>This section does not apply to any proprietary lease or any lease the termination of which would terminate the cooperative or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to that lease was included in the cooperative for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section. This section does not apply to any contract, incidental to the disposition of a cooperative interest, to provide to a proprietary lessee for the duration of such proprietary lessee&#39;s life, or for any term in excess of one year, nursing services, medical services, other health-related services, board and lodging, and care as necessary, or any combination of such services. The rule of property law known as the rule restricting unreasonable restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat any provision of the declaration, bylaws, or proprietary leases requiring that the proprietary lessees be parties to such contracts.</p><p>1982, c. 277, § 55-462; 1985, c. 83; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">242</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',4),i=[n];function s(c,l,d,h,p,f){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const y=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
