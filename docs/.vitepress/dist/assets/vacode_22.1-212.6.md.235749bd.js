Enrollment in a public charter school shall be open to any child who is deemed to reside within the relevant school division or, in the case of a regional public charter school, within any of the relevant school divisions, as set forth in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">22.1-3</a>, through a lottery process on a space-available basis, except that in the case of the conversion of an existing public school, students who attend the school and the siblings of such students shall be given the opportunity to enroll in advance of the lottery process. A waiting list shall be established if adequate space is not available to accommodate all students whose parents have requested to be entered in the lottery process. Such waiting list shall also be prioritized through a lottery process and parents shall be informed of their student&#39;s position on the list.</p><p>B. A public charter school shall be administered and managed by a management committee, composed of parents of students enrolled in the school, teachers and administrators working in the school, and representatives of any community sponsors, in a manner agreed to by the public charter school applicant and the local school board. Pursuant to a charter contract, a public charter school may operate free from specified school division policies and state regulations, and, as public schools, shall be subject to the requirements of the Standards of Quality, including the Standards of Learning and the Standards of Accreditation.</p><p>C. Pursuant to a charter agreement, a public charter school shall be responsible for its own operations, including, but not limited to, such budget preparation, contracts for services, and personnel matters as are specified in the charter agreement. A public charter school may negotiate and contract with a school division, the governing body of a public institution of higher education, or any third party for the use of a school building and grounds, the operation and maintenance thereof, and the provision of any service, activity, or undertaking which the public charter school is required to perform in order to carry out the educational program described in its charter. Any services for which a public charter school contracts with a school division shall not exceed the division&#39;s costs to provide such services.</p><p>D. As negotiated by contract, the local school board or the relevant school boards, in the case of regional public charter schools, may allow a public charter school to use vacant or unused properties or real estate owned by the school board. In no event shall a public charter school be required to pay rent for space which is deemed available, as negotiated by contract, in school division facilities. All other costs for the operation and maintenance of the facilities used by the public charter school shall be subject to negotiation between the public charter school and the school division or, in the case of a regional public charter school, between the regional public charter school and the relevant school divisions.</p><p>E. A public charter school shall not charge tuition.</p><p>1998, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">748</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">890</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">631</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1028</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">851</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">530</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">702</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">720</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">645</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">693</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">770</a>.</p>',7),n=[i];function s(l,c,h,p,d,g){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const f=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
