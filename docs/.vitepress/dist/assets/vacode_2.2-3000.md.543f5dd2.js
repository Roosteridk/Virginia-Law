To that end, employees shall be able to discuss freely, and without retaliation, their concerns with their immediate supervisors and management. To the extent that such concerns cannot be resolved informally, the grievance procedure shall afford an immediate and fair method for the resolution of employment disputes that may arise between state agencies and those employees who have access to the procedure under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-3001</a>.</p><p>B.
