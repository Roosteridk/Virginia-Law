Such recovery audit contracts shall be performance-based and shall contain a provision that authorizes the contractor to be paid a percentage of any payment error that is recovered by such contractor. Individual recovery audits shall consist of the review of contracts to identify payment errors made by state agencies to vendors and other entities resulting from (i) duplicate payments, (ii) invoice errors, (iii) failure to apply applicable discounts, rebates, or other allowances, or (iv) any other errors resulting in inaccurate payments. The Department of Accounts shall report on the status and effectiveness of recovery audits, including any savings realized, to the Chairs of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations by January 1 of each year.</p><p>2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">644</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">109</a>.</p>',3),n=[c];function i(s,d,l,p,h,u){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const v=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{_ as __pageData,v as default};
