Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign all or any portion of the tolls and other revenues to be received by the Authority from the ownership and operation of Authority facilities, but shall not convey or mortgage any Authority facilities or any part thereof. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth that may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority.

In addition to the foregoing, any such resolution, trust agreement, or indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
