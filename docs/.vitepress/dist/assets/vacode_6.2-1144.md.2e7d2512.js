A state stock association or state savings bank may be converted into a bank by the amendment of its articles of incorporation in compliance with the procedure established by Title 13.1, provided that such conversion is approved in advance by the Commission. Prior to approving or disapproving a conversion, the Commission shall investigate the application to convert as if it were an application for a certificate of authority to begin a banking business, and approval shall not be granted unless the applicant meets the standards established by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-816</a>. The order granting a certificate of authority to do a banking business shall designate the main office of the savings institution as the main office of the resulting bank, and the resulting bank shall be permitted to operate all branch offices of the savings institution that could have been established de novo by a bank having its main office at such location or which were in operation for at least five years prior to the date of the order permitting conversion. Within one year of the date of a conversion, the resulting bank shall conform its assets and operations to the provisions of law regulating the operation of banks. The Commission may grant such resulting bank additional one-year periods, not to exceed a total of four additional years, in which to conform its assets and operations to the provisions of laws regulating the operation of banks.</p><p>B.
