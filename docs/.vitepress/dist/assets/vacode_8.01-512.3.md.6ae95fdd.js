You may rely on this only for general guidance because the law itself is the final word. (Read the law, § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34-29</a> of the Code of Virginia, for a full explanation. A copy of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34-29</a> is available at the clerk&#39;s office. If you do not understand the law, call a lawyer for help.)</p><p>An employer may take as much as 25 percent of an employee&#39;s disposable earnings to satisfy this garnishment. But if an employee makes the minimum wage or less for his week&#39;s earnings, the employee will ordinarily get to keep 40 times the minimum hourly wage.&quot;</p><p>But an employer may withhold a different amount of money from that above if:</p><p>(1) The employee must pay child support or spousal support and was ordered to do so by a court procedure or other legal procedure. No more than 65 percent of an employee&#39;s earnings may be withheld for support;</p><p>(2) Money is withheld by order of a bankruptcy court; or</p><p>(3) Money is withheld for a tax debt.</p><p>&quot;Disposable earnings&quot; means the money an employee makes after taxes and after other amounts required by law to be withheld are satisfied. Earnings can be salary, hourly wages, commissions, bonuses, or otherwise, whether paid directly to the employee or not. After those earnings are in the bank for 30 days, they are not considered earnings any more.</p><p>If an employee tries to transfer, assign, or in any way give his earnings to another person to avoid the garnishment, it will not be legal; earnings are still earnings.</p><p>An employee cannot be fired because he is garnished for one debt.</p><p>Financial institutions that receive an employee&#39;s paycheck by direct deposit do not have to determine what part of a person&#39;s earnings can be garnished.</p><p>1983, c. 399; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">40</a>; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">379</a>; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP1051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1051</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">55</a>; 2017, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">143</a>.</p>',37),s=[n];function i(_,d,h,l,p,m){return t(),r("div",null,s)}const u=e(a,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,u as default};
