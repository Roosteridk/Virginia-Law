The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess court costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts that the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p><p>B. The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses of the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:</p><ol><li><p>Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of § <a href="/vacode/13.1-732/">13.1-732</a>, <a href="/vacode/13.1-734/">13.1-734</a>, <a href="/vacode/13.1-737/">13.1-737</a> or <a href="/vacode/13.1-738/">13.1-738</a>; or</p></li><li><p>Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p></li></ol><p>C.
