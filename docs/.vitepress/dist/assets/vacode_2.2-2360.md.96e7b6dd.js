The Authority shall develop, subject to approval by the Board, a Virginia Innovation Index (the Index), a comprehensive research and technology strategic plan for the Commonwealth to identify research areas worthy of Commonwealth economic development. The goal of the Index shall be to develop a cohesive and comprehensive framework through which to encourage collaboration between the Commonwealth&#39;s public institutions of higher education, private sector industries, and economic development entities in order to focus on the complete lifecycle of research, development, and commercialization. The framework shall serve as a means to (i) identify the Commonwealth&#39;s key industry sectors in which investments in technology should be made by the Commonwealth; (ii) identify basic and applied research opportunities in these sectors that exhibit commercial promise; (iii) encourage commercialization and economic development activities in the Commonwealth in these sectors; and (iv) help ensure that investments of public funds in the Commonwealth in basic and applied research are made prudently in focused areas for projects with significant potential for commercialization and economic growth in the Commonwealth.</p><p>B.
