In any unlawful detainer case filed under § <a href="/vacode/8.01-126/">8.01-126</a>, if a judge grants the plaintiff a judgment for possession of the premises, upon request of the plaintiff, the judge shall further order that the writ of eviction issue immediately upon entry of judgment for possession.
