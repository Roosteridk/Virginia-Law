An authority shall have the right to acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any real property pursuant to a duly adopted redevelopment or conservation plan, or otherwise only in accordance with this chapter, after the adoption by it of a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the real property described therein is necessary for such public purposes. An authority may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided in Chapter 2 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">25.1-200</a> et seq.) of Title 25.1. In condemnation proceedings evidence may be presented as to the value of the property including but not limited to the owner&#39;s appraisal and the effect that any pending application for a zoning change, special use permit application or variance application may have on the value of the property. The court may also determine whether there has been unreasonable delay in the institution of the proceedings after public announcement by the condemnor of a project that necessitates acquisition by the condemnor of a designated land area consisting of or including the land sought to be condemned. If the court determines that such unreasonable delay has occurred, it shall instruct the commissioners or jurors in such proceedings to allow any damages proved to their satisfaction by the landowner or landowners to have been sustained to his or their land during and because of such delay, in addition to and separately from the fair market value thereof, but such damages shall not exceed the actual diminution if any in fair market value of the land in substantially the same physical condition over the period of the delay.</p><p>B. Prior to the adoption of any redevelopment plan for a redevelopment area pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-49/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36-49</a> or any conservation plan for a conservation area pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-49.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36-49.1</a>, an authority shall send by certified mail, postage prepaid, to the record owner or owners of every parcel of property to be acquired pursuant to such plan, at their last known address as contained in the records of the treasurer, the current real estate tax assessment records, or the records of such other officer responsible for collecting taxes in that locality, a notice advising such owner that (i) the property owned by such owner is proposed to be acquired, (ii) such owner will have the right to appear before the local governing body and present testimony with respect to the proposed redevelopment or conservation area, and (iii) such owner will have the right to appear in any condemnation proceeding instituted to acquire the property and present any defense which such owner may have to the taking. Such notice shall not be the basis for eligibility for relocation benefits. At the time it makes its price offer, the authority shall also provide to the property owner a copy of the appraisal of the fair market value of such property upon which the authority has based the amount offered for the property, which appraisal shall be prepared by a real estate appraiser licensed in accordance with Chapter 20.1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">54.1-2009</a> et seq.) of Title 54.1.</p><p>C. In all such cases the proceedings shall be according to the provisions of Chapter 2 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">25.1-200</a> et seq.) of Title 25.1, so far as they can be applied to the same. No real property belonging to the city, the county, the Commonwealth or any other political subdivision thereof may be acquired without its consent.</p><p>1938, p. 453; Michie Code 1942, § 3145(12); 1958, c. 518; 1972, cc. 466, 782; 1989, c. 593; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">880</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1029</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">729</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">272</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">940</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">586</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">784</a>.</p>',5),n=[i];function s(h,l,c,p,d,f){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
