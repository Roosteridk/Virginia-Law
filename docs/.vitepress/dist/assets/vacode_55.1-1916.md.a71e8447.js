Acquisition or reacquisition of such a leasehold interest by the owner of the reversion or remainder does not cause a merger of the leasehold and fee simple interests unless all leasehold interests in the condominium are thus acquired or reacquired.</p><p>F. Wherever this section requires a legal description by metes and bounds of land that is submitted pursuant to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, such requirement shall be deemed satisfied by any legally sufficient description and shall be deemed to require a legally sufficient description of any easements that are submitted pursuant to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, as appropriate. In the case of each such easement, the declaration shall contain the following:</p><ol><li><p>A description of the permitted use or uses.</p></li><li><p>If less than all of those entitled to the use of all of the units may utilize such easement, a statement of the relevant restrictions and limitations on utilization.</p></li><li><p>If any persons other than those entitled to the use of the units may utilize such easement, a statement of the rights of others to utilization of the easement.</p></li></ol><p>G. Wherever this section requires a legal description by metes and bounds of land that is submitted pursuant to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, an added requirement shall be a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be tenants in common or joint tenants with any other persons and a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be life tenants. No units shall be situated on any such lands, however, and the declaration shall describe the nature of the unit owners&#39; estate in such lands. No such lands shall be shown on the same plat or plats showing other portions of the condominium but shall be shown instead on separate plats.</p><p>1974, c. 416, § 55-79.54; 1975, c. 415; 1977, c. 428; 1982, c. 545; 1993, c. 667; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">32</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">520</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',19),s=[n];function r(l,h,d,c,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const b=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
