As used in this section, &quot;warranty registration card&quot; means a card or similar device that is provided to the purchaser of personal, family, or household goods with a statement that the purchaser&#39;s return of the warranty registration card shortly after purchase of the goods is a condition precedent to warranty coverage and performance.</p><p>B. Unless any requirement that the purchaser of personal, family, or household goods return a warranty registration card as a condition precedent to warranty coverage and performance is conspicuously disclosed in any advertising and marketing materials that reference the goods&#39; warranty, a seller may not condition the coverage or performance of a warranty upon the return by the purchaser of a warranty registration card, or provide that the duration of a warranty is dependent upon the return by the purchaser of a warranty registration card.</p><p>C. This section does not prohibit the use of warranty registration cards where a seller suggests use of the card as one possible means of proof of the date the goods were purchased. Any such suggestion to the purchaser shall include notice that failure to return the card will not affect rights under the warranty, if the purchaser can establish with reasonable certainty the date the goods were purchased.</p><p>D.
