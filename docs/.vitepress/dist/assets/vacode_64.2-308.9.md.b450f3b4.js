The value of the beneficial interest of a spouse shall be the entire fair market value of any property held in trust if the decedent was the settlor of the trust, if the trust is held for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse during the surviving spouse&#39;s lifetime, and if the terms of the trust meet the following requirements:</p><p>(1) During the lifetime of the surviving spouse, the trust is controlled by the surviving spouse or one or more trustees who are non-adverse parties;</p><p>(2) The trustee shall distribute to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse the entire net income of the trust at least annually;</p><p>(3) The trustee is permitted to distribute to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse out of the principal of the trust such amounts and at such times as the trustee, in its discretion, determines for the health, maintenance, and support of the surviving spouse; and</p><p>(4) In exercising discretion, the trustee may be authorized or required to take into consideration all other income assets and other means of support available to the surviving spouse.</p><p>b. To the extent that the partial or contingent interest is dependent upon the occurrence of any contingency that is not subject to the control of the surviving spouse and that is not subject to valuation by reference to the mortality and annuity tables set forth in §§ <a href="/vacode/55.1-501/">55.1-501</a> through <a href="/vacode/55.1-506/">55.1-506</a>, the contingency will be conclusively presumed to result in the lowest possible value passing to the surviving spouse.</p><p>c.
