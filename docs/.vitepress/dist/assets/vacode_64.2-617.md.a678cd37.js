A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-616</a> and does so in good faith reliance (i) on the registration, (ii) on this article, and (iii) on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary&#39;s representative, or on other information available to the registering entity.
