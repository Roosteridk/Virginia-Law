No person shall engage in the activities of a dealer as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-4100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">54.1-4100</a> without first obtaining a permit from the chief law-enforcement officer of each county, city, or town in which he proposes to engage in business.</p><p>B.
