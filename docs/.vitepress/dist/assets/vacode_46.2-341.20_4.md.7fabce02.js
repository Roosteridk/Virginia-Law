Within 30 days of receiving notification from the Department that retesting is necessary, the affected commercial learner&#39;s permit holder or commercial driver&#39;s license holder must make an appointment or otherwise schedule to take the next available test. If the commercial learner&#39;s permit holder or commercial driver&#39;s license holder fails to make an appointment within 30 days, the Department shall disqualify his commercial learner&#39;s permit or commercial driver&#39;s license. If the driver fails either the knowledge or skills test or does not take the test, the Department shall disqualify his commercial learner&#39;s permit or commercial driver&#39;s license.
