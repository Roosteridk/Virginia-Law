Each plan shall be conducted either by or through (i) a nonstock corporation organized pursuant to the laws of this Commonwealth or (ii) a foreign nonstock corporation that is subject to regulation and licensing under the laws of its domiciliary jurisdiction that are substantially similar to those provided by this chapter.</p><p>B.

The nonstock corporation shall give notice of the petition to its contract holders and participating dentists or optometrists. The Commission shall not approve the change of status unless it is satisfied that the financial condition of the nonstock corporation and the proposed method of operation and manner of doing business enable the nonstock corporation to meet its contractual obligations to all subscribers and that the nonstock corporation has otherwise complied with the requirements of this chapter. The Commission shall (i) consider, among other things, the sufficiency of the contingency reserve required under subsection E and (ii) subject the nonstock corporation, notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1700/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-1700</a>, to the requirements of Chapter 17 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1700/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-1700</a> et seq.).
