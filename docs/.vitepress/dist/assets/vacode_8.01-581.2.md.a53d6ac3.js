The request shall be forwarded by the party making the request to the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Virginia with a copy of the Motion for Judgment and a copy of all responsive pleadings. A copy of the request shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, and a copy shall be sent to all counsel of record. The request shall include the name of the judge to whom the case is assigned, if any. Upon receipt of such request, the Supreme Court shall select the panel members as provided in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-581.3:1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-581.3:1</a> and shall designate a panel within sixty days after receipt of the request.
