Joint petitions shall:</p><ol><li><p>State whether the purposes for which the district was formed have been substantially achieved;</p></li><li><p>State whether all obligations incurred by the district have been fully paid;</p></li><li><p>Describe the benefits that can be expected from the abolition of the district; and</p></li><li><p>Request each affected local governing body to abolish the district.</p></li></ol><p>B. Upon receipt of such a petition, each local governing body, in considering the abolition of the district, shall use the standards and procedures described in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-2001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">33.2-2001</a> mutatis mutandis, except that all interested persons who either reside on or who own real property within the boundaries of the district shall have the right to appear and show cause why the district should not be abolished.</p><p>C.
