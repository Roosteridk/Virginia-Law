The Department may allow such reports to be filed electronically. Such reports shall identify the names and addresses of the persons within the Commonwealth to whom the shipments were made and the quantities of tobacco products shipped, by type of product and brand. The Tax Commissioner may authorize any manufacturer to file such reports for a period less frequently than monthly when, in the opinion of the Tax Commissioner, doing so would improve the efficiency of the administration of the tax imposed by this article. If a manufacturer is allowed to file other than on a monthly basis, each such report shall be due no later than the twentieth day of the month that immediately follows the close of the reporting period. Each such report shall contain the same information as required herein for monthly reporting.</p><p>2010, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0191" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">191</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">804</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">381</a>.</p>',3),i=[n];function s(h,c,l,p,f,d){return t(),o("div",null,i)}const _=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
