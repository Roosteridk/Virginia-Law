The Commission is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this section. However, the Commission may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:</p><ol><li><p>Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;</p></li><li><p>Has substantial insurance operations in the United States but not in the Commonwealth; or</p></li><li><p>Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and the Commonwealth, but the Commission has determined pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections B and F that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.</p></li></ol><p>An insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the Commission make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor pursuant to this section.</p><p>B. In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the Commission shall identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The Commission may determine that the Commission is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in the Commonwealth. However, the Commission may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The Commission shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:</p><ol><li><p>The place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that holds the largest share of the internationally active insurance group&#39;s written premiums, assets, or liabilities;</p></li><li><p>The place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;</p></li><li><p>The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;</p></li><li><p>Whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system that the Commission determines to be:</p></li></ol><p>a. Substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of the Commonwealth; or</p><p>b. Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and</p><ol start="5"><li>Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the Commission with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.</li></ol><p>However, a regulatory official identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in subdivisions 1 through 5, and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commission&#39;s regulatory authority under this section shall not be impaired. To the extent that the Commission acknowledges a regulatory official from another jurisdiction as a group-wide supervisor and in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in (i) the internationally active insurance group&#39;s insurers domiciled in the Commonwealth holding the largest share of the group&#39;s premiums, assets, or liabilities or (ii) the Commonwealth being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group, the Commission may make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for such an internationally active insurance group pursuant to subsection B.</p><p>D. Pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1332/">38.2-1332</a>, the Commission is authorized to collect from any insurer registered pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1329/">38.2-1329</a> all information necessary to determine whether the Commission may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the Commission may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the Commission, the Commission shall notify the insurer registered pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1329/">38.2-1329</a> and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have not less than 30 days to provide the Commission with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The Commission shall publish in any manner it considers appropriate and on its website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the Commission has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the Commission.</p><p>E. If the Commission is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the Commission is authorized to engage in any of the following group-wide supervision activities:</p><ol><li>Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:</li></ol><p>a. The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and</p><p>b. Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;</p><ol start="2"><li>Request, from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the Commission&#39;s supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:</li></ol><p>a. Governance, risk assessment, and management;</p><p>b. Capital adequacy; and</p><p>c. Material intercompany transactions;</p><ol start="3"><li><p>Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of such internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;</p></li><li><p>Communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1333/">38.2-1333</a>, through supervisory colleges as set forth in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1332.1/">38.2-1332.1</a> or otherwise;</p></li><li><p>Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1329/">38.2-1329</a>, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the Commission&#39;s role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in the Commonwealth is doing business in the Commonwealth or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in the Commonwealth; and</p></li><li><p>Engage in other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated above, as considered necessary by the Commission.</p></li></ol><p>F. If the Commission acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the NAIC is the group-wide supervisor, the Commission is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor, provided that:</p><ol><li><p>The Commission&#39;s cooperation is in compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth; and</p></li><li><p>The regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the Commission&#39;s activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the Commission is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.</p></li></ol><p>G. The Commission is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1329/">38.2-1329</a>, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official&#39;s role as group-wide supervisor.</p><p>H. Each registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the necessary traveling and other expenses incurred by the Commission for its participation in the administration of this section. The Commission may retain at the registered insurer&#39;s expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts reasonably necessary to assist in the administration of this section. Any persons so retained shall be under the direction and control of the Commission and shall act in a purely advisory capacity. The Commission may establish a regular assessment to the insurer for the payment of these expenses. If an assessment is required by this subsection, it shall be collected by the Commission and paid directly into the state treasury and credited to the &quot;Bureau of Insurance Special Fund — State Corporation Commission&quot; for the maintenance of the Bureau of Insurance as provided in subsection B of § <a href="/vacode/38.2-400/">38.2-400</a>.</p><p>2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">692</a>.</p>',26),r=[a];function s(l,h,u,c,p,d){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const f=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
