Furthermore, no penalty shall be imposed on any such owner or operator for operation of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer after the expiration of a period fixed for the inspection thereof, over the most direct route between the place where such vehicle is kept or garaged and an official inspection station for the purpose of having it inspected pursuant to an appointment with such station.</p><p>Motor vehicles owned and operated by persons on active duty with the United States armed forces who are Virginia residents stationed outside the Commonwealth at the time the inspection expires may be operated on the highways of the Commonwealth while persons on active duty are on leave, provided such vehicle displays a valid inspection sticker issued by another state.</p><p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;service in the armed services of the United States&quot; includes active duty service with the regular armed forces of the United States or the National Guard or other reserve component.</p><p>2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">582</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">722</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">523</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">283</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">67</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">250</a>.</p>',5),a=[s];function n(h,c,l,d,f,p){return t(),i("div",null,a)}const m=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
