Part of the cooperative may be conveyed, and all or part of the cooperative may be subjected to a security interest, by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes in the association, including a simple majority of the votes allocated to cooperative interests not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action. If fewer than all the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest, then all the proprietary lessees of those units, or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated, must agree in order to convey those units or limited common elements or subject them to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association.</p><p>B. An agreement to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications of such an agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and such ratifications must be recorded in every county or city in which a portion of the cooperative is situated and is effective only upon recordation.</p><p>C. The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections A and B. After such approval, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.</p><p>D.
