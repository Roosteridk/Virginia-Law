A business firm shall be eligible for a credit against the taxes imposed by Articles 2 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-320</a> et seq.), 6 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-360</a> et seq.), and 10 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-400/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-400</a> et seq.) of Chapter 3, Chapter 12 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-1200</a> et seq.), Article 1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-2500</a> et seq.) of Chapter 25, or Article 2 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-2620/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-2620</a> et seq.) of Chapter 26, in an amount equal to 65 percent of the value of the money, property, professional services, and contracting services donated by the business firm during its taxable year to neighborhood organizations for programs approved pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-439.20</a>.

No tax credit shall be granted to any business firm for donations to a neighborhood organization providing job training or education for individuals employed by the business firm. Any tax credit not usable for the taxable year the donation was made may be carried over to the extent usable for the next five succeeding taxable years or until the full credit has been utilized, whichever is sooner. Credits granted to a partnership, electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation, or limited liability company shall be allocated to their individual partners, shareholders, or members, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.</p><p>C.

The certification shall identify the type and value of the donation received, the business firm making the donation, and the tax credit percentage to be used in determining the amount of the tax credit. The certification shall also include any written agreement under which a business firm accepts a tax credit of less than 65 percent for a donation.</p><p>1981, c. 629, § 63.1-324; 1982, c. 178; 1984, c. 720; 1986, c. 407; 1989, c. 310; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">279</a>; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">77</a>; 1997, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">229</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">640</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">890</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">909</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">747</a>, § 63.2-2003; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">585</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">851</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">370</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">731</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">842</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">56</a>.</p>',6),n=[o];function l(s,c,h,f,g,d){return r(),a("div",null,n)}const v=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{b as __pageData,v as default};
