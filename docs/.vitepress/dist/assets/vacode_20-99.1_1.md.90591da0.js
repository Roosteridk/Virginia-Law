A defendant in such suits may accept service of process by signing the proof of service before any officer authorized to administer oaths. This proof of service shall, when filed with the papers in the suit, have the same effect as if it had been served upon the defendant by a person authorized to serve process. In addition, service of process may be accepted or waived by any party, upon voluntary execution of a notarized writing specifying an intent to accept or waive any particular process, or by a defendant by filing an answer in the suit. Such notarized writing may be provided in the clerk&#39;s office of any circuit court and may be signed by such party to the proceedings before any clerk or deputy clerk of any circuit court, under oath, or may be drafted and filed by counsel or a pro se party in the proceeding, and shall, when filed with the papers in the suit, have the same effect as if the process specified had been personally served upon the defendant by a person authorized to serve process. For a suit for a no-fault divorce under subdivision A (9) of § <a href="/vacode/20-91/">20-91</a>, any such waiver may occur within a reasonable time prior to or after the suit is filed, provided that a copy of the complaint is attached to such waiver, or is otherwise provided to the defendant, and the final decree of divorce as proposed by the complainant is signed by the defendant. The court may enter any order or decree without further notice unless a defendant has filed an answer in the suit.</p><p>B. When service is accepted pursuant to this section by a nonresident person out of the Commonwealth, such service shall have the same effect as an order of publication duly executed.</p><p>C. Any process served outside the Commonwealth executed in such manner as provided for in this section is validated.</p><p>1988, c. 583; 1989, c. 562; 1992, c. 563; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">133</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">237</a>.</p>',5),n=[o];function s(c,d,h,p,f,u){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const y=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{v as __pageData,y as default};
