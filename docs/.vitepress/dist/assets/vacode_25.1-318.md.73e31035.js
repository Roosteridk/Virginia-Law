The authorized condemnor shall reimburse the owner for his fees and costs charged by a lienholder, including filing fees and attorney fees, incurred in filing the owner&#39;s petition.</p><p>2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">940</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">586</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">835</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">593</a>; 2022, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">735</a>.</p>',8),i=[a];function s(h,p,c,d,f,l){return t(),o("div",null,i)}const g=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
