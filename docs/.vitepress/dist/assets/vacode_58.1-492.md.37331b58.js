The amount of such addition to the tax shall be reported and paid at the time of filing the individual income tax return or the fiduciary income tax return for the taxable year.</p><p>The amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:</p><ol><li><p>The amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of an individual referred to in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-490/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-490</a> F, relating to income from farming) of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year, or if no return was filed, ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of individuals referred to in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-490/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-490</a> F, relating to income from farming) of the tax for such year; or 100 percent of the tax shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, whichever is less, over</p></li><li><p>The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for such payment.</p></li></ol><p>B.
