The amount for any increased interest or debt service costs shall be (i) determined in accordance with the criteria established by the state agency and (ii) paid only if the dwelling acquired by the state agency was encumbered by a bona fide mortgage that was a valid lien on such dwelling for not less than 180 days immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of such dwelling; and</p></li><li><p>Reasonable expenses incurred by such displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the comparable replacement dwelling, but not including prepaid expenses.</p></li></ol><p>B.
