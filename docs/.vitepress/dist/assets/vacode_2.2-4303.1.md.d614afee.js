A contract for architectural or professional engineering services relating to multiple projects may be awarded by a public body, provided (i) the projects require similar experience and expertise, (ii) the nature of the projects is clearly identified in the Request for Proposal, and (iii) the contract is limited to a term of one year or when the cumulative total project fees reach the maximum authorized in this section, whichever occurs first.</p><p>Such contracts may be renewable for three additional terms at the option of the public body. Any unused amounts from one contract term shall not be carried forward to any additional term, except as otherwise provided by the Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act (§ <a href="/vacode/23.1-1000/">23.1-1000</a> et seq.). The fair and reasonable prices as negotiated shall be used in determining the cost of each project performed.</p><p>The sum of all projects performed in a contract term shall not exceed $10 million, and the fee for any single project shall not exceed $2.5 million.</p><p>B. Competitive negotiations for such architectural or professional engineering services contracts may result in awards to more than one offeror, provided (i) the Request for Proposal so states and (ii) the public body has established procedures for distributing multiple projects among the selected contractors during the contract term. Such procedures shall prohibit requiring the selected contractors to compete for individual projects based on price.</p><p>2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">570</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">760</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">776</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">294</a>; 2017, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">343</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">555</a>; 2018, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">461</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">431</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">618</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">852</a>; 2022, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">504</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">505</a>.</p>',6),o=[n];function l(c,s,g,p,h,f){return r(),t("div",null,o)}const m=e(a,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
