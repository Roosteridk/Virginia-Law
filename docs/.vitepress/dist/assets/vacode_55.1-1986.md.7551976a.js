Prior to issuing the temporary order, the Common Interest Community Board shall give notice of the proposal to issue a temporary order to the person. Every temporary order shall include in its terms a provision that upon request a hearing will be held promptly to determine whether it becomes permanent.</p><p>1974, c. 416, § 55-79.100; 1975, c. 415; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">467</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',5),n=[i];function s(d,m,l,p,h,c){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const g=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
