The income and principal of the Fund shall be used only and exclusively (i) for the Department&#39;s direct and indirect costs associated with the processing of an application to issue, reissue, amend, or modify any permit to land apply, distribute, or market sewage sludge or industrial wastes, the administration and management of the Department&#39;s sewage sludge and industrial wastes land application programs, including monitoring and inspecting, and the Department of Conservation and Recreation&#39;s costs for implementation of the sewage sludge application program and (ii) to reimburse localities with duly adopted ordinances providing for the testing and monitoring of the land application of sewage sludge or solid or semisolid industrial wastes. The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the moneys deposited in the Fund. No part of the Fund, either principal or interest earned thereon, shall revert to the general fund of the state treasury.</p><p>H. All persons holding or applying for a permit authorizing the land application of sewage sludge shall provide to the Board written evidence of financial responsibility, which shall be available to pay claims for cleanup costs, personal injury, and property damages resulting from the transportation, storage or land application of sewage sludge. The Board shall, by regulation, establish and prescribe mechanisms for meeting the financial responsibility requirements of this section.</p><p>I. Any county, city or town may adopt an ordinance that provides for the testing and monitoring of the land application of sewage sludge within its political boundaries to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p>J. The Department, upon the timely request of any individual to test the sewage sludge at a specific site, shall collect samples of the sewage sludge at the site prior to the land application and submit such samples to a laboratory. The testing shall include an analysis of the (i) concentration of trace elements, (ii) coliform count, and (iii) pH level. The results of the laboratory analysis shall be (a) furnished to the individual requesting that the test be conducted and (b) reviewed by the Department. The person requesting the test and analysis of the sewage sludge shall pay the costs of sampling, testing, and analysis.</p><p>K. At least 100 days prior to commencing land application of sewage sludge at a permitted site, the permit holder shall deliver or cause to be delivered written notification to the chief executive officer or his designee for the local government where the site is located. The notice shall identify the location of the permitted site and the expected sources of the sewage sludge to be applied to the site. This requirement may be satisfied by providing a list of all available permitted sites in the locality at least 100 days prior to commencing the application at any site on the list. This requirement shall not apply to any application commenced prior to October 10, 2005. If the site is located in more than one county, the notice shall be provided to all jurisdictions where the site is located.</p><p>L. The permit holder shall deliver or cause to be delivered written notification to the Department at least 14 days prior to commencing land application of sewage sludge at a permitted site. The notice shall identify the location of the permitted site and the expected sources of the sewage sludge to be applied to the site.</p><p>M. The Department shall randomly conduct unannounced site inspections while land application of sewage sludge is in progress at a sufficient frequency to determine compliance with the requirements of this section, § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.19:3.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62.1-44.19:3.1</a>, or regulations adopted under those sections.</p><p>N. Surface incorporation into the soil of sewage sludge applied to cropland may be required when practicable and compatible with a soil conservation plan meeting the standards and specifications of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service.</p><p>O. The Board shall develop regulations specifying and providing for extended buffers to be employed for application of sewage sludge (i) to hay, pasture, and forestlands; or (ii) to croplands where surface incorporation is not practicable or is incompatible with a soil conservation plan meeting the standards and specifications of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service. Such extended buffers may be included by the Department as site specific permit conditions pursuant to subsection E, as an alternative to surface incorporation when necessary to protect odor sensitive receptors as determined by the Department or the local monitor.</p><p>P. The Board shall adopt regulations requiring the payment of a fee for the land application of sewage sludge, pursuant to permits issued under this section. The person land applying sewage sludge shall (i) provide advance notice of the estimated fee to the generator of the sewage sludge unless notification is waived, (ii) collect the fee from the generator, and (iii) remit the fee to the Department as provided for by regulation. The fee shall be imposed on each dry ton of sewage sludge that is land applied in the Commonwealth. The regulations shall include requirements and procedures for:</p><ol><li><p>Collection of fees by the Department;</p></li><li><p>Deposit of the fees into the Fund; and</p></li><li><p>Disbursement of proceeds by the Department pursuant to subsection G.</p></li></ol><p>Q. The Department, in consultation with the Department of Health, the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, shall establish and implement a program to train persons employed by those local governments that have adopted ordinances, pursuant to this section, to test and monitor the land application of sewage sludge.

To the extent feasible, the program shall emphasize in-field instruction and practical training. Persons employed by local governments shall successfully complete such training before the local government may request reimbursement from the Board for testing and monitoring of land application of sewage sludge performed by the person. The completion of training shall not be a prerequisite to the exercise of authority granted to local governments by any applicable provision of law.</p><p>The Department may:</p><ol><li><p>Charge attendees a reasonable fee to recover the actual costs of preparing course materials and providing facilities and instructors for the program. The fee shall be reimbursable from the Fund established pursuant to this section; and</p></li><li><p>Request and accept the assistance and participation of other state agencies and institutions in preparing and presenting the course of training established by this subsection.</p></li></ol><p>R. Localities, as part of their zoning ordinances, may designate or reasonably restrict the storage of sewage sludge based on criteria directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and the environment. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, a locality may by ordinance require that a special exception or a special use permit be obtained to begin the storage of sewage sludge on any property in its jurisdiction, including any area that is zoned as an agricultural district or classification. Such ordinances shall not restrict the storage of sewage sludge on a farm as long as such sludge is being stored (i) solely for land application on that farm and (ii) for a period no longer than 45 days. No person shall apply to the State Health Commissioner or the Department of Environmental Quality for a permit, a variance, or a permit modification authorizing such storage without first complying with all requirements adopted pursuant to this subsection.</p><p>1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">288</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">831</a>; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">197</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">396</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">459</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">593</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">390</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">881</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">927</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">929</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">42</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">104</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">677</a>.</p>',25),r=[o];function s(l,p,d,c,h,g){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const m=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
