The Board is authorized to collect from any applicant for approval of an oil discharge contingency plan and from any operator seeking acceptance of evidence of financial responsibility fees sufficient to meet, but not exceed, the costs of the Board related to implementation of § <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.34:15/">62.1-44.34:15</a> as to an applicant for approval of an oil discharge contingency plan and of § <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.34:16/">62.1-44.34:16</a> as to an operator seeking acceptance of evidence of financial responsibility. The Board shall establish by regulation a schedule of fees that takes into account the nature and type of facility and the effect of any prior professional certification or federal review or approval on the level of review required by the Board. All such fees received by the Board shall be used exclusively to implement the provisions of this article.</p><p>B. Fees charged an applicant should reflect the average time and complexity of processing approvals in each of the various categories.</p><p>C. When adopting regulations for fees, the Board shall take into account the fees charged in neighboring states, and the importance of not placing existing or prospective industries in the Commonwealth at a competitive disadvantage. Within six months of receipt of any federal moneys that would offset the costs of implementing this article, the Board shall review the amount of fees set by regulation to determine the amount of fees which should be refunded. Such refunds shall only be required if the fees plus the federal moneys received for the implementation of the program under this article as it applies to facilities exceed the actual cost to the Board of administering the program.</p><p>D. On October 1, 1995, and every two years thereafter, the Board shall make an evaluation of the implementation of the fee programs and provide this evaluation in writing to the Senate Committees on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and on Finance and Appropriations; and the House Committees on Appropriations, Chesapeake and Its Tributaries, and Finance.</p><p>1990, c. 917; 1992, c. 345.</p>',6),r=[n];function s(c,l,d,h,f,p){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const v=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,v as default};
