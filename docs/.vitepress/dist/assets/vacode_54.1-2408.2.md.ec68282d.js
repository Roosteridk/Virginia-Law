A board shall conduct an investigation and review an application for reinstatement after revocation to determine whether there are causes for denial of the application. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by clear and convincing evidence that he is safe and competent to practice. The reinstatement of a certificate, registration, permit, or license shall require the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members at the hearing. In the discretion of the board, such reinstatement may be granted without further examination.</p><p>2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">753</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">762</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">365</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">11</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">96</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">423</a>.</p>',3),o=[n];function s(c,l,f,h,p,d){return r(),t("div",null,o)}const v=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
