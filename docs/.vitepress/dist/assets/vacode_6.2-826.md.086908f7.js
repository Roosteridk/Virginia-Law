When a conversion of a state bank into a national banking association under the authority granted by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-825</a> becomes effective, all the property of the former state bank, including all its right, title, and interest in and to all property of every kind, whether real, personal, or mixed, and things in action, and every right, privilege, interest, and asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing, belonging, or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it, shall immediately, by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed, be vested in and become the property of such national bank. The national bank shall have, hold, and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as if the same were possessed, held, or enjoyed by the state bank. The national bank shall be deemed to be a continuation of the entity and identity of the state banking corporation that is operated under and pursuant to federal law.</p><p>B. All the rights, obligations, and relations of the converted state bank to or in respect to (i) any person, estate, creditor, depositor, trustee, or beneficiary of any trust and (ii) any executorship or trusteeship or other trust or fiduciary function, including appointments, designations, and nominations, shall remain unimpaired. The national bank, as of the beginning of its corporate existence, shall, by operation of this section, succeed to all such rights, obligations, relations, and trusts, including appointments, designations, and nominations, and the duties and liabilities connected therewith. The national bank shall execute and perform each and every such trust and relation in the same manner as if such national bank had itself assumed the trust or relation, including the obligations and liabilities connected therewith.</p><p>C. If the state banking corporation is acting as administrator, coadministrator, executor, coexecutor, trustee, or cotrustee of, or in respect to, any estate or trust being administered under the laws of the Commonwealth, such relation, as well as any other or similar fiduciary relation, and all rights, privileges, duties, and obligations connected therewith, shall remain unimpaired and shall continue in such national bank from and as of the beginning of its corporate existence, irrespective of (i) the date when any such relation may have been created or established, (ii) the date of any trust agreement relating thereto, or (iii) the date of the death of any testator or decedent whose estate is being so administered.</p><p>D. Nothing done in connection with a conversion from a state to a national bank, in respect to any such executorship, trusteeship, or similar fiduciary relation, shall (i) be deemed to be or to effect, under the laws of the Commonwealth, a renunciation or revocation of any letters of administration or letters testamentary pertaining to such relation or a removal or resignation from any such executorship or trusteeship or (ii) be deemed to be of the same effect as if the executor or trustee had died or otherwise become incompetent to act. Nothing in this section shall in any way affect any provisions of law if a national bank becomes a state bank.</p><p>Code 1950, § 6-19; 1966, c. 584, § 6.1-36; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>.</p>',6),r=[i];function s(l,c,h,d,f,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const m=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{b as __pageData,m as default};
