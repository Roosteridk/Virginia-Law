Any such subpoena duces tecum shall be on a form approved by the Committee on District Courts, signed by the attorney as if a pleading and shall include the attorney&#39;s address.

If objection is made, the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and served shall not be entitled to the requested production, inspection or testing, except pursuant to an order of the court, but may, upon notice to the person to whom the subpoena was directed, move for an order to compel production, inspection or testing. Upon such timely motion, the court may quash, modify or sustain the subpoena.</p><p>1956, c. 555; 1979, c. 668; 1984, c. 500; 1986, c. 160; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">813</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">335</a>.</p>',6),n=[r];function i(u,c,d,h,p,l){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
