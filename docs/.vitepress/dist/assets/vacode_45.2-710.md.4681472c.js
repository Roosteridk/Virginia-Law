Each underground coal mine shall have a roof control plan approved by the Chief. Each plan shall include (i) a minimum standard for adequately controlling the roof, face, and ribs; (ii) a description of mining methods used; (iii) a listing and specification of roof and rib support materials; (iv) instruction for the installation of temporary and permanent roof supports; (v) a description of any pillar recovery methods; (vi) applicable drawings that demonstrate the width of each opening, each roof support installation sequence, and each pillar recovery sequence; and (vii) any additional requirements deemed necessary by the Chief. The initial submission of any roof control plan shall include maps of mine projections, overlying and underlying mine workings, coal contours, and surface contours. If changes are to be made in the mining system that necessitate any change in the roof control plan, the plan shall be revised and approved by the Chief prior to implementing the new mining system.</p><p>B. The Chief shall, where he deems necessary, prescribe adequate minimum standards for systematic support of mine roof, suitable to the roof conditions and mining system of each mine. Such standards shall be incorporated into an approved roof control plan for the mine.</p><p>C. Failure to comply with the approved roof control plan for the mine shall constitute a violation of this section.</p><p>D. The approved roof control plan shall be posted conspicuously at the mine and a copy shall be available at each working section of the mine.</p><p>E. The minimum standards and plan shall provide for temporary support at all active workings, without regard to natural condition.</p><p>F. If the minimum standards do not afford adequate protection, such additional supports shall be installed as necessary. Such additional supports shall be described in the plan.</p><p>G. This section shall not apply to any roof control system installed prior to January 27, 1988, so long as the support system continues to effectively control the roof, face, and ribs.</p><p>Code 1950, § 45-68.2; 1954, c. 191; 1966, c. 594, § 45.1-40; 1975, c. 520; 1978, c. 729; 1984, c. 590; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28</a>, § 45.1-161.109; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">256</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">826</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">862</a>; 2021, Sp.
