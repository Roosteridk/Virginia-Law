In a proceeding for an elective share, the following are applied first to satisfy the elective-share amount and to reduce or eliminate any contributions due from the decedent&#39;s probate estate and recipients of the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others:</p><ol><li><p>Amounts excluded from the augmented estate under subdivision B 1 of § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.9/">64.2-308.9</a> that passed to the surviving spouse and amounts that passed to the surviving spouse at the decedent&#39;s death pursuant to the decedent&#39;s exercise of a power of appointment over property not included in the augmented estate;</p></li><li><p>Amounts included in the augmented estate under § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.5/">64.2-308.5</a> that pass or have passed to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession and amounts included in the augmented estate under § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.7/">64.2-308.7</a>; and</p></li><li><p>The marital property portion of amounts included in the augmented estate under § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.8/">64.2-308.8</a>.</p></li></ol><p>B. The marital property portion under subdivision A 3 is computed by multiplying the value of the amounts included in the augmented estate under § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.8/">64.2-308.8</a> by the percentage of the augmented estate set forth in the schedule in subsection B of § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.4/">64.2-308.4</a> appropriate to the length of time the spouse and the decedent were married to each other.</p><p>C. If, after the application of subsection A, the elective share amount is not fully satisfied, amounts included in the decedent&#39;s net probate estate, other than assets passing to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession, and in the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others under subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 b of § <a href="/vacode/64.2-308.6/">64.2-308.6</a> are applied first to satisfy the unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount. The decedent&#39;s net probate estate and that portion of the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others are so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount is apportioned among the recipients of the decedent&#39;s net probate estate and of that portion of the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein.</p><p>D. If, after the application of subsections A and C, the elective share amount is not fully satisfied, the remaining portion of the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others is so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount is apportioned among the recipients of the remaining portion of the decedent&#39;s non-probate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein.</p><p>E. The unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount as determined under subsection C or D is treated as a general pecuniary bequest.</p><p>2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">187</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">269</a>; 2018, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">301</a>.</p>',8),r=[s];function i(h,d,p,c,l,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const v=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
