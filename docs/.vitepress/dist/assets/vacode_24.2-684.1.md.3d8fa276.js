The individual shall be a qualified voter of the county or city and shall file, with the petition copy, a statement giving his name; residence address and, if different, his mailing address; and the name of the organization, if any, which he represents in circulating the petition.

If the court or authority finds that the filed petitions are invalid for any cause, the petitions and the signatures on them shall be invalid for all purposes. The invalidity of one or more signatures on a petition page shall not be cause to invalidate the entire petition page. If the circulators of the petitions fail to file within the nine-month period provided in subdivision 6, the petitions and the signatures on them shall be invalid for all purposes.</p></li></ol><p>1993, c. 996, § 24.1-165.3; 1993, c. 641; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">232</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">252</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">333</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">520</a>.</p>',5),a=[n];function l(h,s,c,f,d,u){return t(),i("div",null,a)}const g=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
