If a condominium contains any convertible land or is an expandable condominium, then the declaration shall not allocate undivided interests in the common elements on the basis of par value unless the declaration:</p><ol><li><p>Prohibits the creation of any units not substantially identical to the units depicted on the plats and plans recorded pursuant to subsections A and B of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1920/">55.1-1920</a>; or</p></li><li><p>Prohibits the creation of any units not described pursuant to subdivision B 6 of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1916/">55.1-1916</a>, in the case of convertible lands, and subdivision C 12 of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1916/">55.1-1916</a>, in the case of additional land, and contains from the outset a statement of the par value that shall be assigned to every such unit that may be created.</p></li></ol><p>B.

But simultaneously with the recording of such plats and plans, the declarant shall execute and record an amendment to the declaration reallocating undivided interests in the common elements so that the units depicted on such plats and plans shall be allocated undivided interests in the common elements on the same basis as the units depicted on the plats and plans recorded simultaneously with the declaration pursuant to subsections A and B of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1920/">55.1-1920</a>.</p><p>C. If all of a convertible space is converted into common elements, including limited common elements, then the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to such space shall then appertain to the remaining units, being allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common elements. The principal officer of the unit owners&#39; association, or such other officer as the condominium instruments may specify, shall forthwith prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced by such conversion.</p><p>D. In the case of a leasehold condominium, if the expiration or termination of any lease causes a contraction of the condominium that reduces the number of units, then the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to any units withdrawn from the condominium shall then appertain to the remaining units, being allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common elements. The principal officer of the unit owners&#39; association, or such other officer as the condominium instruments may specify, shall forthwith prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced by such contraction.</p><p>1974, c. 416, § 55-79.56; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',7),s=[i];function r(c,l,d,h,m,u){return t(),n("div",null,s)}const v=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
