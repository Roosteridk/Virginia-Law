The notice shall include a copy of parts of the maps and plans required under § <a href="/vacode/45.2-542/">45.2-542</a> that show the mine workings or projected mine workings that are within 500 feet of the well.

Each operator who files such a petition shall mail copies of the petition, maps, and plans by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the well operator and the Gas and Oil Inspector no later than the day of filing. The Gas and Oil Inspector and the operator of the gas or oil well or vertical ventilation hole shall have standing to object to any petition filed under this section. Such objection shall be filed within 10 days following the date such petition is filed.</p><p>D. Procedures for safely mining in proximity to or through a coalbed methane well or a vertical ventilation hole developed for methane drainage in a mine shall be addressed in the bleeder system plan for that mine required by § <a href="/vacode/45.2-837/">45.2-837</a>.</p><p>1990, c. 92, § 45.1-92.1; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28</a>, § 45.1-161.121; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">256</a>; 2021, Sp.
