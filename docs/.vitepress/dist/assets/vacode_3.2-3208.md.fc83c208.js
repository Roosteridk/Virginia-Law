In determining the reasonableness of prices to be paid or charged in any market for any grade, quantity, or class of milk, the Commission shall be guided by all pertinent economic factors relevant to production, processing, and distribution of milk as they affect the public interest in maintaining an adequate supply of milk within the Commonwealth, including compliance with all sanitary regulations in force in such market, necessary operation, processing, storage, and delivery charges, the prices of other foods, and the welfare of the general public. The Commission may adopt a formula incorporating these economic factors that will adjust automatically the prices to be paid producers or associations of producers by distributors in any market, and then provide for the automatic adjustment of resale prices according to the result obtained by the use of this formula.
