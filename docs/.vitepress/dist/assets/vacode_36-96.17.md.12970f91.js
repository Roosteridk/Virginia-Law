A civil action under this subsection shall be commenced no later than the expiration of 18 months after the date of the occurrence or the termination of the alleged discriminatory housing practice.</p><p>B. Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this chapter, or that any group of persons has been denied any of the rights granted by this chapter and such denial raises an issue of general public importance, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in the appropriate circuit court for appropriate relief.</p><p>C.
