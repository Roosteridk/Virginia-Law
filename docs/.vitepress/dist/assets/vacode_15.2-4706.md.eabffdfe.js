Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 (§ <a href="/vacode/58.1-3229/">58.1-3229</a> et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1, the tax shall be levied upon the assessed fair market value of the taxable real property. The rate of the special improvements tax shall not be more than $0.20 per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3203/">58.1-3203</a>; however, if all the owners in any district so request, this limitation on rate shall not apply. Such special improvements taxes shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the locality&#39;s taxes are collected, and the proceeds shall be kept in a separate account. All revenues received by the locality pursuant to such taxes shall be paid over to the district commission for its use pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/15.2-4705/">15.2-4705</a>.</p><p>1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">587</a>.</p>',3),i=[r];function n(l,c,p,h,d,u){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const v=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
