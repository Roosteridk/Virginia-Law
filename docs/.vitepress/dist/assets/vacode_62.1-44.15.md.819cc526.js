If the evidence presented by the petitioner in support of the petition is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order, the Board shall immediately set aside the order, provide a formal hearing, and make such petitioner a party. If the Board denies the petition, the Board shall provide notice to the petitioner and make available to the public the reasons for such denial, and the petitioner shall have the right to judicial review of such decision under § <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.29/">62.1-44.29</a> if he meets the requirements thereof.</p><p>(8g) To issue special orders for violations of this chapter to persons constructing or operating any natural gas transmission pipeline greater than 36 inches inside diameter.

In conjunction with this, the Board, when considering proposals for waste treatment facilities, is to consider the feasibility of combined or joint treatment facilities and is to ensure that the approval of waste treatment facilities is in accordance with the water quality management and pollution control plan in the watershed or basin as a whole. In making such determinations, the Board is to seek the advice of local, regional, or state planning authorities.</p><p>(14) To establish requirements for the treatment of sewage, industrial wastes, and other wastes that are consistent with the purposes of this chapter; however, no treatment shall be less than secondary or its equivalent, unless the owner can demonstrate that a lesser degree of treatment is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p><p>(15) To promote and establish requirements for the reclamation and reuse of wastewater that are protective of state waters and public health as an alternative to directly discharging pollutants into waters of the state. The requirements shall address various potential categories of reuse and may include general permits and provide for greater flexibility and less stringent requirements commensurate with the quality of the reclaimed water and its intended use. The requirements shall be developed in consultation with the Department of Health and other appropriate state agencies. This authority shall not be construed as conferring upon the Board any power or duty duplicative of those of the State Board of Health.</p><p>(16) To establish and implement policies and programs to protect and enhance the Commonwealth&#39;s wetland resources. Regulatory programs shall be designed to achieve no net loss of existing wetland acreage and functions.

The Board shall seek and obtain advice and guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in implementing these policies and programs.</p><p>(17) To establish additional procedures for obtaining a Virginia Water Protection Permit pursuant to §§ <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:20/">62.1-44.15:20</a> and <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:22/">62.1-44.15:22</a> for a proposed water withdrawal involving the transfer of water resources between major river basins within the Commonwealth that may impact water basins in another state. Such additional procedures shall not apply to any water withdrawal in existence as of July 1, 2012, except where the expansion of such withdrawal requires a permit under §§ <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:20/">62.1-44.15:20</a> and <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:22/">62.1-44.15:22</a>, in which event such additional procedures may apply to the extent of the expanded withdrawal only.
