The modified net premiums for a policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards, such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then-present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision 1 over subdivision 2, as follows:</p><ol><li><p>A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due. However, the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy.</p></li><li><p>A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.</p></li></ol><p>B.
