A human trafficking assessment requires the collection of information necessary to determine:</p><ol><li><p>The immediate safety needs of the child;</p></li><li><p>The protective and rehabilitative services needs of the child and the child&#39;s family that will deter abuse and neglect; and</p></li><li><p>Risk of future harm to the child.</p></li></ol><p>C.

Reports or complaints for which a human trafficking assessment is completed shall not be entered into the central registry contained in § <a href="/vacode/63.2-1515/">63.2-1515</a>.</p><p>F.
