If the applicant is less than 19 years old and cannot otherwise provide proof of Virginia residency, the Commissioner may accept proof of the applicant&#39;s parent&#39;s or guardian&#39;s Virginia residency. Any minor providing proper evidence of the solemnization of his marriage or a certified copy of a court order of emancipation shall not be required to provide the parent&#39;s certification of residency.
