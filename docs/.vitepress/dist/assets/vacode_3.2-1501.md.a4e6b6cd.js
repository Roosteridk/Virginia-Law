The Cotton Board shall be composed of eight members appointed by the Governor, each of whom shall be a resident of Virginia and a producer in Virginia. The Governor shall be guided in his appointments from nominations made by the following agricultural organizations: (i) the Virginia Cotton Growers Association, Inc.; (ii) the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation; and (iii) any other organization within the Commonwealth that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a certified cotton grower organization representing Virginia producers pursuant to guidelines authorized by the Cotton Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2118). Each such agricultural organization may nominate producers from each production area. The Governor shall appoint a producer residing in each such production area. If no producer resides in a particular production area, the Governor shall appoint a qualified producer from any other production area. Each agricultural organization shall submit nominations for each available position before the expiration of the member&#39;s term for which the nomination is being provided. If said agricultural organizations fail to provide the nominations, the Governor may appoint other nominees that meet the foregoing criteria.
