The fee shall be ordered as a part of court costs collected by the clerk, deposited into the account of the treasurer of the county or city and shall be used by the local sheriff&#39;s office to defray the costs of processing arrested persons into local or regional jails. If processing costs are incurred by a regional jail rather than a local sheriff&#39;s office, the fees collected pursuant to such ordinance may be used by the regional jail to defray the costs of processing arrested persons. Where costs are incurred by a sheriff&#39;s office and a regional jail the fees collected pursuant to such ordinance may be divided proportionately as determined by the local governing body or bodies, between the sheriff&#39;s office and the regional jail. Where costs are incurred by a police department for booking or fingerprinting services, the fees collected pursuant to such ordinance may be divided proportionately as determined by the local governing body or bodies, between the sheriff&#39;s office and the police department.</p><p>2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">840</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">623</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">300</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">664</a>.</p>',3),n=[t];function s(c,d,l,f,h,p){return o(),r("div",null,n)}const b=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
