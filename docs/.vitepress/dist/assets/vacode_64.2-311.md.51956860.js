In addition to any other right or allowance under this article, a surviving spouse of a decedent who was domiciled in the Commonwealth is entitled to a homestead allowance of $20,000. If there is no surviving spouse, each minor child of the decedent is entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $20,000, divided by the number of minor children.</p><p>B. The homestead allowance has priority over all claims against the estate, except the family allowance and the right to exempt property.</p><p>C. The homestead allowance is in lieu of any share passing to the surviving spouse or minor children by the decedent&#39;s will or by intestate succession; provided, however, if the amount passing to the surviving spouse and minor children by the decedent&#39;s will or by intestate succession is less than $20,000, then the surviving spouse or minor children are entitled to a homestead allowance in an amount that when added to the property passing to the surviving spouse and minor children by the decedent&#39;s will or by intestate succession, equals the sum of $20,000.</p><p>D.
