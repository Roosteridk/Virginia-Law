Upon receipt of the petition, the court shall, if all owners of lots within such subdivision are not before the court, enter an order of publication under the provisions of subdivision A 3 of § <a href="/vacode/8.01-316/">8.01-316</a>, making the owners of all lots not owned by petitioners parties to the cause, which shall then be docketed and set for trial on the chancery side of the court. Should the court, after hearing evidence and argument of counsel, find that the streets and roads in the subdivision require maintenance in excess of that provided for with the road maintenance funds specified in the covenants to permit emergency vehicles ready access to the residents of the subdivision to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare, the court may increase the fees required for road maintenance to the extent reasonably necessary to permit emergency vehicles ready access to the residents of the subdivision.
