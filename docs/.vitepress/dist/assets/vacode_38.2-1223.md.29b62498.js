Every subscriber of a domestic assessable reciprocal shall execute a subscriber&#39;s agreement and power of attorney setting forth the rights, privileges and obligations of the subscriber as an underwriter and as a policyholder, and the powers and duties of the attorney. Every subscriber of a nonassessable reciprocal may execute a subscriber&#39;s agreement and power of attorney setting forth the rights, privileges, and obligations of the subscriber as an underwriter and as a policyholder, and the powers and duties of the attorney. If a nonassessable reciprocal does not require execution of a subscriber&#39;s agreement and power of attorney, the reciprocal shall include on its policies a statement that the subscriber shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the then current subscriber&#39;s agreement and power of attorney on file with the attorney and the Commission, a copy of which shall be provided to each subscriber with each new or renewal policy, and each subscriber shall by operation of law be bound by such subscriber&#39;s agreement and power of attorney as if individually executed. Without additional execution, notice or acceptance, every subscriber of a reciprocal agrees to be bound by any modification of the terms of the power of attorney and subscriber&#39;s agreement which is jointly made by the attorney and the subscribers&#39; advisory committee pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1224/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-1224</a>, and which shall be on file with the attorney and the Commission.
