However, when a petition is filed by a person other than a parent having custody of the child, the standby guardian shall be appointed only with the consent of the qualified parent unless the court finds that such consent cannot be given for medical reasons.</p><p>The order shall specify the triggering event and shall provide that the authority of the standby guardian is effective (a) upon receipt by the standby guardian of (1) a determination of incompetence of the parent, (2) a certificate of death of the parent, (3) evidence of the detention, incarceration, or deportation of the parent connected to an immigration action, or (4) the earlier of clause (1), (2), or (3) or (b) if so requested in the petition, upon receipt by the standby guardian of a written consent of the qualified parent and filing of the consent with the court.

Failure to file within the time specified shall be grounds for the court to rescind the authority of the standby guardian sua sponte or upon petition of any person but all acts undertaken by the standby guardian on behalf of and in the interests of the child shall be valid and enforceable.</p><p>1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">829</a>; 2021, Sp.
