If the assessment exceeds the proper amount, the Tax Commissioner shall order that the applicant be exonerated from the payment of so much as is erroneously or improperly charged, if not already paid into the state treasury, and, if paid, that it be refunded to him. If the assessment is less than the proper amount, the Tax Commissioner shall order that the applicant pay the proper taxes. He shall refund to the taxpayer any exempt funds which have been improperly collected. The Tax Commissioner shall refrain from collecting a contested assessment until he has made a final determination under this section unless he determines that collection is in jeopardy. In any action on an application for correction, the Tax Commissioner shall state in writing the facts and law supporting the action on such application.</p><p>For all outstanding liabilities upon which an application for correction has been filed, interest shall accrue on the outstanding liability at the rate prescribed by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-15</a> until nine months from the date of assessment.
