However, nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent a common source information company from requiring, as a condition of participation in or use of such common source information, that licensees providing information through such company disclose the nature of the brokerage relationship with the client, including, but not limited to, whether the licensee is acting as (i) an independent contractor, (ii) a limited service agent, (iii) a standard agent, or (iv) an agent as provided in the brokerage agreement. A common source information company may, but shall not be obligated to, require disclosure of a standard agency relationship, and may adopt rules providing that absent any disclosure, a licensee providing information through such company may be assumed to be acting as a standard agent. A common source information company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make information about the nature of brokerage relationships available to its participants and to settlement service it provides including, without limitation, title insurance companies, lenders, and settlement agents.</p><p>1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">741</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">813</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">627</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">750</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">334</a>.</p>',3),r=[i];function s(c,l,m,g,h,d){return o(),a("div",null,r)}const f=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
