There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund that is a subfund of the Commonwealth Port Fund, known as the Port Opportunity Fund, referred to in this section as &quot;the Fund.&quot; The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. All funds appropriated for such purpose and any gifts, donations, grants, bequests, and other funds received on its behalf shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Executive Director of the Virginia Port Authority or his designee.

Such determination shall be made in writing by the Secretary of Transportation to the Executive Director of the Authority. Requests to transfer such revenues shall be made by August 30 of the ensuing fiscal year.</p><p>C.
