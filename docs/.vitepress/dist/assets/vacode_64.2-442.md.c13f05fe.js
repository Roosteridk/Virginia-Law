Information that may be received, preserved in confidence until death, and reported as indicated is limited to the name, social security or any other individual-identifying number established by law, address, and date and place of birth of the testator, and the intended place of deposit or safekeeping of the instrument pending the death of the testator. The Secretary of the Commonwealth, at the request of the authorized person, may cause the information he receives about execution of any international will to be transmitted to the registry system of another jurisdiction as identified by the testator, if that other system adheres to rules protecting the confidentiality of the information similar to those established in the Commonwealth.</p><p>1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">443</a>, § 64.1-96.11; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">85</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">614</a>.</p>',3),o=[r];function s(l,h,d,c,f,m){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const _=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
