For purposes of this section, &quot;lawful survey&quot; means the boundaries of any land, including submerged lands, held under a special grant or compact as required by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28.2-1200</a>, such boundaries having been determined by generally accepted surveying methods and evidenced by a plat or map thereof recorded in the circuit court clerk&#39;s office of the county or city in which the land lies.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, where sand or other material is placed upon state-owned beds of the bays, rivers, creeks, or shores of the sea channelward of the mean low-water mark as part of the performance of a properly permitted beach nourishment, storm protection, or dredging project undertaken by a public body, and the public has an established right of use and maintenance upon the adjacent land above the mean low-water mark, whether such public right is established before or after the sand or other material is placed, such placement shall not be deemed a severance or taking of, or otherwise to have impaired, an adjacent landowner&#39;s riparian or littoral rights, and the newly created land channelward of the former mean low-water mark shall be deemed natural accretion for purposes of ownership, but such ownership shall be subject to the public&#39;s same right of use and maintenance upon the newly created land as previously existed on the adjacent land above the mean low-water mark.
