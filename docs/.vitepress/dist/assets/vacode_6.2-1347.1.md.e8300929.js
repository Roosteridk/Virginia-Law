The board may hold a special meeting to receive member input regarding the potential conversion. It is within the board&#39;s discretion to determine the type, number, duration, and location of any special meeting. Before taking a final vote on a conversion proposal, the board shall review and consider all written comments and any other member input received at any special meeting. The conversion resolution shall state that the board has reviewed and considered all such comments and input and has determined affirmatively that the conversion is in the best interests of the members.</p></li><li><p>Subsequent to the written comment period, the credit union shall adopt, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of its board of directors, a conversion proposal consistent with this section. The credit union shall notify the Commissioner of the board&#39;s approval of the proposal, and shall file an application in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-1118</a> and pay the accompanying fee in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-1202</a>.

The notice must include a prominent statement that the conversion will be decided by a vote of members eligible to vote on the proposal under the credit union&#39;s bylaws and that the affirmative votes of two-thirds of those eligible members voting are required for approval unless the articles of incorporation require a greater or lesser vote in which case the notice shall specify that percentage. However, in no case shall the percentage vote be less than a majority of the members voting notwithstanding what is specified in the articles of incorporation. The notice shall clearly inform the members that they may vote at the members&#39; meeting on the proposal or submit the written ballot included with the notice. Each eligible member is entitled to one vote. With the notice, members shall be provided plain language disclosures of material facts and information to be used as a basis for reaching an informed decision to vote on the conversion, including but not limited to a summary of all information required by subdivision B 2.

Such vote shall be by secret ballot and shall be conducted by an independent entity, which may be such credit union&#39;s legal or accounting firm.</p></li><li><p>Following approval of the conversion by the members, the conversion shall become effective when (i) the Commission shall have approved it and (ii) any amendment of the articles of incorporation of the credit union necessary to effect the conversion shall have become effective.</p></li></ol><p>C.
