A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.</p><p>(b) A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.</p><p>(c) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.3A-104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.3A-104</a> (a).
