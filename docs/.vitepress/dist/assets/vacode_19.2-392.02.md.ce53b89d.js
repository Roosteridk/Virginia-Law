A qualified entity may request the Department of State Police to conduct a national criminal background check on any provider who is employed by such entity. No qualified entity may request a national criminal background check on a provider until such provider has:</p><ol><li><p>Been fingerprinted; and</p></li><li><p>Completed and signed a statement, furnished by the entity, that includes (i) his name, address, and date of birth as it appears on a valid identification document; (ii) a disclosure of whether or not the provider has ever been convicted of or is the subject of pending charges for a criminal offense within or outside the Commonwealth, and if the provider has been convicted of a crime, a description of the crime and the particulars of the conviction; (iii) a notice to the provider that the entity may request a background check; (iv) a notice to the provider that he is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report, to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in any such report, and to obtain a prompt determination as to the validity of such challenge before a final determination is made by the Department; and (v) a notice to the provider that prior to the completion of the background check the qualified entity may choose to deny the provider unsupervised access to children or the elderly or disabled for whom the qualified entity provides care.</p></li></ol><p>C. Upon receipt of (i) a qualified entity&#39;s written request to conduct a background check on a provider, (ii) the provider&#39;s fingerprints, and (iii) a completed, signed statement as described in subsection B, the Department shall make a determination whether the provider has been convicted of or is the subject of charges of a barrier crime. To conduct its determination regarding the provider&#39;s barrier crime information, the Department shall access the national criminal history background check system, which is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is based on fingerprints and other methods of identification, and shall access the Central Criminal Records Exchange maintained by the Department. If the Department receives a background report lacking disposition data, the Department shall conduct research in whatever state and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data. The Department shall make reasonable efforts to respond to a qualified entity&#39;s inquiry within 15 business days.</p><p>D. Any background check conducted pursuant to this section for a provider employed by a private entity shall be screened by the Department of State Police. If the provider has been convicted of or is under indictment for a barrier crime, the qualified entity shall be notified that the provider is not qualified to work or volunteer in a position that involves unsupervised access to children or the elderly or disabled.</p><p>E. Any background check conducted pursuant to this section for a provider employed by a governmental entity shall be provided to that entity.</p><p>F. In the case of a provider who desires to volunteer at a qualified entity and who is subject to a national criminal background check, the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may each charge the provider the lesser of $18 or the actual cost to the entity of the background check conducted with the fingerprints.</p><p>G. The failure to request a criminal background check pursuant to subsection B shall not be considered negligence per se in any civil action.</p><p>2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">860</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">217</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">758</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">770</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">809</a>; 2018, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">810</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">617</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">860</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">861</a>; 2021, Sp.
