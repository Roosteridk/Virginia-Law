Any locality may (i) acquire or otherwise obtain control of or (ii) establish, maintain, operate, extend and enlarge: waterworks, sewerage, gas works (natural or manufactured), electric plants, public mass transportation systems, stormwater management systems and other public utilities within or outside the limits of the locality and may acquire within or outside its limits in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-1800</a> whatever land may be necessary for acquiring, locating, establishing, maintaining, operating, extending or enlarging waterworks, sewerage, gas works (natural or manufactured), electric plants, public mass transportation systems, stormwater management systems and other public utilities, and the rights-of-way, rails, pipes, poles, conduits or wires connected therewith, or any of the fixtures or appurtenances thereof. As required by subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-1800</a>, this section expressly authorizes a county to acquire real property for a public use outside its boundaries.</p><p>The locality may also prevent the pollution of water and injury to waterworks for which purpose its jurisdiction shall extend to five miles beyond the locality. It may make, erect and construct, within or near its boundaries, drains, sewers and public ducts and acquire within or outside the locality in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-1800</a> so much land as may be necessary to make, erect, construct, operate and maintain any of the works or plants mentioned in this section.</p><p>In the exercise of the powers granted by this section, localities shall be subject to the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-102/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">25.1-102</a> to the same extent as are corporations. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to confer upon any locality the power of eminent domain with respect to any public utility owned or operated by any other political subdivision of this Commonwealth. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to exempt localities from the provisions of Chapters 20 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-2000</a> et seq.), 22 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-2200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-2200</a> et seq.) and 23 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-2300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-2300</a> et seq.) of Title 46.2.</p><p>B.

In no event, however, shall a locality be required to hold a referendum in order to provide gas or electric service to its own facilities. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, a locality may acquire public utility facilities or provide services to customers of a public utility with the consent of the public utility. No city or town which provided electric service as of January 1, 1994, shall be required to hold such a referendum prior to the acquisition of a public utility&#39;s facilities, equipment or appurtenances used for the production, transmission or distribution of electric power or to the provision of services to customers of a public utility. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to (a) create a property right or property interest or (b) affect or impair any existing property right or property interest of a public utility.</p><p>C.
