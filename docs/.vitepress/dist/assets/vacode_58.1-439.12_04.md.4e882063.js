The term shall also include the Virginia Housing Development Authority.</p><p>&quot;Housing choice voucher&quot; means tenant-based assistance by a housing authority pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1437f et seq.</p><p>&quot;Participating landlord&quot; means any person engaged in the business of the rental of dwelling units who is (i) subject to the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (§ <a href="/vacode/55.1-1200/">55.1-1200</a> et seq.) and (ii) performing obligations under a contract with a housing authority relating to the rental of qualified housing units.</p><p>&quot;Qualified housing unit&quot; means a dwelling unit that is located in an eligible census tract for which a portion of the rent is paid by a housing authority, which payment is pursuant to a housing choice voucher program.</p><p>B. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, but before January 1, 2025, a participating landlord renting a qualified housing unit shall be eligible for a credit against the tax levied pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/58.1-320/">58.1-320</a> or <a href="/vacode/58.1-400/">58.1-400</a> in an amount equal to 10 percent of the fair market value of the rent for the unit, computed for that portion of the taxable year in which the unit was rented by such landlord to a tenant participating in a housing choice voucher program. The Department of Housing and Community Development shall administer and issue the tax credit under this section. If (i) the same parcel of real property contains four or more dwelling units and (ii) the total number of qualified housing units on the parcel in the relevant taxable year exceeds 25 percent of the total dwelling units on the parcel, then the tax credit under this section shall apply only to a limited number of qualified housing units with regard to such parcel of real property, with the limited number being equal to 25 percent of the total dwelling units on such parcel of real property in the taxable year.</p><p>C. The Department of Housing and Community Development shall issue tax credits under this section on a fiscal year basis.

If the amount of credit issued by the Department of Housing and Community Development for a taxable year exceeds the landlord&#39;s tax liability imposed by this chapter for such taxable year, then the amount that exceeds the tax liability may be carried over for credit against the income taxes of the participating landlord in the next five taxable years or until the total amount of the tax credit issued has been taken, whichever is sooner. Credits granted to a partnership, limited liability company, or electing small business corporation (S corporation) shall be allocated to the individual partners, members, or shareholders, respectively, in proportion to their ownership or interest in such business entities.</p><p>G.
