The industrial and economic development of localities included in or adjacent to such military installations and the tax revenues of the Commonwealth will be seriously affected by the manner in which such areas are returned to nonmilitary uses and to the tax rolls, no provision having been made therefor. The proper development of such areas industrially and otherwise is required so that local governments may derive revenues with which to render necessary services to their citizens and so that industrial development; job creation; and housing, recreational, commercial, educational and other economic and social development may be fostered and stimulated to prevent the creation of blighted areas in the Commonwealth with resultant injury to all. The creation by this chapter and operation of authorities pursuant to this chapter are governmental functions of the gravest concern to the Commonwealth and the need for this enactment being a matter of legislative policy such need is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.</p><p>Code 1950, § 15-937; 1954, c. 645; 1962, c. 623, § 15.1-1320; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">740</a>; 1997, c. 587; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">869</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">887</a>.</p>',3),n=[i];function s(c,l,h,d,f,p){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const v=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,v as default};
