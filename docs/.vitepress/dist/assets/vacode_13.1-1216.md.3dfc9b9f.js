Except to the extent otherwise provided in this chapter, the articles of trust, or the governing instrument of the business trust, the sole trustee or a majority of the trustees may amend the articles of trust of a business trust at any time to add or change a provision that is required or permitted in the articles, or to delete a provision not required in the articles. An amendment to the articles of trust may delete the name and address of the initial registered agent or registered office, if a statement of change described in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-1221</a> is on file with the Commission.</p><p>B. A business trust amending its articles of trust shall file with the Commission articles of amendment setting forth:</p><ol><li><p>The name of the business trust;</p></li><li><p>The text of each amendment adopted;</p></li><li><p>The date of each amendment&#39;s adoption; and</p></li><li><p>A statement that the amendment was adopted in accordance with the articles of trust and the governing instrument of the business trust.</p></li></ol><p>C. If the Commission finds that the articles of amendment comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of amendment.</p><p>D. An amendment to the articles of the trust does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the business trust, a proceeding to which the business trust is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than beneficial owners of the business trust. An amendment changing a business trust&#39;s name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the business trust in its former name.</p><p>2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">621</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">101</a>.</p>',7),r=[n];function o(h,d,l,c,f,m){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const g=e(i,[["render",o]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
