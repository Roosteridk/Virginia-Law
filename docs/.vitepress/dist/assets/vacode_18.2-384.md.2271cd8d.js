Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to this article, the court in term or in vacation shall forthwith examine the book alleged to be obscene.

If an appearance is entered and an answer filed, the court shall order the proceeding set on the calendar for a prompt hearing.

If he finds the book obscene, the court shall order the clerk of court to enter judgment that the book is obscene, but the court, in its discretion, may except from its judgment a restricted category of persons to whom the book is not obscene.</p><p>K.
