In calculating the return on investment, the Commission shall use the natural gas utility&#39;s weighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and equity, based on its regulatory capital structure used in determining the natural gas utility&#39;s base rates in effect during the construction period of the eligible system expansion, applied to eligible expansion investment. The investment, as adjusted for the reserve for depreciation and accumulated deferred income taxes, shall be multiplied by the weighted average cost of capital to determine the return on investment;</p></li><li><p>A revenue conversion factor, which factor, including income taxes and an allowance for bad debt expense, shall be applied to the required operating income resulting from the eligible system infrastructure expansion costs;</p></li><li><p>Education and outreach expense.
