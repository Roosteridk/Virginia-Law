The notice shall include the following information:</p><ol><li><p>The name and date of death of the decedent;</p></li><li><p>The name, address, and telephone number of a personal representative or a proponent of a will;</p></li><li><p>The mailing address of the clerk of the court in which the personal representative qualified or the will was probated;</p></li><li><p>A statement as follows: &quot;This notice does not mean that you will receive any money or property&quot;;</p></li><li><p>A statement as follows: &quot;If personal representatives qualified on this estate, unless otherwise specifically exempted under Virginia law, they are required by law to file an inventory with the commissioner of accounts within four months after they qualify in the clerk&#39;s office, to file an account within 16 months of their qualification, and to file additional accounts within 16 months from the date of their last account period until the estate is settled. If you make written request therefor to the personal representatives, they must mail copies of these documents (not including any supporting vouchers, but including a copy of the decedent&#39;s will) to you at the same time the inventory or account is filed with the commissioner of accounts unless (i) you would take only as an heir at law in a case where all of the decedent&#39;s probate estate is disposed of by will or (ii) your gift has been satisfied in full before the time of such filing. Your written request may be made at any time; it may relate to one specific filing or to all filings to be made by the personal representative, but it will not be effective for filings made prior to its receipt by a personal representative. A copy of your request may be sent to the commissioner of accounts with whom the filings will be made. After the commissioner of accounts has completed work on an account filed by a personal representative, the commissioner files it and a report thereon in the clerk&#39;s office of the court wherein the personal representative qualified. If you make written request therefor to the commissioner before this filing, the commissioner must mail a copy of this report and any attachments (excluding the account) to you on or before the date that they are filed in the clerk&#39;s office&quot;; and</p></li><li><p>The mailing address of the commissioner of accounts with whom the inventory and accounts must be filed by the personal representatives, if they are required.</p></li></ol><p>D. Within 30 days after the date of qualification or admission of the will to probate, a personal representative or proponent of the will shall forward notice by delivery or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the persons entitled to notice at their last known address.</p><p>E. Failure to give the notice required by this section shall not (i) affect the validity of the probate of a decedent&#39;s will or (ii) render any person required to give notice, who has acted in good faith, liable to any person entitled to receive notice. In determining the limitation period for any rights that may commence upon or accrue by reason of such probate or qualification in favor of any entitled person, the time that elapses from the date that notice should have been given to the date that notice is given shall not be counted, unless the person required to give notice could not determine the name and address of the entitled person after the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p><p>F. The personal representative or proponent of the will shall record within four months in the clerk&#39;s office where the will is recorded an affidavit stating (i) the names and addresses of the persons to whom he has mailed or delivered notice and when the notice was mailed or delivered to each or (ii) that no notice was required to be given to any person. The commissioner of accounts shall not approve any settlement filed by a personal representative until the affidavit described in this subsection has been recorded. If the personal representative of an estate or the proponent of a will is unable to determine the name and address of any person to whom notice is required after the exercise of reasonable diligence, a statement to that effect in the required affidavit shall be sufficient for purposes of this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any person having an interest in an estate may give the notice required by this section and record the affidavit described in this subsection. If this subsection has not been complied with within four months after qualification, the commissioner of accounts shall issue, through the sheriff or other proper officer, a summons to such fiduciary requiring him to comply, and if the fiduciary does not comply, the commissioner shall enforce the filing of the affidavit in the manner set forth in § <a href="/vacode/64.2-1215/">64.2-1215</a>.</p><p>G. The form of the notice to be given pursuant to this section, which shall contain appropriate instructions regarding its use, shall be provided to each clerk of the circuit court by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court and each clerk shall provide copies of such form to the proponents of a will or those qualifying on an estate.</p><p>1993, c. 4, § 64.1-122.2; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">78</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">265</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">716</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">614</a>; 2022, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">777</a>.</p>',12),r=[a];function s(l,c,h,p,d,f){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const v=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
