The Department of Rail and Public Transportation shall develop guidelines, subject to the approval of the Board, for the development of strategic plans for transit agencies that (i) serve an urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more and (ii) have a bus fleet consisting of at least 20 buses.</p><p>B. As a condition of receiving funds from the Commonwealth Mass Transit Fund, any transit agency that meets the criteria of subsection A shall develop, and update at least once every five years, a strategic plan using the guidelines approved by the Board.</p><p>C. The guidelines shall require the following:</p><ol><li><p>An assessment of state of good repair needs;</p></li><li><p>A review of the performance of fixed-route bus service, including schedules, route design, connectivity, and vehicle sizes;</p></li><li><p>An evaluation of opportunities to improve operating efficiency of the transit network, including reliability of trips and travel speed;</p></li><li><p>An examination and identification of opportunities to share services where multiple transit providers&#39; services overlap; and</p></li><li><p>An examination of opportunities to improve service in underserved areas.</p></li></ol><p>D. In addition to developing and updating a strategic plan pursuant to this section, in all planning districts with transit systems collectively serving population areas of not less than 1.5 million nor more than 2 million, such transit systems shall develop a regional transit planning process coordinated by the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization. Such planning process shall include the identification and prioritization of projects, the establishment of performance benchmarks that incorporate state and federal requirements, the development and implementation of a regional subsidy allocation model, and the distribution of funds solely designated for transit and rail and that are administered by a regional body authorized by this Code to enter into agreements for the operation and maintenance of transit and rail facilities.</p><p>2018, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">854</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">856</a>.</p>',7),o=[r];function s(l,p,d,c,h,f){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const m=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
