A member shall receive an annual retirement allowance, payable for life, as follows:</p><ol><li>Normal retirement. -- The allowance shall equal the amount of creditable service multiplied by (i) 1.70 percent of his average final compensation for retirements prior to July 1, 2007, and (ii) 1.85 percent of his average final compensation for retirements on or after July 1, 2007.</li></ol><p>For retirements between October 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998, any state police officer who is a member or beneficiary of a retirement system administered by the Board shall receive an additional retirement allowance equal to three percent of the service or disability retirement allowance payable under this section. Average final compensation attributable to service as Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, or member of the General Assembly shall not be included in computing this additional retirement allowance.</p><ol start="2"><li>Early retirement. -- The allowance shall be determined in the same manner as for normal retirement with creditable service and average final compensation being determined as of the date of actual retirement. If the member has less than 25 years of service at retirement, the amount of the retirement allowance shall be reduced on an actuarial equivalent basis for the period by which the actual retirement date precedes the earlier of (i) his normal retirement date or (ii) the first date on or after his fiftieth birthday on which he would have completed a total of 25 years of creditable service.</li></ol><p>B. In addition to the allowance payable under subsection A, a member shall receive annually from the date of his retirement until his retirement age, as such term is defined under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 416 et seq., as now or hereafter amended), an allowance equal to $9,264. Beginning July 1, 2001, and biennially thereafter, such allowance shall be reviewed and adjusted by the Board to an amount recommended by the actuary of the Virginia Retirement System based upon increases in social security benefits in the interim.</p><p>This subsection shall not apply to the following: (i) any member who qualifies for retirement under subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-205/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-205</a> and is credited with less than 20 years&#39; service rendered in a hazardous position or (ii) any member employed initially on or after July 1, 1974, who is credited with less than 20 years&#39; service rendered in a hazardous position. However, any service rendered as an employee, as such term is defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-212</a>, shall be deemed as service in a hazardous position for purposes of the additional retirement allowance herein.</p><p>C.
