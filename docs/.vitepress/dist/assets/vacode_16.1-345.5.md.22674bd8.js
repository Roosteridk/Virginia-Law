If the minor&#39;s parents and the minor, if necessary, do not join the motion, the court shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing in accordance with subsection A of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-345.4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">16.1-345.4</a>.</p><p>C.
