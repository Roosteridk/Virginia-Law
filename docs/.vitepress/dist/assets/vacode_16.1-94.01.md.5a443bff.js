When satisfaction of any judgment rendered in a court not of record is made, the judgment creditor shall by himself, or his agent or attorney, give written notice of such satisfaction, within 30 days of receipt, to the clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered. Such notice shall include the docket number, the names of the parties, and the date of the judgment. The clerk of the court shall then mark the judgment satisfied.

If the judgment creditor fails to comply with subsection A, the judgment debtor, his heirs or personal representatives, may, on motion, after 10 days&#39; notice thereof to the judgment creditor, or his assignee, his personal representative, or his agent or attorney, apply to the court in which the judgment was rendered to have the judgment marked satisfied. Upon proof that the judgment has been satisfied, the clerk shall mark the judgment satisfied. If the judgment creditor or his legal representatives cannot be reasonably located, the notice may be published and posted as an order of publication is required to be published and posted under §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-316/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-316</a> and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-317</a>.</p><p>C.
