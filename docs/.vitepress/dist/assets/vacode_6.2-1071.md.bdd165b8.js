The Commission may make such examinations of any office established and maintained in the Commonwealth pursuant to this article by an out-of-state trust institution as the Commission may deem necessary to determine whether the office is operating in compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth and to ensure the office is being operated in a safe and sound manner. The provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-901</a> that apply to examinations of banks shall apply to examinations of an office conducted under this section. The Commission shall also have authority to examine the principal office of an out-of-state trust institution, as necessary. When any such examination is conducted outside the Commonwealth, the out-of-state trust institution shall be liable for and shall pay to the Commission within 30 days of the presentation of an itemized statement, the actual travel and reasonable living expenses incurred on account of such examination, or shall pay for such examination at a reasonable per diem rate approved by the Commission.</p><p>B. The Commission may require periodic reports from any out-of-state trust institution that maintains an office in the Commonwealth to the extent such reporting requirements (i) apply equally to similarly situated trust institutions having Virginia as their home state and (ii) are not preempted by federal laws. Such reports shall be filed under oath with such frequency and in such scope and detail as may be appropriate for the purpose of assuring continuing compliance with the provisions of this article.</p><p>C. The Commission may enter into cooperative agreements with the appropriate state bank supervisors and federal bank regulatory agencies for the examination of any trust office in the Commonwealth of an out-of-state trust institution or any office of a state trust institution in any host state, and may accept such agency&#39;s report of examination and report of investigation in lieu of conducting its own examinations or investigations. The Commission may enter into joint actions with other state bank supervisors and federal banking agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over any office maintained in this state by an out-of-state trust institution or any office established and maintained by a state trust institution in any host state; however, the Commission may take such actions independently to carry out its responsibilities under this article and to assure compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth.</p><p>D. Out-of-state trust institutions may be assessed and, if assessed, shall pay supervisory and examination fees in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth and regulations of the Commission. Such fees may be shared with other state and federal bank supervisory agencies in accordance with agreements between them and the Commission.</p><p>1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">835</a>, § 6.1-32.40; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>.</p>',6),s=[o];function r(h,c,m,p,f,l){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,y as default};
