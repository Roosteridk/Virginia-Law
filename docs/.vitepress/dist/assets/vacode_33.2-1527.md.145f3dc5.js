The Fund shall be considered a part of the Transportation Trust Fund. Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purposes enumerated in subsection B. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller.</p><p>B. The Board shall use the Fund to facilitate the financing of priority transportation projects throughout the Commonwealth. The Board may use the Fund by (i) expending amounts therein on such projects directly; (ii) payment to any authority, locality, commission, or other entity for the purpose of paying the costs thereof; or (iii) using such amounts to support, secure, or leverage financing for such projects. No expenditures from or other use of amounts in the Fund shall be considered in allocating highway maintenance and construction funds under § <a href="/vacode/33.2-358/">33.2-358</a> or apportioning Transportation Trust Fund funds under § <a href="/vacode/58.1-638/">58.1-638</a> but shall be in addition thereto.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, beginning July 1, 2007, no bonds, obligations, or other evidences of debt (the bonds) that expressly require as a source for debt service payments or for the repayment of such bonds the revenues of the Fund shall be issued or entered into, unless at the time of the issuance the revenues then in the Fund or reasonably anticipated to be deposited into the Fund pursuant to the law then in effect are by themselves sufficient to make 100 percent of the contractually required debt service payments on all such bonds, including any interest related thereto and the retirement of such bonds.</p><p>2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1019</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1044</a>, § 33.1-23.03:8; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">896</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">766</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1230</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1275</a>.</p>',7),i=[o];function s(d,h,l,u,c,p){return t(),n("div",null,i)}const b=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
