Every water-retaining or silt-retaining dam or mine refuse pile shall be examined daily for visible structural weakness, volume overload, and other hazards by a qualified person designated by the licensed operator. When rising water and silt reaches 80 percent by volume of the safe design capacity of the dam or pile, such examination shall be made more often as required by the Director or his designated agent. Frequent examinations shall be made during periods of rainfall that could create flooding conditions.</p><p>B. When a potentially hazardous condition exists, the operator shall initiate procedures to:</p><ol><li><p>Remove all persons from the area that can reasonably be expected to be affected by such potentially hazardous condition;</p></li><li><p>Eliminate such potentially hazardous condition; and</p></li><li><p>Notify the Director.</p></li></ol><p>C.
