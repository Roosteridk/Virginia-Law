Any personal representative or trustee serving jointly with a bank or trust company that is exempted from giving surety on its bond under § <a href="/vacode/6.2-1003/">6.2-1003</a> shall, unless the court directs otherwise, also be exempt from giving surety.</p><p>C.

Each such certificate shall:</p><ol><li><p>Be titled &quot;Qualification Certificate for Small Asset Estate&quot;;</p></li><li><p>State in a prominent position on the front of such certificate that any person may pay or deliver to the fiduciary named in the certificate any asset belonging, owed, or distributable to the specified deceased person, incapacitated ward, or minor having a value, on the date of payment or delivery, of no more than $25,000. Assets held in a safe deposit box shall not be counted toward such $25,000 limit, and the lessor of a safe deposit box shall not be deemed to know of, and shall have no obligation to determine, the presence or value of any asset in a safe deposit box;</p></li><li><p>State that the certificate (i) may only be used once, (ii) is not effective if it does not have an impression seal of the court clerk and therefore photocopies of the certificate are not effective, and (iii) must be retained by the payor; and</p></li><li><p>Bear the impression seal of the court clerk.</p></li></ol><p>D. Upon being presented with a certificate of qualification issued pursuant to subsection C, any person may pay or deliver to the fiduciary named in such certificate any asset belonging, owed, or distributable to the specified deceased person, incapacitated ward, or minor having a value, on the date of payment, of no more than $25,000. The payor shall retain possession of such certificate. Assets held in a safe deposit box shall not be counted toward such $25,000 limit, and the lessor of a safe deposit box shall not be deemed to know of, and shall have no obligation to determine, the presence or value of any asset in a safe deposit box.
