The Board shall adopt emissions standards necessary to implement the emissions inspection program provided for in this article. Such standards shall include specifications and criteria that will enable the identification of vehicles whose emissions so far exceed those permissible under this article as to qualify them as &quot;gross violators,&quot; and enable the expedited identification of such vehicles through on-road testing pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/46.2-1178.1/">46.2-1178.1</a>.</p><p>B. The Board shall establish separate and distinct emissions standards applicable to on-road testing of motor vehicles pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/46.2-1178.1/">46.2-1178.1</a>. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this article, except for any motor vehicle registered as an antique motor vehicle or a military surplus motor vehicle, such criteria shall be applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for the 1968 model year or any more recent model year, with criteria for each model year being appropriate to that model year.</p><p>1980, c. 469, § 46.1-326.5; 1989, c. 727; 1993, cc. 995, 998; 1993, Sp.
