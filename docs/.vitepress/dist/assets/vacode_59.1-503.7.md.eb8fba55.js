In all other cases, a license contains an implied limitation that the licensee will not use the information or informational rights otherwise than as described in subsection (a). However, use inconsistent with this implied limitation is not a breach if it is permitted under applicable law in the absence of the implied limitation.</p><p>(c) A party is not entitled to any rights in new versions of, or improvements or modifications to, information made by the other party.
