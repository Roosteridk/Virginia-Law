Indian tribes that elect to make payments to reimburse the fund for benefits paid shall make such election in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/60.2-507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">60.2-507</a> pertaining to governmental entities that elect to make payments in lieu of taxes.

Failure of the Indian tribe or tribal unit to make any required payment, including any assessment of interest and penalty, within 90 days of its due date shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of taxes, as provided in subsection C, for the following tax year unless payment in full is received before tax rates for next tax year are computed.</p><p>H. Any Indian tribe that loses the option to make payments in lieu of taxes due to late payment or nonpayment, as described in subsection G, shall have such option reinstated if, after a period of one year, all taxes have been made timely, provided that no taxes, payments in lieu of taxes for benefits paid, penalties or interest remain outstanding.</p><p>I. Failure of the Indian tribe or any tribal unit thereof to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, after all collection activities deemed necessary by the Commission have been exhausted, shall cause services performed for such tribe to not be treated as &quot;employment&quot; as provided in subsection A.</p><p>J. The Commission may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under subsection I may have services performed for such tribe again included as &quot;employment&quot; as provided in subsection A if all taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, penalties, and interest have been paid.</p><p>K.
