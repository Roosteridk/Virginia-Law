Every managed care health insurance plan licensee shall request a certificate of quality assurance with reference to its managed care health insurance plans simultaneously with filing an initial application to the Bureau of Insurance for licensure. If already licensed by the Bureau of Insurance, every managed care health insurance plan licensee may file an application for quality assurance certification with the Department of Health by December 1, 1998, and shall file an application for quality assurance certification with the Department of Health by December 1, 1999, in order to obtain its certificate of quality assurance by July 1, 2000.</p><p>On or before July 1, 2000, the State Health Commissioner shall certify to the Bureau of Insurance that a managed care health insurance plan licensee has been issued a certificate of quality assurance by providing the Bureau of Insurance with a copy of each certificate at the time of issuance.</p><p>Application for a certificate of quality assurance shall be made on a form prescribed by the Board and shall be accompanied by a fee based upon a percentage, not to exceed one-tenth of one percent, of the proportion of direct gross premium income on business done in this Commonwealth attributable to the operation of managed care health insurance plans in the preceding biennium, sufficient to cover reasonable costs for the administration of the quality assurance program. Such fee shall not exceed $10,000 per licensee. Whenever the account of the program shows expenses for the past biennium to be more than 10 percent greater or lesser than the funds collected, the Board shall revise the fees levied by it for certification so that the fees are sufficient, but not excessive, to cover expenses; provided that such fees shall not exceed the limits set forth in this section. Until July 1, 2014, the Department may utilize such certification funds as are needed in fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to subsection B of § <a href="/vacode/32.1-16/">32.1-16</a>.</p><p>All applications, including those for renewal, shall require (i) a description of the geographic area to be served, with a map clearly delineating the boundaries of the service area or areas, (ii) a description of the complaint system required under § <a href="/vacode/32.1-137.6/">32.1-137.6</a>, (iii) a description of the procedures and programs established by the licensee to assure both availability and accessibility of adequate personnel and facilities and to assess the quality of health care services provided, and (iv) a list of the licensee&#39;s managed care health insurance plans.</p><p>B. Every managed care health insurance plan licensee certified under this article shall renew its certificate of quality assurance with the Commissioner biennially by July 1, subject to payment of the fee.</p><p>C. The Commissioner shall periodically examine or review each applicant for certificate of quality assurance or for renewal thereof.</p><p>No certificate of quality assurance may be issued or renewed unless a managed care health insurance plan licensee has filed a completed application and made payment of a fee pursuant to subsection A and the Commissioner is satisfied, based upon his examination, that, to the extent appropriate for the type of managed care health insurance plan under examination, the managed care health insurance plan licensee has in place and complies with: (i) a complaint system for reasonable and adequate procedures for the timely resolution of written complaints pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/32.1-137.6/">32.1-137.6</a>; (ii) a reasonable and adequate system for assessing the satisfaction of its covered persons; (iii) a system to provide for reasonable and adequate availability of and accessibility to health care services for its covered persons; (iv) reasonable and adequate policies and procedures to encourage the appropriate provision and use of preventive services for its covered persons; (v) reasonable and adequate standards and procedures for credentialing and recredentialing the providers with whom it contracts; (vi) reasonable and adequate procedures to inform its covered persons and providers of the managed care health insurance plan licensee&#39;s policies and procedures; (vii) reasonable and adequate systems to assess, measure, and improve the health status of covered persons, including outcome measures, (viii) reasonable and adequate policies and procedures to ensure confidentiality of medical records and patient information to permit effective and confidential patient care and quality review; (ix) reasonable, timely and adequate requirements and standards pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/32.1-137.9/">32.1-137.9</a>; and (x) such other requirements as the Board may establish by regulation consistent with this article.</p><p>Upon the issuance or reissuance of a certificate, the Commissioner shall provide a copy of such certificate to the Bureau of Insurance.</p><p>D. Upon determining to deny a certificate, the Commissioner shall notify such applicant in writing stating the reasons for the denial of a certificate. A copy of such notification of denial shall be provided to the Bureau of Insurance. Appeals from a notification of denial shall be brought by a certificate applicant pursuant to the process set forth in § <a href="/vacode/32.1-137.5/">32.1-137.5</a>.</p><p>E. The State Corporation Commission shall give notice to the Commissioner of its intention to issue an order based upon a finding of insolvency, hazardous financial condition, or impairment of net worth or surplus to policyholders or an order suspending or revoking the license of a managed care health insurance plan licensee; and the Commissioner shall notify the Bureau of Insurance when he has reasonable cause to believe that a recommendation for the suspension or revocation of a certificate of quality assurance or the denial or nonrenewal of such a certificate may be made pursuant to this article. Such notifications shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be subject to subpoena.</p><p>F. No certificate of quality assurance issued pursuant to this article may be transferred or assigned without approval of the Commissioner.</p><p>G. When determining the adequacy of a managed care health insurance plan proposed provider network or the ongoing adequacy of an in-force provider network, the Commissioner shall consider whether the managed care health insurance plan proposed provider network or in-force provider network includes a sufficient number of contracted providers of emergency services and surgical or ancillary services, as those terms are defined in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-3438/">38.2-3438</a>, at or for the managed care health insurance plan&#39;s contracted in-network hospitals to reasonably ensure that enrollees have in-network access to covered benefits delivered at that facility.</p><p>1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">891</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">670</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">679</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1080</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1081</a>.</p>',14),o=[r];function s(c,l,h,d,u,p){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const b=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
