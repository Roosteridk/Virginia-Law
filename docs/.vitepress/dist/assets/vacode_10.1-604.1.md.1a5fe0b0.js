The hazard potential classification for an impounding structure shall be determined by one of the following procedures:</p><ol><li><p>The owner of an impounding structure that does not currently hold a regular or conditional certificate from the Board, or the owner of an impounding structure that is already under certificate but the owner believes that a condition has changed downstream of the impounding structure that may reduce its hazard potential classification, may request that the Department conduct a simplified dam break inundation zone analysis to determine whether the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification. The owner shall pay 50 percent of the cost of the analysis. If the Department finds that the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification, the owner shall be eligible for general permit coverage in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-605.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-605.3</a>. If the Department finds that the impounding structure appears to be a high or significant hazard potential structure, the owner&#39;s engineer shall provide further analysis in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-606.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-606.2</a> and the criteria set out in the Impounding Structure Regulations (<a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title4/agency50/chapter20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">4VAC50-20</a>).

To support the proposed hazard classification, an analysis shall be conducted by the owner&#39;s engineer and shall comply with the criteria set out in the Impounding Structure Regulations (<a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title4/agency50/chapter20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">4VAC50-20</a>). If the engineer finds that the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification, the owner shall be eligible for general permit coverage in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-605.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-605.3</a>.</p></li></ol><p>An impounding structure&#39;s hazard potential classification&#39;s determination shall include an analysis of those hazards created by flood and nonflood dam failures. In conducting the hazard potential classification, the Department or the owner&#39;s engineer may utilize an incremental damage analysis. When considering the failure of the impounding structure under a flood condition, such engineers shall only consider those hazards that exceed those created by the flood event.</p><p>B. Any owner aggrieved by a decision of the Department regarding his impounding structure shall have the right to judicial review of the final decision pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4000</a> et seq.).</p><p>C.
