The beneficiary&#39;s bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.</p><p>(2) If the beneficiary&#39;s bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary&#39;s bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer.
