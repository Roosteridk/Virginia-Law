As part of every administrative support order directing a noncustodial parent to pay child or child and spousal support or by separate order at any time thereafter, provision shall be made for withholding from the income of the noncustodial parent the amount of the withholding order plus an amount to be applied toward liquidation of arrearages if the noncustodial parent fails to make payments in an amount equal to the support payable for one month. The total amount withheld shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34-29</a>.</p><p>B. Upon default of an administrative or judicial support order, the Department shall serve notice on the noncustodial parent&#39;s employer of the delinquency in accordance with the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-296/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-296</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-327/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-327</a> or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-329</a> or by certified mail or electronic means, including facsimile transmission, for delivery to the noncustodial parent. The notice shall inform the noncustodial parent (i) of the amount that will be withheld, (ii) that the withholding applies to any current or subsequent period of employment, (iii) of the right to contest but that the only basis for contesting the withholding is a mistake of fact, (iv) that a written request to contest the withholding must be made to the Department within 10 days of receipt of the notice, (v) of the actions that will be taken by the Department if a request to contest is noted, which shall include the opportunity to present his objections, which shall be limited to a mistake of fact, to the administrative hearing officer at a hearing held pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1942/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1942</a>, (vi) that a determination on the contest will be made no later than 45 days from the date of service of such notice, and (vii) that payment of overdue support upon receipt of the required notice shall not be a bar to the implementation of withholding.</p><p>C. The noncustodial parent&#39;s employer shall be issued by first-class or certified mail or by electronic means, including facsimile transmission, an administrative order for withholding of income that shall conform to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-79.3</a>. The rights and responsibilities of an employer with respect to such orders are set out in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-79.3</a>.</p><p>D. The Department shall have the authority in the issuance of an administrative order under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-79.3</a>, based on an existing court order, to convert the terms of payment to conform with the obligor&#39;s pay period interval. The Department shall utilize the conversion formula established by the Committee on District Courts.</p><p>E. Administrative orders for withholding from income shall be promptly terminated or modified by the Department when (i) the obligation to support has been satisfied and arrearages have been paid, (ii) the whereabouts of the child or child and custodial parent become unknown, or (iii) modification is appropriate because of a change in the amount of the obligation.</p><p>F. If a court of competent jurisdiction or the agency operating pursuant to an approved state plan under Sections 452 and 454 of the Social Security Act, as amended, in any state, territory of the United States or the District of Columbia has ordered a person to pay child or child and spousal support, upon notice and hearing as provided in this section, the Department shall issue an order, conforming to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-79.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-79.3</a>, to the noncustodial parent&#39;s employer in this Commonwealth to withhold from the income of the noncustodial parent pursuant to a foreign support order in the same manner as provided in this section for administrative orders originating in this Commonwealth. Similar orders of the Department may be enforced in a similar manner in such other state, territory or district.</p><p>1985, c. 488, § 63.1-250.3; 1986, c. 594; 1987, cc. 640, 658, 706; 1988, c. 906; 1990, c. 896; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">714</a>; 1997, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">648</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">663</a>; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">727</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">747</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">469</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">52</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">29</a>.</p>',8),n=[a];function s(l,h,d,c,p,f){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const g=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
