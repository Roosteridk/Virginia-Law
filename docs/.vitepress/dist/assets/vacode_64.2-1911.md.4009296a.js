A custodian shall take control of custodial property, register or record title to custodial property, if appropriate, and collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial property.</p><p>B. In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care set forth in the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-780/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-780</a> et seq.), except to the extent provided by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-1502/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-1502</a>. However, a custodian, in the custodian&#39;s discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor&#39;s estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.</p><p>C. A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on (i) the life of the minor only if the minor or the minor&#39;s estate is the sole beneficiary or (ii) the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor&#39;s estate, or the custodian in the capacity of custodian is the beneficiary during the period of custodianship.</p><p>D. A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and<br> distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly<br> as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an<br> undivided interest is so identified if the minor&#39;s interest is held as a<br> tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so<br> identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration<br> is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated,<br> in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: &quot;as a<br> custodian for......…(name of minor) under the Virginia Uniform<br> Transfers to Minors Act.&quot;</p><p>E. A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including the information necessary for the preparation of the minor&#39;s tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years.</p><p>1988, c. 516, § 31-48; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">517</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">614</a>.</p>',7),n=[a];function s(d,c,l,p,f,h){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const y=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
