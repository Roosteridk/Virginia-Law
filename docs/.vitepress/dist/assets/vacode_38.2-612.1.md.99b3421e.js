Except as otherwise provided in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-613/">38.2-613</a>, no insurance institution, agent, or insurance-support organization may, directly or through an affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party financial information about an individual collected or received in connection with an insurance transaction, unless:</p><ol><li><p>The individual has been given a clear and conspicuous notice in writing, or in electronic form if the individual agrees, stating that such financial information may be disclosed to such nonaffiliated third party;</p></li><li><p>The individual is given an opportunity, before such financial information is initially disclosed, to direct that such information not be disclosed, and in no case shall the individual be given less than 30 days from the date of notice to direct that such information not be disclosed;</p></li><li><p>The individual is given a reasonable means by which to exercise the right to direct that such information not be disclosed as well as an explanation that such right may be exercised at any time and that such right remains effective until revoked by the individual; and</p></li><li><p>The nonaffiliated third party agrees not to disclose such financial information to any other person unless such disclosure would otherwise be permitted by this article if made by the insurance institution, agent, or insurance-support organization.</p></li></ol><p>B. 1.
