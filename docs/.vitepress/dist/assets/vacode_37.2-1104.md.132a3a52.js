As used in this section, &quot;mental or physical condition&quot; includes intoxication.</p><p>B. The court or, if the court is unavailable, a magistrate serving the jurisdiction where the respondent is located may, with the advice of a licensed physician who has attempted to obtain informed consent of an adult person to treatment of a mental or physical condition, issue an order authorizing temporary detention of the adult person in a hospital emergency department or other appropriate facility for testing, observation, or treatment upon a finding that (i) probable cause exists to believe the person is incapable of making or communicating an informed decision regarding treatment of a physical or mental condition due to a mental or physical condition and (ii) the medical standard of care calls for observation, testing, or treatment within the next 24 hours to prevent injury, disability, death, or other harm to the person resulting from such mental or physical condition.</p><p>C. The duration of temporary detention pursuant to this section shall not exceed 24 hours, unless extended by the court as part of an order authorizing treatment under § <a href="/vacode/37.2-1101/">37.2-1101</a>. If, before completion of authorized testing, observation, or treatment, the physician determines that a person subject to an order under this subsection has become capable of making and communicating an informed decision, the physician shall rely on the person&#39;s decision on whether to consent to further testing, observation, or treatment. If, before issuance of an order under this subsection or during its period of effectiveness, the physician learns of an objection by a member of the person&#39;s immediate family to the testing, observation, or treatment, he shall so notify the court or magistrate, who shall consider the objection in determining whether to issue, modify, or terminate the order.</p><p>D. A court or, if the court is unavailable, a magistrate serving the jurisdiction may issue an order authorizing temporary detention for testing, observation, or treatment for a person who is also the subject of an emergency custody order issued pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/37.2-808/">37.2-808</a>, if such person meets the criteria set forth in subsection B. In any case in which an order for temporary detention for testing, observation, or treatment is issued for a person who is also the subject of an emergency custody order pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/37.2-808/">37.2-808</a>, the hospital emergency room or other appropriate facility in which the person is detained for testing, observation, or treatment shall notify the nearest community services board when such testing, observation, or treatment is complete, and the designee of the community services board shall, as soon as is practicable and prior to the expiration of the order for temporary detention issued pursuant to subsection B, conduct an evaluation of the person to determine if he meets the criteria for temporary detention pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/37.2-809/">37.2-809</a>.</p><p>1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">921</a>, § 37.1-134.21; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">814</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">946</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">985</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">790</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">66</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">104</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP1014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1014</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">716</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">551</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">691</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">659</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1233</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1267</a>.</p>',6),n=[a];function s(h,l,c,p,f,g){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const m=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
