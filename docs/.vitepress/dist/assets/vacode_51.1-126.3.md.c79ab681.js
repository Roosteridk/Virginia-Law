The University of Virginia Medical Center, hereafter referred to as the Medical Center, may establish one or more retirement plans covering in whole or in part its employees. The Medical Center is authorized to make contributions for the benefit of its employees who are covered by any plan established pursuant to this section. Any such alternative retirement plans for Medical Center employees shall not become effective until such time as the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia may determine. Except as provided herein, all employees of the Medical Center who are employed by the Medical Center on or after July 1, 2000, shall be participants in a Medical Center retirement plan established pursuant to this section, with a contribution by the Medical Center at a rate to be determined by the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. However, an employee hired by the Medical Center on or after July 1, 2003, who, as of the first day of such employment, is a current member of the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan established by this chapter shall elect to either: (i) continue to participate in such defined benefit retirement plan or (ii) choose the plan provided by the Medical Center with a contribution by the Medical Center at a rate to be determined by the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. Such election shall be exercised not later than 60 days from the time of the employee&#39;s entry into the performance of his duties for the Medical Center, and the election shall be irrevocable. During such 60-day period, to the time of such election, such employee shall participate in the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan established by this chapter. If such election is not made within the time period provided in this subsection, such employee shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the retirement plan established by the Medical Center.</p><p>B. With respect to any employee of the Medical Center who elects to continue to participate in the Virginia Retirement System defined benefit retirement plan, the Medical Center shall collect and pay all employee and employer contributions due to the Virginia Retirement System for retirement and group life insurance in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-124.1</a> et seq.) of this title for such employees. For Medical Center employees who elect or who are required pursuant to subsection A to become members of the retirement program established by the Medical Center, the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized plan shall transfer to the retirement plan established by the Medical Center assets equal to the actuarially determined present value of the accrued basic benefit as of the transfer date. For purposes hereof, the basic benefit shall be the benefit accrued under the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan, based on creditable service and average final compensation, as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-124.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-124.3</a> and determined as of the transfer date. The actuarial present value shall be determined on the same basis, using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used in determining the funding needs of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan, so that the transfer of assets to the retirement plan established by the Medical Center will have no effect on the funded status and financial stability of the Virginia Retirement System or other such authorized retirement plan.</p><p>C. No employee of the Medical Center who is an active member of any plan established under this section shall also be an active member of the retirement system established by this chapter or a beneficiary of such other plan other than as a contingent annuitant.</p><p>D. The University of Virginia Board of Visitors shall adopt guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of this section, including guidelines for the administration of any retirement plan established pursuant to this section. The Board shall have no duties and responsibilities with respect to such plan. The guidelines adopted by the Board of Visitors shall be filed with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System.</p><p>1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">933</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">995</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">723</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">369</a>.</p>',6),o=[n];function s(l,h,d,c,f,p){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const b=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
