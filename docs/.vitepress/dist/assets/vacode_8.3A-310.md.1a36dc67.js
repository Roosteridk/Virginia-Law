Discharge of the obligation does not affect any liability that the obligor may have as an endorser of the instrument.</p><p>(b) Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection (a), if a note or an uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:</p><p>(1) In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until it is paid or certified.
