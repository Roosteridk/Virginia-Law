Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3229/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-3229</a> et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1, the tax shall be levied on the assessed fair market value of the taxable real property. The rate of the special improvements tax, when combined with all other special taxes in this Code of any kind imposed on land within the district, shall not be more than 25 cents ($0.25) per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3203/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-3203</a>; however, if all the owners in any district so request in writing, this limitation on rate shall not apply. Such special improvements taxes shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the locality&#39;s taxes are collected and the proceeds shall be kept in a separate account. The effective date of the initial assessment shall be January 1 of the year following adoption of the resolution creating the district. All revenues received by each locality pursuant to such taxes shall be paid to or at the direction of the district commission for its use pursuant to this chapter.</p><p>2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">966</a>, § 33.1-453; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>.</p>',3),r=[i];function n(l,c,h,p,d,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const v=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
