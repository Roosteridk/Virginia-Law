For purposes of this section, "diligent effort" means a good faith search by HDA for mortgage guaranty insurance among admitted insurers resulting in declinations of coverage, by three unaffiliated insurers licensed and authorized in this Commonwealth to write the mortgage guaranty insurance coverage sought, at a premium equal to or less than the premium in force for the loans made or financed by HDA. HDA may provide financing and other funding to any such fund or corporation and may exercise all necessary or convenient rights and powers and perform all requisite duties and obligations relating thereto. Any such fund or corporation shall be subject to the direction and control of the commissioners of HDA and shall have such powers and duties as the commissioners of HDA shall prescribe. Any such fund or corporation may charge such premiums and may establish such reserves as HDA shall specify. HDA may specify that any such reserves shall be assets of such fund or corporation and shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of HDA. Any such fund or corporation, its directors, officers and employees, its assets and operations, and its policies of insurance and the premiums therefor shall not be subject to the provisions of Title 38.2 and rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
