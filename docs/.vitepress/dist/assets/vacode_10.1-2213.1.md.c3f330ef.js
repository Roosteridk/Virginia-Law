The Commonwealth shall provide matching grants for charitable contributions received on or after July 1, 2003, by the Foundation that are actually spent or expended by the Foundation in the material restoration of a historic presidential home. The amount of the matching grant to be paid by the Commonwealth shall equal $0.20 for each $1 of charitable contribution that is actually spent or expended by the Foundation in the material restoration of a historic presidential home.</p><p>C. In January of each calendar year the Foundation shall submit to the Director the total amount of charitable contributions it received that were actually spent or expended in the immediately preceding calendar year for the material restoration of a historic presidential home. As a condition of receiving a matching grant, the Foundation shall at the same time submit to the Director such other information requested by the Director that is reasonably necessary to verify such charitable contributions and the actual use of such contributions.</p><p>The Director shall, as soon as practicable after receiving such submission and verifying such charitable contributions and their actual expenditure for the material restoration of a historic presidential home, make a written certification to the Comptroller of the amount of the grant to be paid to the Foundation. The amount of the grant for each calendar year shall be paid to the Foundation in six equal annual installments on March 15 of each year beginning with the year of the Director&#39;s certification for the relevant calendar year.</p><p>D. In no case shall the total amount of grants paid under this section exceed 20 percent of the estimated eligible restoration expenses of the historic presidential home.
