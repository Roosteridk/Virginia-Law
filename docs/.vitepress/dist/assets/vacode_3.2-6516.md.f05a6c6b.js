It shall be a violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">59.1-196</a> et seq.) for a pet dealer to state, promise, or represent that a dog or cat is registered or capable of being registered with any animal pedigree registry organization if the pet dealer shall then fail to either effect such registration or provide the consumer with the documents necessary therefor within 120 days following the date of sale of such animal. In the event that a pet dealer fails to effect registration or to provide the necessary documents therefor within 120 days following the date of sale, the consumer shall be entitled to choose one of the following options:</p><ol><li><p>To return the animal and to receive a refund of the purchase price plus sales tax; or</p></li><li><p>To retain the animal and to receive a refund of an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the purchase price and sales tax.</p></li></ol><p>B.
