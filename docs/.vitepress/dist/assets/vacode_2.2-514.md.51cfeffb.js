Except as provided in this section or former § 23-38.33:1, the Attorney General may compromise and settle disputes, claims and controversies involving all interests of the Commonwealth including, but not limited to the Virginia Tort Claims Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-195.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-195.1</a> et seq.), and may discharge any such claims, but only after the proposed compromise, settlement or discharge, together with the reasons therefor, have been submitted in writing to the Governor and approved by him. Where any dispute, claim or controversy involves the interests of any department, institution, division, commission, board, authority or bureau of the Commonwealth, the Attorney General may compromise and settle or discharge the same provided the action is approved both by the Governor, as provided in this section, and by the head, or his designee, of the department, institution, division, board, authority or bureau that is interested. However, when any dispute, claim or controversy arises under the Virginia Tort Claims Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-195.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-195.1</a> et seq.) or otherwise involves the interests of any department, institution, division, commission, board, authority or bureau of the Commonwealth, and the settlement amount does not exceed $250,000, the Attorney General or an assistant Attorney General assigned to such department, institution, division, commission, board, authority or bureau, or such other designee of the Attorney General, may compromise and settle or discharge the same provided the action is approved by the head, or his designee, of the department, institution, division, board or bureau whose interests are in issue. When the dispute, claim or controversy involves a case in which the Commonwealth has a claim for sums due it as the result of hospital, medical or dental care furnished by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, the Attorney General or such assistant Attorney General may compromise and settle and discharge the same when the settlement amount does not exceed $250,000.</p><p>B. No settlement under subsection A shall be made subject to a confidentiality agreement that prohibits the Commonwealth, a state agency, officer or employee from disclosing the amount of such settlement except where such confidentiality agreement is imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise is required by law.</p><p>C. No settlement under subsection A shall be made subject to a confidentiality agreement if such settlement requires that a matter or issue shall be the subject of (i) regulatory action pursuant to Article 2 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4006</a> et seq.) of Chapter 40 of this title, or (ii) legislation proposed to be introduced in the General Assembly.</p><p>Code 1950, § 2-92; 1956, c. 387; 1966, c. 677, § 2.1-127; 1973, c. 219; 1979, c. 266; 1986, c. 180; 1989, c. 75; 1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">359</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">384</a>; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">118</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">844</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">729</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">217</a>.</p>',5),n=[a];function s(l,h,d,c,m,p){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
