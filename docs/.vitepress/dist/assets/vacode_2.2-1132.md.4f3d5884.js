The Division shall provide assistance in the administration of capital outlay construction projects set forth in the appropriation act, other than highway construction undertaken by the Department of Transportation and the acquisition or improvement of specialized cargo-handling equipment and related port infrastructure including, but not limited to, port construction, renovation, and demolition that is required in a timely manner to meet market demands to enhance commerce through the Virginia Port Authority, the review and approval of plans and specifications, and acceptance of completed projects.</p><p>B. The Division may establish standards, as needed, for construction by the Commonwealth and may, with the advice of the Attorney General, establish standard contract provisions and procedures for the procurement and administration of construction and for the procurement and administration of architectural and engineering services relating to construction, which shall be used by all departments, agencies and institutions of the Commonwealth. All departments, agencies and institutions of the Commonwealth shall ensure that the design and construction of state-owned buildings comply with the standards governing energy use and efficiency established by the Division. The standards may provide for incentive contracting that offers a contractor whose bid is accepted the opportunity to share in any cost savings realized by the Commonwealth when project costs are reduced by the contractor, without affecting project quality, during construction of the project. The fee, if any, charged by the project engineer or architect for determining the cost savings shall be paid as a separate cost and shall not be calculated as part of any cost savings.</p><p>C.

The Secretary of Administration shall establish guidelines to assist institutions in evaluating alternative project delivery methods prior to entering into a contract. For projects constructed pursuant to this subsection, the responsibility of the Division of Engineering and Buildings shall be as set forth in subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-98.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36-98.1</a>.</p><p>For purposes of this section, &quot;construction&quot; shall include new construction, reconstruction, renovation, restoration, major repair, demolition and all similar work upon buildings and ancillary facilities owned or to be acquired by the Commonwealth.
