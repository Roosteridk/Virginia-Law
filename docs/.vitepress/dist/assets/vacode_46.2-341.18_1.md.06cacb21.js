Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.18</a> that require the Commissioner act to disqualify only on the basis of conviction records for certain offenses committed while operating a commercial motor vehicle, the Commissioner shall also act to disqualify, as provided in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.18</a>, where he has received a record from another jurisdiction indicating that a Virginia licensee has been disqualified in that jurisdiction, solely as a result of his violation in that jurisdiction, of either of the two offenses listed in subdivisions 1 and 2, committed while operating a commercial motor vehicle, even though the disqualification was imposed as the result of an administrative or civil action and there was no court proceeding that could result in a conviction for such offense. The two offenses for which such action shall be taken are:</p><ol><li><p>Operation of a commercial motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of 0.04 percent or more, or</p></li><li><p>Refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcohol or drug content of blood or breath of the operator of a commercial motor vehicle under the implied consent laws of that jurisdiction.</p></li></ol><p>B. The Commissioner shall treat such a record of disqualification as though it were a conviction record from that jurisdiction under a law substantially similar to subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.24</a> or § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.26:4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.26:4</a>, respectively, for purposes of implementing the disqualification provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.18</a>. Such treatment as a conviction for purposes of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.18</a> shall be applicable only if the disqualification action is final and unappealable or has been appealed and the appeal dismissed or the action affirmed and no further appeals are possible under the laws of the jurisdiction wherein the offense was committed, and only if the disqualification period imposed by that jurisdiction is at least as long as the periods set out in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-341.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-341.18</a> for such an offense. If the Commissioner receives notice from a jurisdiction that a Virginia licensee has been subject to an administrative action or civil judgment resulting from a violation of subdivision A 1 or A 2, committed while operating a commercial motor vehicle, the Commissioner shall treat such notice as a conviction for the purposes of this article.</p><p>C. In no case shall the Commissioner act more than once to disqualify a Virginia licensee for any single violation committed in another jurisdiction, even though such violation may be reported by that jurisdiction as both an administrative or civil disqualification action and as a conviction from a court in that jurisdiction. Moreover, the Commissioner shall rescind a disqualification imposed pursuant to this section if the disqualification has been vacated or rescinded by the other jurisdiction as a result of the licensee&#39;s acquittal in the court proceedings, or the dismissal of those proceedings, in that jurisdiction.</p><p>2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">724</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">513</a>.</p>',6),n=[r];function s(c,l,h,f,d,u){return e(),o("div",null,n)}const v=i(a,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,v as default};
