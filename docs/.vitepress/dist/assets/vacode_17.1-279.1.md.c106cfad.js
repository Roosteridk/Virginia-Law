The imposition of such assessment shall be by ordinance of the governing body, which may provide for different sums in circuit courts and district courts. The assessment shall be collected by the clerk of the court in which the action is filed, remitted to the treasurer of the appropriate county, city, or town, and held by such treasurer subject to disbursements by the governing body to a local law-enforcement agency solely to fund software, hardware, and associated equipment costs for the implementation and maintenance of an electronic summons system. The imposition of a town assessment shall replace any county fee that would otherwise apply.</p><p>2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">325</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">546</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">643</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">342</a>.</p>',3),i=[n];function r(c,l,h,d,f,m){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const _=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,_ as default};
