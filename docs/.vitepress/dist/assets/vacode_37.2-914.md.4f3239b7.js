The court that placed the person on conditional release may modify conditions of release or remove conditions placed on release pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/37.2-912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">37.2-912</a>, upon petition of the Department, the supervising parole or probation officer, the Attorney General, or the person on conditional release or upon its own motion based on reports of the Department or the supervising parole or probation officer. However, the person on conditional release may petition only annually commencing six months after the conditional release order is issued. Upon petition, the court shall require the Department or, if the person is on parole or probation, the person&#39;s parole or probation officer to provide a report on the person&#39;s progress while on conditional release. The party petitioning for release shall transmit a copy of the petition to the Attorney General, the Commissioner, and the attorney for the Commonwealth for the locality that is the location of the respondent&#39;s residence.</p><p>B. As it deems appropriate based on the Department&#39;s or parole or probation officer&#39;s report and any other evidence provided to it, the court may issue a proposed order for modification or removal of conditions. The court shall provide notice of the order and their right to object to it within 21 days of its issuance to the person, the Department or parole or probation officer, the Attorney General, and the attorney for the Commonwealth for the locality that is the location of the respondent&#39;s residence. The proposed order shall become final if no objection is filed within 21 days of its issuance. If an objection is so filed, the court shall conduct a hearing at which the person on conditional release, the Attorney General, the Department or the parole or probation officer, and the attorney for the Commonwealth for the locality that is the location of the respondent&#39;s residence shall have an opportunity to present evidence challenging the proposed order. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall issue an order specifying conditions of release or removing existing conditions of release.</p><p>1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">946</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">985</a>, § 37.1-70.15; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">776</a>; 2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">989</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1018</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">716</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">740</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">662</a>.</p>',4),a=[n];function s(l,c,h,p,f,d){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const v=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
