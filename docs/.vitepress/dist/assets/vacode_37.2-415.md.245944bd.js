The maximum term of a provisional license shall be six months. A provisional license may be renewed for a period not to exceed six months if the provider is not able to demonstrate compliance with all licensing regulations but demonstrates progress towards compliance. However, in no case shall the total period of provisional licensure exceed 12 successive months. A provisional license shall be prominently displayed by the provider in a format determined by the Commissioner at the site of the affected service and shall indicate thereon the violations of licensing standards to be corrected and the expiration date of the license. Whenever the Commissioner issues a provisional license, the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4000</a> et seq.) shall apply.
