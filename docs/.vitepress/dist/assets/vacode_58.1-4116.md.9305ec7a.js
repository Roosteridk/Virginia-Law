The Director may suspend, revoke, refuse to renew, or assess a civil penalty against the holder of a license or permit in a sum not to exceed $100,000, after notice and a hearing. Such license or permit may, however, be temporarily suspended by the Director without prior notice, pending any prosecution, hearing, or investigation, whether by a third party or by the Director. A license may be suspended, revoked, or refused renewal by the Director for one or more of the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>Failure to comply with, or violation of, any provision of this chapter or any regulation or condition of the Department;</p></li><li><p>Failure to disclose facts during the application process that indicate that such license or permit should not have been issued;</p></li><li><p>Conviction of a felony under the laws of the Commonwealth or any other state or of the United States subsequent to issuance of a license or permit;</p></li><li><p>Failure to file any return or report, to keep any records, or to pay any fees or other charges required by this chapter;</p></li><li><p>Any act of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or conduct prejudicial to public confidence in the integrity of gaming operations;</p></li><li><p>A material change, since issuance of the license or permit, with respect to any matters required to be considered by the Director under this chapter; or</p></li><li><p>Other factors established by Board regulation.</p></li></ol><p>B. Such action by the Director shall be final unless appealed in accordance with § <a href="/vacode/58.1-4105/">58.1-4105</a>. Suspension or revocation of a license or permit for any violation shall not preclude criminal liability for such violation.</p><p>2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1197</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1248</a>.</p>',5),n=[a];function s(c,l,p,h,d,u){return o(),r("div",null,n)}const _=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,_ as default};
