A default order shall not be issued by the presiding officer unless the party against whom the default order is entered has been sent the notice that contains a notification that a default order may be issued against that party if that party fails without good cause to attend or appear at the hearing or informal fact-finding proceeding that is the subject of the notice.</p><p>C.
