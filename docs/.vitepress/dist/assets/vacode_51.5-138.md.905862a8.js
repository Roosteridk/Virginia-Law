If established, the agencies may establish a long-term care coordination committee composed of, but not limited to, representatives of each agency. The coordination committee may guide the coordination and administration of aging services and long-term care in the locality. The membership of the coordination committee may include, but is not limited to, representatives of the local department of public health, the local department of social services, the community services board or community mental health clinic, the area agency on aging, the local nursing home pre-admission screening team, and representatives of housing, transportation, and other appropriate local organizations that provide long-term care. A plan may be implemented that ensures the cost-effective utilization of all funds available for aging services and long-term care in the locality. Localities are encouraged to provide services and supports within each category of service in the continuum and to allow one person to deliver multiple aging services, when possible.</p><p>1982, c. 346, § 2.1-373.7; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0844" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">844</a>, § 2.2-708; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">391</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">419</a>; 2010, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">411</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">801</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">803</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">835</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">728</a>.</p>',3),n=[r];function l(c,s,g,d,h,f){return a(),i("div",null,n)}const v=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{p as __pageData,v as default};
