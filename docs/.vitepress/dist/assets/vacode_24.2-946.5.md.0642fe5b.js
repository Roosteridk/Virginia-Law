The State Board or the general registrar of any county or city may close the file of any candidate campaign committee or political committee required to file with it provided the committee has not filed a final report and the Board or registrar cannot locate either the candidate or his campaign treasurer, or in the case of any political committee, the Board or registrar cannot locate the treasurer or custodian of the books of the committee. A candidate campaign committee file shall not be closed if the candidate has filed a report with the Board or registrar for any campaign for any office within the prior five years. A political committee file shall not be closed if the committee has filed a report within the prior five years.</p><p>B. Once the committee&#39;s file has been closed, no more reports will be due and no additional penalties for failure to file will accrue. However, if the whereabouts of the candidate or his campaign treasurer, or in the case of any political committee, the treasurer or custodian of the books of the committee, later becomes known to the Board or registrar, it may reopen the file and send notice to the candidate, or in the case of any political committee, the treasurer or custodian of the books of the committee, requesting that he file the appropriate reports and pay any penalties that were levied before the file was closed by it.</p><p>1975, c. 515, § 24.1-262; 1984, c. 480, § 24.1-257.1; 1986, c. 558, § 24.1-257.2; 1988, c. 734; 1990, c. 976; 1991, c. 709; 1993, c. 641, § 24.2-929; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">752</a>; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">785</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">233</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">511</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">555</a>, §§ 24.2-920.1, 24.2-923.1; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">620</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">635</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">648</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">457</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">480</a>; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">371</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">676</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">745</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">787</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">892</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">644</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">645</a>.</p>',4),n=[o];function l(c,g,f,h,s,p){return r(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
