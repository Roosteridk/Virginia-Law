The residential property disclosure statement shall be delivered in accordance with § <a href="/vacode/55.1-709/">55.1-709</a>.</p><p>D. The Real Estate Board shall make available on its website a flood risk information form. Such form shall be substantially as follows:</p><p>Flood Risk Information Form</p><p>The purpose of this information form is to provide property owners and potential property owners with information regarding flood risk. This information form does not determine whether a property owner will be required to purchase a flood insurance policy. That determination is made by the lender providing a loan for the property at the lender&#39;s discretion.</p><p>Mortgage lenders are mandated under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 to require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who acquire loans from federally regulated, supervised, or insured financial institutions for the acquisition or improvement of land, facilities, or structures located within or to be located within a Special Flood Hazard Area. A Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) is a high-risk area defined as any land that would be inundated by a flood, also known as a base flood, having a one percent chance of occurring in a given year. The lender reviews the current National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps for the community in which the property is located to determine its location relative to the published SFHA and completes the Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (SFHDF), created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). If the lender determines that the structure is indeed located within a SFHA and the community is participating in the NFIP, the borrower is then notified that flood insurance will be required as a condition of receiving the loan. A similar review and notification are completed whenever a loan is sold on the secondary loan market or when the lender completes a routine review of its mortgage portfolio.</p><p>Properties that are not located in a SFHA can still flood. Flood damage is not generally covered by a standard home insurance policy. It is prudent to consider purchasing flood insurance even when flood insurance is not required by a lender. Properties not located in a SFHA may be eligible for a low-cost preferred risk flood insurance policy. Property owners and buyers are encouraged to consult with their insurance agent about flood insurance.</p><p>What is a flood? A flood is a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties, at least one of which is the policyholder&#39;s property, from (i) overflow of inland or tidal waters, (ii) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, (iii) mudflow, or (iv) collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood.</p><p>FEMA is required to update Flood Maps every five years. Flood zones for this property may change due to periodic map updates. To determine what flood zone or zones a property is located in a buyer can visit the website for FEMA&#39;s National Flood Insurance Program or the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation&#39;s Flood Risk Information System website.</p><p>1992, c. 717, § 55-519; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">379</a>; 1998, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">384</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">795</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">510</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">247</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">514</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">533</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">705</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">767</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">265</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">784</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">491</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">641</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">518</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">461</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">357</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">79</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">269</a>; 2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">161</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">323</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">436</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">505</a>; 2017, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">386</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">569</a>; 2018, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">60</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">86</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">390</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">504</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">23</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">26</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">186</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">200</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">313</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">520</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">655</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">656</a>; 2021, Sp.
