If any provision in the condominium instruments requires the written consent of a mortgagee in order to amend the condominium instruments, the unit owners&#39; association shall be deemed to have received the written consent of a mortgagee if the unit owners&#39; association sends the text of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee at the address supplied by such mortgagee in a written request to the unit owners&#39; association to receive notice of proposed amendments to the condominium instruments and receives no written objection to the adoption of the amendment from the mortgagee within 60 days of the date that the notice of amendment is sent by the unit owners&#39; association, unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise. If the mortgagee has not supplied an address to the unit owners&#39; association, the unit owners&#39; association shall be deemed to have received the written consent of a mortgagee if the unit owners&#39; association sends the text of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee at the address filed in the land records or with the local tax assessor&#39;s office and receives no written objection to the adoption of the amendment from the mortgagee within 60 days of the date that the notice of amendment is sent by the unit owners&#39; association, unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise.</p><p>B. Any amendment adopted without the required consent of a mortgagee shall be voidable only by an institutional lender that was entitled to notice and an opportunity to consent. An action to void an amendment shall be subject to the one-year statute of limitations set forth in subsection C of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1934/">55.1-1934</a> beginning on the date of recordation of the amendment.</p><p>C. Subsection A shall not apply to amendments that alter the priority of the lien of the mortgagee or that materially impair or affect the unit as collateral or the right of the mortgagee to foreclose on a unit as collateral.</p><p>D. Where the condominium instruments are silent on the need for mortgagee consent, no mortgagee consent shall be required if the amendment to the condominium instruments does not specifically affect mortgagee rights.</p><p>1993, c. 1, § 55-79.73:1; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">32</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">675</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">817</a>.</p>',6),r=[a];function s(m,d,c,h,l,f){return t(),n("div",null,r)}const p=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,p as default};
