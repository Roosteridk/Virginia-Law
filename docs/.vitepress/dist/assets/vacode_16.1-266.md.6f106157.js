Subsequent to the detention hearing, if any, and prior to the adjudicatory or transfer hearing by the court of any case involving a child who is alleged to be in need of services, in need of supervision or delinquent, such child and his parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis shall be informed by a judge, clerk or probation officer of the child&#39;s right to counsel and of the liability of the parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis for the costs of such legal services pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-267/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">16.1-267</a> and be given an opportunity to:</p><ol><li><p>Obtain and employ counsel of the child&#39;s own choice; or</p></li><li><p>Request that the court appoint counsel, provided that before counsel is appointed or the court continues any appointment previously made pursuant to subsection B, the court shall determine that the child is indigent within the contemplation of the law pursuant to guidelines set forth in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-159/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-159</a> by requiring the child&#39;s parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis to complete a statement of indigence substantially in the form provided by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-159/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-159</a> and a financial statement, and upon determination of indigence the court shall appoint an attorney from the list maintained by the Indigent Defense Commission pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-163.01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-163.01</a> to represent the child; or</p></li><li><p>Waive the right to representation by an attorney, if the court finds the child and the parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis of the child consent, in writing, and such waiver is consistent with the interests of the child. Such written waiver shall be in accordance with law and shall be filed with the court records of the case. A child who is alleged to have committed an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult, may waive such right only after he consults with an attorney and the court determines that his waiver is free and voluntary. The waiver shall be in writing, signed by both the child and the child&#39;s attorney and shall be filed with the court records of the case.</p></li></ol><p>D.

In all other cases which in the discretion of the court require counsel or a guardian ad litem, or both, to represent the child or children or the parent or guardian, discreet and competent attorneys-at-law may be appointed by the court. However, in cases where the custody of a child or children is the subject of controversy or requires determination and each of the parents or other persons claiming a right to custody is represented by counsel, the court shall not appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the child or children unless the court finds, at any stage in the proceedings in a specific case, that the interests of the child or children are not otherwise adequately represented.</p><p>G.

Upon request therefor by the guardian ad litem or counsel for the child made at least 72 hours in advance, a mental health care provider shall make himself available to conduct a review and interpretation of the child&#39;s treatment records which are specifically related to the investigation. Such a request may be made in lieu of or in addition to inspection and copying of the records.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 16.1-173, 63.1-248.12; 1956, c. 555; 1966, c. 709; 1968, c. 581; 1970, c. 87; 1973, c. 440; 1974, c. 513; 1975, cc. 341, 465, 559; 1977, c. 559; 1980, c. 572; 1982, c. 451; 1984, c. 709; 1985, c. 260; 1987, c. 632; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36</a>; 1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">790</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">687</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">98</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">66</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">437</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">884</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">921</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP1014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1014</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">427</a>.</p>',13),o=[n];function l(h,s,c,d,p,g){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const v=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
