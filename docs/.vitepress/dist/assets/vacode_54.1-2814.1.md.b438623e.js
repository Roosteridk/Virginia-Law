The Board shall prescribe the procedures for registration under this section.

The Board may suspend or revoke any crematory registration or deny any application for such registration, or refuse to issue or renew any such registration, if the Board finds that the applicant or registrant has violated any provision of this chapter, the Board&#39;s regulations, or if the Board finds the crematory has operated or is operating in a manner that endangers the health, safety or welfare of the public.</p><p>2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">773</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">505</a>.</p>',5),s=[i];function n(c,h,l,d,p,g){return r(),a("div",null,s)}const _=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
