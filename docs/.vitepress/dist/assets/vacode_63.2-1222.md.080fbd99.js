For the purposes of this section, a birth parent who is less than 18 years of age shall be deemed fully competent and shall have legal capacity to execute a valid entrustment agreement, including an agreement that provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities, and perform all acts related to adoption and shall be as fully bound thereby as if such birth parent had attained the age of 18 years.</p><p>B. An entrustment agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the birth father of a child born out of wedlock if the identity of the birth father is not reasonably ascertainable or such birth father did not register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1249</a> et seq.) or the birth father named by the birth mother denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. An affidavit signed by the birth mother stating that the identity of the birth father is unknown may be filed with the court alleging that the identity of the birth father is not known or reasonably ascertainable. A birth father shall be given notice of the entrustment if he is an acknowledged father pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-49.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-49.1</a>, an adjudicated father pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-49.8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-49.8</a>, a presumed father pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1202</a>, or a putative father who has registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1249</a> et seq.). If the putative father&#39;s identity is reasonably ascertainable, he shall be given notice pursuant to the requirements of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1250</a>.</p><p>C. When a birth father is required to be given notice, he may be given notice of the entrustment by registered or certified mail to his last known address. If he fails to object to the entrustment within 15 days of the mailing of such notice, his entrustment shall not be required. An objection to an entrustment agreement shall be in writing, signed by the objecting party or counsel of record for the objecting party and filed with the agency that mailed the notice of entrustment within the time period specified in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1223/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1223</a>.</p><p>D. The execution of an entrustment agreement shall be required of a presumed father except under the following circumstances: (i) if he denies paternity under oath and in writing in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1202</a>; (ii) if the presumption is rebutted by sufficient evidence, satisfactory to the circuit court, which would establish by a preponderance of the evidence the paternity of another man or the impossibility or improbability of cohabitation of the birth mother and her husband for a period of at least 300 days preceding the birth of the child; (iii) if another man admits, in writing and under oath, that he is the biological father; or (iv) if an adoptive placement has been determined to be in the best interests of the child pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1205/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1205</a>.</p><p>E. When none of the provisions of subsections C and D apply, notice of the entrustment shall be given to the presumed father pursuant to the requirements of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-277.01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">16.1-277.01</a>.</p><p>F. An entrustment agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the birth father of a child when the birth father has been convicted of a violation of subsection A of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-61/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-61</a>, § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-63/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-63</a>, subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-366/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-366</a>, or an equivalent offense of another state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, and the child was conceived as a result of such violation.</p><p>G. A birth father may execute an entrustment agreement for the termination of all of his parental rights prior to the birth of the child. Such entrustment shall be subject to the revocation provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1223/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1223</a>.</p><p>H. No entrustment shall be required of a birth father if he denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. Such denial of paternity may be withdrawn no more than 10 days after it is executed. Once the child is 10 days old, any executed denial of paternity is final and constitutes a waiver of all rights with respect to the adoption of the child and cannot be withdrawn.</p><p>I. A copy of the entrustment agreement shall be furnished to all parties signing such agreement.</p><p>J. When any agency outside the Commonwealth, or its agent, that is licensed or otherwise duly authorized to place children for adoption by virtue of the laws under which it operates executes an entrustment agreement in the Commonwealth with a birth parent for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, the requirements of §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1221</a> through <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1224/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1224</a> shall apply. The birth parent may expressly waive, under oath and in writing, the execution of the entrustment under the requirements of §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1221</a> through <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1224/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1224</a> in favor of the execution of an entrustment or relinquishment under the laws of another state if the birth parent is represented by independent legal counsel. Such written waiver shall expressly state that the birth parent has received independent legal counsel advising of the laws of Virginia and of the other state and that Virginia law is expressly being waived. The waiver also shall include the name, address, and telephone number of such legal counsel. Any entrustment agreement that fails to comply with such requirements shall be void.</p><p>1989, c. 647, § 63.1-220.2; 1990, c. 202; 1991, c. 364; 1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">772</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">826</a>; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP1028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1028</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">830</a>, § 63.1-219.29; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">747</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">815</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">890</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">825</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">848</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">606</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">623</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">424</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">200</a>.</p>',12),o=[n];function h(l,s,f,c,g,d){return t(),r("div",null,o)}const b=e(a,[["render",h]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
