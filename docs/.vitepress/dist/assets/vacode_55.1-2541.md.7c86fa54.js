For the purposes of this section, &quot;jeopardized by delay&quot; means a finding that the applicant intends to undertake a wrongful act with the intent to prejudice, or to render ineffectual, future proceedings to enforce this chapter.</p><p>B. The administrator may adopt necessary regulations to carry out the provisions of this chapter.</p><p>C. If the administrator ascertains that any person has failed to pay or deliver abandoned property in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, he shall issue a written notice to such person demanding remittance of the property and payment of any penalties and interest prescribed by law. Every such notice shall be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the holder&#39;s right to secure an administrative or judicial review. The abandoned property, together with penalties and interest, if any, shall be remitted to the administrator within 90 days from the date notice is received by the holder unless the holder requests (i) an administrative review in accordance with regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection D or (ii) a judicial review in accordance with § <a href="/vacode/55.1-2534/">55.1-2534</a>.</p><p>D.

The State Treasurer shall refrain from collecting a contested charge until he has made a final determination under this section unless he determines that collection may be jeopardized by delay.</p><p>G. Except as otherwise provided in regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection D, the State Treasurer shall issue a written determination to the applicant within 90 days of receipt of an application for correction, unless the applicant is notified that a longer period will be required.
