It is the purpose of this compact to:</p><ol><li><p>Establish and maintain close cooperation and understanding among executive, legislative, professional, educational and lay leadership on a nationwide basis at the state and local levels.</p></li><li><p>Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.</p></li><li><p>Provide a clearinghouse of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.</p></li><li><p>Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods and facilities.</p></li></ol><p>B. It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.</p><p>C. The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions because individuals are highly mobile throughout the nation and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.</p><p>Article II.</p><p>As used in this compact, &quot;state&quot; means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Article III.</p><p>A. The Education Commission of the States, hereinafter called &quot;the Commission,&quot; is hereby established. The Commission shall consist of seven members representing each party state. One of such members shall be the governor; two shall be members of the state legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine; and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the Commission, six members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the Commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the Commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations, be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education and lay and professional, public and nonpublic educational leadership. Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution designated by the governor having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the Commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed ten nonvoting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.</p><p>B.

In its bylaws and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the Commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III (J).</p><p>C.

Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission and, together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the Commission may deem appropriate, shall be bonded in such amount as the Commission shall determine. The executive director shall serve as secretary of the Commission.</p><p>E. Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director, subject to the approval of the steering committee, shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the Commission and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The Commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the Commission.</p><p>F.

One fourth of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of governors, one fourth shall consist of legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the Commission. A federal representative on the Commission may serve without vote on the steering committee. The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two years except that members elected to the first steering committee of the Commission shall be elected as follows: Sixteen for one year and sixteen for two years. The chairman, vice-chairman, and treasurer of the Commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices.

No person shall serve more than two terms as a member of the steering committee; provided that service for a partial term of one year or less shall not be counted toward the two term limitation.</p><p>B.

In making such apportionment, the Commission shall devise and employ a formula which takes equitable account of the populations and per capita income levels of the party states.</p><p>C. The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any party states. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to paragraph G of Article III of this compact, provided that the Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Commission makes use of funds available to it pursuant to paragraph G of Article III of this compact, the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p><p>D.

No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p><p>Article IX.</p><p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or if the application thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
