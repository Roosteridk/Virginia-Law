In furtherance of the purpose of providing affordable shelter for all, the governing body of any locality, other than localities to which § <a href="/vacode/15.2-2304/">15.2-2304</a> applies, may by amendment to the zoning ordinances of such locality provide for an affordable housing dwelling unit program. Such program shall address housing needs, promote a full range of housing choices, and encourage the construction and continued existence of housing affordable to low-and-moderate-income citizens by providing for increases in density to the applicant in exchange for the applicant voluntarily electing to provide such affordable housing. Any local ordinance providing optional increases in density for provision of low-and-moderate-income housing adopted before December 31, 1988, shall continue in full force and effect. Any local ordinance may authorize the governing body to (i) establish qualifying jurisdiction-wide affordable dwelling unit sales prices based on local market conditions, (ii) establish jurisdiction-wide affordable housing dwelling unit qualifying income guidelines, and (iii) offer incentives other than density increases, such as reductions or waivers of permit, development, and infrastructure fees, as the governing body deems appropriate to encourage the provision of affordable housing. Counties to which § <a href="/vacode/15.2-2304/">15.2-2304</a> applies shall be governed by the provisions of § <a href="/vacode/15.2-2304/">15.2-2304</a> for purposes of the adoption of an affordable housing dwelling unit ordinance.</p><p>B.

The local housing fund may be a dedicated fund within the other funds of the locality, but any funds received pursuant to this section shall be used for achieving the affordable housing goals of the locality. A locality shall not condition the submission, review, or approval of any application for a housing development upon a contribution by the applicant to the locality&#39;s housing trust fund.</p></li><li><p>For reasonable regulations requiring the affordable dwelling units to be built and offered for sale or rental concurrently with the construction and certificate of occupancy of a reasonable proportion of the market rate units.</p></li><li><p>For administration and regulation by a local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee of the sale and rental of affordable units.</p></li><li><p>For a local housing authority or local governing body or its designee to have an exclusive right to purchase up to one-third of the for-sale affordable housing dwelling units within a development within 90 days of a dwelling unit being completed and ready for purchase, provided that the remaining two-thirds of such units be offered for sale exclusively for a 90-day period to persons who meet the income criteria established by the local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee.</p></li><li><p>For a local housing authority or a local governing body or its designee to have an exclusive right to lease up to a specified percentage of the rental affordable dwelling units within a development within a controlled period determined by the housing authority or the local governing body or its designee, provided that the remaining for-rental affordable dwelling units within a development be offered to persons who meet the income criteria established by the local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee.</p></li><li><p>For the establishment of jurisdiction-wide affordable housing dwelling unit sales prices by the local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee, initially and adjusted semiannually, based on a determination of all ordinary, necessary, and reasonable costs required to construct the affordable dwelling unit prototype dwellings by private industry after considering written comment by the public, the local housing authority, or an advisory body to the local governing body, and other information such as the area&#39;s current general market and economic conditions, provided that sales prices do not include the cost of land, on-site sales commissions, and marketing expenses, but may include, among other costs, builder-paid permanent mortgage placement costs and buy-down fees and closing costs except prepaid expenses required at settlement.</p></li><li><p>For the establishment of jurisdiction-wide affordable dwelling unit rental prices by a local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee, initially and adjusted semiannually, based on a determination of all ordinary, necessary, and reasonable costs required to construct and market the required number of affordable dwelling rental units by private industry in the area, after considering written comment by the public, the local housing authority, or an advisory body to the local governing body, and other information such as the area&#39;s current general market and economic conditions.</p></li><li><p>For a requirement that the prices for the sales and rentals of affordable dwelling units subsequent to the initial sale or rental transaction be controlled by the local housing authority or the local governing body or its designee for a period of not less than 15 years nor more than 50 years after the initial sale or rental transaction for each affordable dwelling unit, provided that the ordinance further provides for reasonable rules and regulations to implement a price control provision.</p></li></ol><p>C.
