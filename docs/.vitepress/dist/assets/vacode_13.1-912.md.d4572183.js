When a corporation has distributed all of its assets and voluntary dissolution proceedings have not been revoked, it shall file articles of termination of corporate existence with the Commission. The articles shall set forth:</p><ol><li><p>The name of the corporation;</p></li><li><p>That all the assets of the corporation have been distributed; and</p></li><li><p>That the dissolution of the corporation has not been revoked.</p></li></ol><p>B. If the Commission finds that the articles of termination of corporate existence comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall by order issue a certificate of termination of corporate existence. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the existence of the corporation shall cease, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings and appropriate corporate action by members, directors and officers as provided in this Act.</p><p>C.
