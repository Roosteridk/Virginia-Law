The court may, in lieu of restoring the person&#39;s privilege to drive, authorize the issuance of a restricted license for a period not to exceed five years in accordance with the provisions of § <a href="/vacode/18.2-270.1/">18.2-270.1</a> and subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/18.2-271.1/">18.2-271.1</a>.
