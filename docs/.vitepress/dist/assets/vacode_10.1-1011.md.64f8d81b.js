To ensure that the owner of the fee is not taxed on the value of the interest of the holder of the easement, the fair market value of such land (i) shall be based only on uses of the land that are permitted under the terms of the easement and (ii) shall not include any value attributable to the uses or potential uses of the land that have been terminated by the easement.</p><p>C.

If an easement is in existence at the time the locality enacts land use assessment, the easement shall qualify for such assessment. Once the land with the easement qualifies for land use assessment, it shall continue to qualify so long as the locality has land use assessment.</p><p>1988, cc. 720, 891; 1993, c. 390; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">487</a>.</p>',5),o=[r];function i(h,l,c,d,f,p){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const v=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
