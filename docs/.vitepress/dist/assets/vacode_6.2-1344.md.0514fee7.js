A credit union organized under this chapter may merge, with the approval of the Commission, with one or more other credit unions, state or federal. In any case in which the surviving credit union will be a Virginia state-chartered credit union, a merger application, accompanied by an application fee of $300, shall be filed with the Commission. The Commission shall approve the application if the Commission finds that:</p><ol><li><p>The field of membership of the credit union which is proposed to result from the merger satisfies the requirements of subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1327/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-1327</a>, unless the merger application is exempt from this condition pursuant to subsection B;</p></li><li><p>The plan of merger will promote the best interests of the members of the credit unions; and</p></li><li><p>The members of the merging credit unions have approved the plan of merger in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

For the purposes of this section, a member entitled to vote may vote in person or, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws otherwise provide, by proxy. A member may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him by signing an appointment form.
