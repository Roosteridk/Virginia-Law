The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall provide comprehensive health care benefits to program participants, including well-child and preventive services, to the extent required to comply with federal requirements of Title XXI of the Social Security Act.

The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall ensure that coverage under this program does not substitute for private health insurance coverage.</p><p>G. The health care benefits provided under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall be through existing Department of Medical Assistance Services&#39; contracts with health maintenance organizations and other providers, or through new contracts with health maintenance organizations, health insurance plans, other similarly licensed entities, or other entities as deemed appropriate by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, or through employer-sponsored health insurance. All eligible individuals, insofar as feasible, shall be enrolled in health maintenance organizations.</p><p>H. The Department of Medical Assistance Services may establish a centralized processing site for the administration of the program to include responding to inquiries, distributing applications and program information, and receiving and processing applications. The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall include a provision allowing a child&#39;s application to be filed by a parent, legal guardian, authorized representative or any other adult caretaker relative with whom the child lives. The Department of Medical Assistance Services may contract with third-party administrators to provide any additional administrative services. Duties of the third-party administrators may include, but shall not be limited to, enrollment, outreach, eligibility determination, data collection, premium payment and collection, financial oversight and reporting, and such other services necessary for the administration of the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan. Any centralized processing site shall determine a child&#39;s eligibility for either Title XIX or Title XXI and shall enroll eligible children in Title XIX or Title XXI. A single application form shall be used to determine eligibility for Title XIX or Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, and outreach, enrollment, re-enrollment and services delivery shall be coordinated with the FAMIS Plus program pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/32.1-325/">32.1-325</a>. In the event that an application is denied, the applicant shall be notified of any services available in his locality that can be accessed by contacting the local department of social services.</p><p>I. The Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, shall include a provision that, in addition to any centralized processing site, local social services agencies shall provide and accept applications for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and shall assist families in the completion of applications. Contracting health plans, providers, and others may also provide applications for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and may assist families in completion of the applications.</p><p>J. The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall develop and submit to the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services an amended Title XXI plan for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and may revise such plan as may be necessary. Such plan and any subsequent revisions shall comply with the requirements of federal law, this chapter, and any conditions set forth in the appropriation act. In addition, the plan shall provide for coordinated implementation of publicity, enrollment, and service delivery with existing local programs throughout the Commonwealth that provide health care services, educational services, and case management services to children. In developing and revising the plan, the Department of Medical Assistance Services shall advise and consult with the Joint Commission on Health Care.</p><p>K. Funding for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall be provided through state and federal appropriations and shall include appropriations of any funds that may be generated through the Virginia Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan Trust Fund.</p><p>L. The Board of Medical Assistance Services, or the Director, as the case may be, shall adopt, promulgate, and enforce such regulations pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href="/vacode/2.2-4000/">2.2-4000</a> et seq.) as may be necessary for the implementation and administration of the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan.</p><p>M. Children enrolled in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act prior to implementation of these amendments shall continue their eligibility under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and shall be given reasonable notice of any changes in their benefit packages. Continuing eligibility in the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan for children enrolled in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act prior to implementation of these amendments shall be determined in accordance with their regularly scheduled review dates or pursuant to changes in income status. Families may select among the options available pursuant to subsections D and F of this section.</p><p>N. The provisions of Chapter 9 (§ <a href="/vacode/32.1-310/">32.1-310</a> et seq.) of this title relating to the regulation of medical assistance shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan.</p><p>O. In addition, in any case in which any provision set forth in Title 38.2 excludes, exempts or does not apply to the Virginia plan for medical assistance services established pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (Medicaid), such exclusion, exemption or carve out of application to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) shall be deemed to subsume and thus to include the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) Plan, established pursuant to Title XXI of the Social Security Act, upon approval of FAMIS by the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services as Virginia&#39;s State Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program.</p><p>1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">679</a>; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP1034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1034</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">824</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">848</a>; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">238</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">735</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">756</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">640</a>; 2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">66</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">71</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">521</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">584</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">428</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">407</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">646</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">689</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">183</a>; 2021, Sp.
