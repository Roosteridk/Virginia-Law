Notwithstanding the provisions of § <a href="/vacode/46.2-410/">46.2-410</a>, when the Commissioner orders a revocation or suspension of a person&#39;s driver&#39;s license under the provisions of this chapter, the person so aggrieved may, in cases of manifest injustice, within 60 days of receipt of notice of the suspension or revocation, petition the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein he resides for a hearing to review the Commissioner&#39;s order. Manifest injustice is defined as those instances where the Commissioner&#39;s order was the result of an error or was issued without authority or jurisdiction. The person shall provide notice of his petition to the attorney for the Commonwealth of that jurisdiction.</p><p>B.
