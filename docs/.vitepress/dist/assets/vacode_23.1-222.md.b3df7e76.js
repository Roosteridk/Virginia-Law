The Council may, by regulation, authorize its director to take immediate action on its behalf in any instance in which a postsecondary school holding certification to operate in the Commonwealth is the subject of an adverse action by the U.S. Department of Education or the postsecondary school&#39;s accrediting agency. When such adverse action threatens a disruption of the operation of the postsecondary school and exposes students to a loss of course or degree credit or financial loss, the director may:</p><ol><li><p>Suspend new enrollment in specified programs or degree levels or all programs and degree levels that have been approved by the Council;</p></li><li><p>Require the postsecondary school to provide a guaranty instrument in the amount necessary to cover the refund of unearned tuition to all students enrolled at the time of the action; or</p></li><li><p>Take such other actions as may be necessary to protect the rights of currently enrolled or future students.</p></li></ol><p>B.
