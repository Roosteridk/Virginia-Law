A court of this Commonwealth that has jurisdiction under this act to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court&#39;s own motion, or request of another court.</p><p>B. Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to present evidence and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</p><ol><li><p>Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</p></li><li><p>The length of time the child has resided outside this Commonwealth;</p></li><li><p>The distance between the court in this Commonwealth and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</p></li><li><p>The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</p></li><li><p>Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</p></li><li><p>The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</p></li><li><p>The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and</p></li><li><p>The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</p></li></ol><p>C. If a court of this Commonwealth determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</p><p>D. A court of this Commonwealth may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this act if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.</p><p>1979, c. 229, § 20-130; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">305</a>.</p>',7),r=[a];function s(c,h,d,l,p,u){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const _=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
