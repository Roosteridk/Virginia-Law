Before granting a permit which approves site suitability for a new municipal solid waste landfill, the Director shall determine, in writing, that the site on which the landfill is to be constructed is suitable for the construction and operation of such a landfill. In making his determination, the Director shall consider and address, in addition to such others as he deems appropriate, the following factors:</p><ol><li><p>Based on a written, site-specific report prepared by the Virginia Department of Transportation, the adequacy of transportation facilities that will be available to serve the landfill, including the impact of the landfill on local traffic volume, road congestion, and highway safety;</p></li><li><p>The potential impact of the proposed landfill on parks and recreational areas, public water supplies, marine resources, wetlands, historic sites, fish and wildlife, water quality, and tourism; and</p></li><li><p>The geologic suitability of the proposed site, including proximity to areas of seismic activity and karst topography.</p></li></ol><p>The applicant shall provide such information on these factors as the Director may request.</p><p>B. In addition to such other types of locations as may be determined by the Board, no new municipal solid waste landfill shall be constructed:</p><ol><li><p>In a 100-year flood plain;</p></li><li><p>In any tidal wetland or nontidal wetland contiguous to any surface water body, except in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1408.5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-1408.5</a>;</p></li><li><p>Within three miles upgradient of any existing surface or groundwater public water supply intake or reservoir. However, a new municipal solid waste landfill may be constructed within a closer distance but no closer than one mile from any existing surface or groundwater public water supply intake or reservoir if: (i) the proposed landfill would meet all of the other requirements of this chapter and subtitle D of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, including alternative liner systems approved in accordance with that Act; (ii) the permit requires that groundwater protection standards be established and approved by the Director prior to the receipt of waste; (iii) the permit requires installation of at least two synthetic liners under the waste disposal areas and requires leachate collection systems to be installed above and below the uppermost liner; (iv) the permit requires all groundwater monitoring wells located within the facility&#39;s boundary and between the landfill and any water supply intake to be sampled quarterly and the results reported to the Department within 15 days of the owner or operator receiving the laboratory analysis; and (v) the proposed landfill meets any other conditions deemed necessary by the Director, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health, to protect against groundwater and surface water contamination. In the Counties of Mecklenburg and Halifax, a new municipal solid waste landfill may be exempt from the provisions of this subdivision and may be constructed within a shorter distance from an existing surface or groundwater public water supply intake or reservoir if the Director determines that such distance would not be detrimental to human health and the environment;</p></li><li><p>In any area vulnerable to flooding resulting from dam failures;</p></li><li><p>Over a sinkhole or less than 100 feet above a solution cavern associated with karst topography;</p></li><li><p>In any park or recreational area, wildlife management area or area designated by any federal or state agency as the critical habitat of any endangered species; or</p></li><li><p>Over an active fault.</p></li></ol><p>C. There shall be no additional exemptions granted from this section unless (i) the proponent has submitted to the Department an assessment of the potential impact to public water supplies, the need for the exemption, and the alternatives considered and (ii) the Department has made the information available for public review for at least 60 days prior to the first day of the next Regular Session of the General Assembly.</p><p>1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">584</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">613</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">947</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">767</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">834</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">920</a>.</p>',8),o=[n];function l(s,d,p,c,h,f){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const m=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
