If the Commission finds that (i) the minimum capital and surplus of a domestic stock insurer is impaired or (ii) the minimum surplus of a domestic mutual insurer is impaired, the Commission shall issue an order requiring the insurer to eliminate the impairment within a period not exceeding ninety days. The Commission may by order served upon the insurer prohibit the insurer from issuing any new policies while the impairment exists.</p><p>B. Any domestic mutual insurer may make an assessment upon its assessable members for an amount that will provide funds to cover all or any part of the impairment.

The assessment shall be made upon each assessable member in proportion to the liability as expressed in the policy.
