The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney&#39;s fees.</p></li><li><p>The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p></li></ol><p>Article XIII.

Any Compact State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</p><ol><li><p>A Compact State&#39;s withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.</p></li><li><p>Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State&#39;s Psychology Regulatory Authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p></li></ol><p>D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Compact State and a Non-Compact State which does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.</p><p>E. This Compact may be amended by the Compact States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Compact State until it is enacted into the law of all Compact States.</p><p>Article XIV. Construction and Severability.</p><p>This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Compact States.</p><p>2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1162</a>.</p>',200),n=[s];function r(l,c,h,p,d,m){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const f=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
