Notwithstanding the requirements of Chapter 34 (§ <a href="/vacode/15.2-3400/">15.2-3400</a> et seq.), the member localities may agree to a revenue and economic growth-sharing arrangement with respect to tax revenues and other income and revenues generated by any facility owned by an authority or a facility owned by a non-authority utilized as part of a cooperative arrangement entered into by an authority promoting economic and workforce development. Such member localities may be located in any jurisdiction participating in the Appalachian Region Interstate Compact or a similar agreement for interstate cooperation for economic and workforce development authorized by law. The obligations of the parties to any such agreement shall not be construed to be debt within the meaning of Article VII, § 10 of the Constitution of Virginia. Any such agreement shall be approved by a majority vote of the governing bodies of the member localities reaching such an agreement but shall not require any other approval.</p><p>B. With any such revenue and economic growth-sharing arrangement entered into by localities, the Department of Taxation&#39;s calculation of true values as applied to the Commonwealth&#39;s composite index of local ability-to-pay shall take into account an agreement whereby a portion of real property tax revenue is initially paid to one locality and redistributed to another locality. Such calculation shall properly apportion the percentage of tax revenue ultimately received by each locality. Each participating locality shall include in reports to the Department of Taxation of its taxable real estate the apportioned fair market value of the property upon which such revenue sharing is based. The Department of Taxation shall collect annually, from each participating locality, the taxable real estate value used to determine and apportion the fair market value of the property adjustments upon which such revenue sharing is based.</p><p>1997, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">276</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">587</a>, § <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15</a>.1-1717; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">941</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">947</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">534</a>; 2022, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">230</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">231</a>.</p>',4),o=[n];function l(c,h,s,p,g,u){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const m=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
