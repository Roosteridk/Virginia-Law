In submitting the plan of conversion to the shareholders for their approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.</p></li><li><p>The board of directors may set conditions for approval of the plan of conversion by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of conversion.</p></li><li><p>If the approval of the shareholders is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of conversion is to be submitted for approval.
