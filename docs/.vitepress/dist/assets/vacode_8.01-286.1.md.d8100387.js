A defendant that, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver so requested is not required to serve a grounds of defense or other responsive pleading to the motion for judgment or other initial pleading until 60 days after the date on which the request for waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendant&#39;s address was outside the Commonwealth.</p><p>D. When the plaintiff files a waiver of service with the court, the action shall proceed as if a notice and motion for judgment or other initial pleading had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no proof of service shall be required.</p><p>E. The costs to be imposed on a defendant for failure to comply with a request to waive service of a summons shall include the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-299/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-299</a>, §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-301</a> through <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-306/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-306</a> or § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-320</a>, together with the costs, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, of any motion required to collect the costs of service.
