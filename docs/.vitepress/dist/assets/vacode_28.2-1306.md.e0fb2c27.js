It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct any activity which would require a permit under a wetlands zoning ordinance without such a permit. Until the county, city, or town in which a person proposes to conduct an activity which would require a permit under a wetlands zoning ordinance adopts the wetlands zoning ordinance, the person shall apply for a permit directly to the Commission, except as provided in subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28.2-1303</a>. If an applicant desires to use or develop wetlands owned by the Commonwealth, he shall apply for a permit directly to the Commission, and in addition to the application fee required by the wetlands zoning ordinance, he shall pay those fees and royalties assessed under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1206/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28.2-1206</a>.</p><p>B. Upon notification by any county, city, or town that it has adopted the wetlands zoning ordinance, the Commission shall immediately forward to that jurisdiction&#39;s wetlands board any pending permit application over which that board would have had jurisdiction if the ordinance had been in effect at the time the application was filed. However, if requested by the applicant, the application shall remain within the Commission&#39;s jurisdiction.</p><p>C. The Commission shall process permit applications in accordance with the provisions of the wetlands zoning ordinance and the Commissioner, or his authorized representative, shall sign such permit; however, the Commission may designate one or more hearing officers who may, in lieu of the Commission, conduct public hearings as required under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/28.2-1302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28.2-1302</a>, and thereafter report their findings and recommendations to the Commission.</p><p>1972, c. 711, §§ 62.1-13.5, 62.1-13.9; 1973, cc. 382, 388; 1975, c. 268; 1979, c. 418; 1982, c. 300; 1985, c. 541; 1988, c. 587; 1989, c. 360; 1992, c. 836; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">125</a>.</p>',5),r=[n];function s(c,d,h,l,p,m){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const _=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
