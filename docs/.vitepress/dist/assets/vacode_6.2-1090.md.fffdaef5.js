If the retention of stock or obligations of the association or its affiliates is authorized by the governing instrument or court order, the association may exercise rights to purchase its own stock or the stock of its affiliates, or securities convertible into such stock, when such rights are offered pro rata to all stockholders of the association or its affiliates, as the case may be. When the exercise of such rights or the receipt of a stock dividend results in fractional shareholdings, additional fractional shares may be purchased to complement the fractional shares so acquired. In elections of directors, shares of an association or its affiliates held by the association as sole fiduciary, whether in its own name as fiduciary or in the name of its nominee, may not be voted by the association or its nominee unless, under the terms of the governing instrument or a court order, the manner in which such shares shall be voted may be directed by a donor or beneficiary of the trust account, and the donor or beneficiary actually directs how the shares will be voted. In addition, where the association is acting as sole fiduciary with respect to a trust account containing voting shares of the association or its affiliates, the association may, in accordance with the provisions of subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1091/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">6.2-1091</a>, petition an appropriate court for appointment of a co-fiduciary for the purpose of voting such shares.</p><p>1984, c. 303, § 6.1-195.87; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>.</p>',6),r=[s];function n(c,h,l,f,d,p){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const m=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
