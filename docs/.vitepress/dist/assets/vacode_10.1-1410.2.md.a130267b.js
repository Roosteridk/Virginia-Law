At all times during the operational life of a solid waste landfill, the owner and operator shall provide to the Director satisfactory evidence of financial assurance consistent with all federal and state laws and regulations to ensure that the landfill will be:</p><ol><li><p>Closed in accordance with the Board&#39;s regulations and the closure plan approved for the landfill; and</p></li><li><p>Monitored and maintained after closure, for such period of time as provided in the Board&#39;s regulations or for such additional period as the Director shall determine is necessary, in accordance with a postclosure plan approved by the Director.</p></li></ol><p>B.

The certificate shall be accompanied by an evaluation, prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth and signed by the owner or operator, assessing and evaluating the landfill&#39;s potential for harm to human health and the environment in the event that postclosure monitoring and maintenance are discontinued.
