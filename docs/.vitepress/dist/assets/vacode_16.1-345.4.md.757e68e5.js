The return date for the civil show cause summons shall be set on a date prior to the review hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection A, and the examination of the minor shall be conducted immediately after the hearing thereon, but in no event shall the period for the examination exceed eight hours.</p><p>C. If the minor fails to appear for the hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations district court judge shall, after consideration of any evidence from the minor, from his parents, from the community services board, or from any treatment provider identified in the mandatory outpatient treatment plan regarding why the minor failed to appear at the hearing, either (i) reschedule the hearing pursuant to subsection A, (ii) issue an emergency custody order pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">16.1-340</a>, or (iii) issue a temporary detention order pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/16.1-340.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">16.1-340.1</a>.</p><p>D.
