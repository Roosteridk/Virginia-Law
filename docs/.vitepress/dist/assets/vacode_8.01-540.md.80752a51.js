If the plaintiff seeks the recovery of specific personal property, the attachment may be (i) against such property and against the principal defendant&#39;s estate for so much as is sufficient to satisfy the probable damages for its detention or (ii) at the option of the plaintiff, against the principal defendant&#39;s estate for the value of the specific property and the damages for its detention. If the plaintiff seeks to recover a debt or damages for the breach of a contract, express or implied, or damages for a wrong, the attachment shall be against the principal defendant&#39;s estate for the amount specified in the petition as that which the plaintiff at the least is entitled to or ought to recover.</p><p>If the attachment is issued by a magistrate, it shall be returnable as prescribed by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-541/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-541</a>. The magistrate shall promptly return to the clerk&#39;s office of the court to which the attachment is returnable the petition and the bond, if any, filed before him.
