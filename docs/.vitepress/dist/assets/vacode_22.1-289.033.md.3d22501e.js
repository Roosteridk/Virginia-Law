Administrative search warrants for inspections of child care operations, based upon a petition demonstrating probable cause and supported by an affidavit, may be issued ex parte by any judge having authority to issue criminal warrants whose territorial jurisdiction includes the child care operation to be inspected, if he is satisfied from the petition and affidavit that there is reasonable and probable cause for the inspection. The affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused, or that facts and circumstances exist reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Such facts may include, without limitation, past refusals to permit inspection or facts establishing reason to believe that seeking consent would provide an opportunity to conceal violations of statutes or regulations. Probable cause may be demonstrated by an affidavit showing probable cause to believe that the child care operation is in violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter, or upon a showing that the inspection is to be made pursuant to a reasonable administrative plan for the administration of this chapter. The inspection of a child care operation that has been the subject of a complaint pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/22.1-289.042/">22.1-289.042</a> shall have preeminent priority over any other inspections of child care operations to be made by the Superintendent unless the complaint on its face or in the context of information known to the Superintendent discloses that the complaint has been brought to harass, to retaliate, or otherwise to achieve an improper purpose, and that the improper purpose casts serious doubt on the veracity of the complaint. After issuing a warrant under this section, the judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § <a href="/vacode/19.2-54/">19.2-54</a>. Such warrant shall be executed and returned to the clerk of the circuit court of the city or county wherein the inspection was made.</p><p>2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">860</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">861</a>.</p>',3),r=[o];function s(c,h,p,d,l,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const m=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{b as __pageData,m as default};
