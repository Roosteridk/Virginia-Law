As used in this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning, &quot;nonresidential tenancy&quot; means the rental of any real estate for purposes other than residential use, including business, industrial, or agricultural purposes.</p><p>B. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all nonresidential tenancies. The lease or rental agreement controls the landlord-tenant relationship unless such lease or rental agreement is silent, in which case the provisions of this chapter apply. The right to evict a tenant whose right of possession has been terminated in any commercial or other nonresidential tenancy under this chapter may be effectuated by self-help eviction without further legal process so long as such eviction does not incite a breach of the peace. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude termination of any commercial or other nonresidential tenancy by the filing of an unlawful detainer action, entry of an order of possession, and eviction pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1416/">55.1-1416</a>.</p><p>Code 1919, § 5512; Code 1950, § 55-217; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">730</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',4),o=[r];function s(l,c,h,p,d,u){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{_ as __pageData,g as default};
