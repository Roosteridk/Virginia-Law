Either the qualified voters or the governing body of any county, city, town, or supervisor&#39;s election district of a county may file a petition with the circuit court of the county or city or of the county wherein the town or the greater part thereof is situated asking that a referendum be held on the question of whether the sale of beer and wine on Sunday should be permitted within that jurisdiction. The petition of voters shall be signed by qualified voters equal in number to at least ten percent of the number registered in the jurisdiction on January 1 preceding its filing or at least 100 qualified voters, whichever is greater. Upon the filing of a petition, the court shall order the election officials of the county, city, or town, on the date fixed in the order, to conduct a referendum on the question.
