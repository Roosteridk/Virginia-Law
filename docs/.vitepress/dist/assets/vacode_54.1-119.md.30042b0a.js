Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary and unless an applicant is found by the board to have engaged in any act that would constitute grounds for disciplinary action, a regulatory board within the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation or the Department of Health Professions or any other board named in this title shall expedite the issuance of a license, permit, certificate, or other document, however styled or denominated, required for the practice of any business, profession, or occupation in the Commonwealth to an applicant whose application has been deemed complete by the board and (i) who holds the same or similar license, permit, certificate, or other document required for the practice of any business, profession, or occupation issued by another jurisdiction; (ii) whose spouse is (a) on federal active duty orders pursuant to Title 10 of the United States Code or (b) a veteran, as that term is defined in § 2.2-2000.1, who has left active-duty service within one year of the submission of an application to a board; and (iii) who accompanies the applicant&#39;s spouse to the Commonwealth or an adjoining state or the District of Columbia, if, in the opinion of the board, the requirements for the issuance of the license, permit, certificate, or other document in such other jurisdiction are substantially equivalent to those required in the Commonwealth. A board may waive any requirement relating to experience if the board determines that the documentation provided by the applicant supports such a waiver.</p><p>B. If a board is unable to (i) complete the review of the documentation provided by the applicant or (ii) make a final determination regarding substantial equivalency within 20 days of the receipt of a completed application, the board shall issue a temporary license, permit, or certificate, provided the applicant otherwise meets the qualifications set out in subsection A. Any temporary license, permit, or certification issued pursuant to this subsection shall be limited for a period not to exceed 12 months and shall authorize the applicant to engage in the profession or occupation while the board completes its review of the documentation provided by the applicant or the applicant completes any specific requirements that may be required in Virginia that were not required in the jurisdiction in which the applicant holds the license, permit, or certificate.</p><p>C. The provisions of this section shall apply regardless of whether a regulatory board has entered into a reciprocal agreement with the other jurisdiction pursuant to subsection B of § <a href="/vacode/54.1-103/">54.1-103</a>.</p><p>D.
