Any registered voter may cancel his registration and have his name removed from the central registration records by signing an authorization for cancellation and mailing or otherwise submitting the signed authorization to the general registrar. When submitted by any means other than when notarized or in person, such cancellation must be made at least 22 days prior to an election in order to be valid in that election. The general registrar shall acknowledge receipt of the authorization and advise the voter in person or by first-class mail that his registration has been canceled within 10 days of receipt of such authorization.</p><p>B. The general registrar shall promptly cancel the registration of (i) all persons known by him to be deceased; (ii) all persons known by him to be disqualified to vote by reason of a felony conviction or adjudication of incapacity; (iii) all persons known by him not to be United States citizens by reason of reports from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/24.2-410.1/">24.2-410.1</a> or from the Department of Elections based on information received from the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE Program) pursuant to subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/24.2-404/">24.2-404</a> and in accordance with the requirements of subsection C; (iv) all persons for whom a notice has been received, signed by the voter, or from the registration official of another jurisdiction that the voter has moved from the Commonwealth; and (v) all persons for whom a notice has been received, signed by the voter, or from the registration official of another jurisdiction that the voter has registered to vote outside the Commonwealth, subsequent to his registration in Virginia. The notice received in clauses (iv) and (v) shall be considered as a written request from the voter to have his registration cancelled. A voter&#39;s registration may be cancelled at any time during the year in which the general registrar discovers that the person is no longer entitled to be registered. The general registrar shall provide notice of any cancellation to the person whose registration is cancelled, by mail to the address listed in the voter&#39;s registration record and by email to the email address provided on the voter&#39;s registration application, if one was provided.</p><p>C. The general registrar shall mail notice promptly to all persons known by him not to be United States citizens by reason of a report from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/24.2-410.1/">24.2-410.1</a> or from the Department of Elections based on information received from the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE Program) pursuant to subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/24.2-404/">24.2-404</a> prior to cancelling their registrations. The notice shall inform the person of the report from the Department of Motor Vehicles or from the Department of Elections and allow the person to submit his sworn statement that he is a United States citizen within 14 days of the date that the notice was mailed. The general registrar shall cancel the registrations of such persons who do not respond within 14 days to the notice that they have been reported not to be United States citizens.</p><p>D. The general registrar shall (i) process the Department&#39;s most recent list of persons convicted of felonies within 21 to 14 days before any primary or general election, (ii) cancel the registration of any registered voter shown to have been convicted of a felony who has not provided evidence that his right to vote has been restored, and (iii) send prompt notice to the person of the cancellation of his registration. If it appears that any registered voter has made a false statement on his registration application with respect to his having been convicted of a felony, the general registrar shall report the fact to the attorney for the Commonwealth for prosecution under § <a href="/vacode/24.2-1016/">24.2-1016</a> for a false statement made on his registration application.</p><p>E. The general registrar may cancel the registration of any person for whom a notice has been submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles in accordance with the Driver License Compact set out in Article 18 (§ 46.2-483 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 46.2 and forwarded to the general registrar, that the voter has moved from the Commonwealth; provided that the registrar shall mail notice of such cancellation to the person at both his new address, as reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the address at which he had most recently been registered in Virginia. No general registrar may cancel registrations under this authority while the registration records are closed pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/24.2-416/">24.2-416</a>. No registrar may cancel the registration under this authority of any person entitled to register under the provisions of subsection A of § <a href="/vacode/24.2-420.1/">24.2-420.1</a>, and shall reinstate the registration of any otherwise qualified voter covered by subsection A of § <a href="/vacode/24.2-420.1/">24.2-420.1</a> who applies to vote within four years of the date of cancellation.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 24-59, 24-60, 24-60.1, 24-71 through 24-73, 24-90, 24-93, 24-94, 24-101, 24-111; 1958, c. 576; 1962, cc. 422, 536; 1970, c. 462, § 24.1-46(12); 1972, c. 620; 1973, c. 30; 1974, c. 428; 1976, c. 616; 1979, c. 329; 1980, c. 639; 1982, c. 650; 1983, c. 398; 1984, c. 480; 1986, c. 558; 1990, c. 193; 1993, c. 641; 1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">72</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">73</a>; 1997, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">801</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">851</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">857</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">634</a>; 2002, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">785</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">819</a>; 2006 cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">926</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">940</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">318</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">382</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">686</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">686</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">740</a>; 2022, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">4</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">28</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">318</a>.</p>',7),n=[i];function s(l,h,c,f,g,d){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const b=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{v as __pageData,b as default};
