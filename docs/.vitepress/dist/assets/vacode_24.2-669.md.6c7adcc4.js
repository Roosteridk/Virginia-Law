After the counted ballots for any other election have remained in the clerk&#39;s office for one year, if no election contest or other proceeding is pending in which such ballots may be needed as evidence, the clerk shall destroy such ballots. After the unused ballots have remained in the clerk&#39;s office and the time has expired for initiating a recount, contest, or other proceeding in which such ballots may be needed as evidence and no such contest or proceeding is pending, the clerk may then destroy the unused ballots other than punchcard ballots, which shall be returned to the electoral board.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 24-268, 24-270; 1970, c. 462, § 24.1-144; 1973, c. 30; 1975, c. 515; 1978, c. 778; 1981, c. 425; 1992, c. 293; 1993, c. 641; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">270</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1015</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">689</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">565</a>; 2022, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">443</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">444</a>.</p>',4),n=[i];function l(c,s,h,d,p,f){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const g=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{b as __pageData,g as default};
