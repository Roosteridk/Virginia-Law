The notification may be in any form reasonable under the circumstances. However, in an access contract, a party may cancel rights of access without notice.</p><p>(c) On cancellation, the following rules apply:</p><p>(1) If a party is in possession or control of licensed information, documentation, materials, or copies of licensed information, the following rules apply:</p><p>(A) A party that has rightfully refused a copy shall comply with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-507.6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">59.1-507.6</a> (b) as to the refused copy.</p><p>(B) A party in breach of contract which would be subject to an obligation to deliver under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-506.18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">59.1-506.18</a>, shall deliver all information, documentation, materials, and copies to the other party or hold them with reasonable care for a reasonable time for disposal at that party&#39;s instructions.
