Pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection C and in addition to the authority for other disciplinary actions provided in this chapter, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may issue a summary order of suspension of the license of a residential or day school for students with disabilities, in conjunction with any proceeding for revocation, denial, or other action, when conditions or practices exist in the school that pose an immediate and substantial threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the students who are residing or attending the school and the Superintendent of Public Instruction believes the operation of the school should be suspended during the pendency of such proceeding.</p><p>C. The summary order of suspension shall take effect upon its issuance and shall be served on the licensee or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the licensee. The order shall state the time, date, and location of a hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by the Superintendent of Public Instruction or his designee.</p><p>After such hearing, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the licensee may appeal the Superintendent of Public Instruction&#39;s decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following issuance of the order. The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Superintendent of Public Instruction had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.</p><p>The willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Superintendent of Public Instruction may require the cooperation of any other agency or subdivision of the Commonwealth in the relocation of students who are residents of a home or facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to students.</p><p>Code 1950, § 22-330.27; 1970, c. 665; 1977, c. 444; 1980, c. 559; 1988, c. 574; 1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">691</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">832</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">991</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">168</a>.</p>',9),a=[r];function s(c,l,h,u,d,p){return t(),n("div",null,a)}const y=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
