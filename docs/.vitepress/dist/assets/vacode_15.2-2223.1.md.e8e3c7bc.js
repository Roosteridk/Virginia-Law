For purposes of this section:</p><p>&quot;Commercial&quot; means property devoted to usual and customary business purposes for the sale of goods and services and includes, but is not limited to, retail operations, hotels, motels and offices. &quot;Commercial&quot; does not include residential dwelling units, including apartments and condominiums, or agricultural or forestal production, or manufacturing, processing, assembling, storing, warehousing, or distributing.</p><p>&quot;Commission&quot; means the Commission on Local Government.</p><p>&quot;Developable acreage,&quot; solely for the purposes of calculating density within the urban development area, means land that is not included in (i) existing parks, rights-of-way of arterial and collector streets, railways, and public utilities and (ii) other existing public lands and facilities.</p><p>&quot;Population growth&quot; means the difference in population from the next-to-latest to the latest decennial census year, based on population reported by the United States Bureau of the Census. In computing its population growth, a locality may exclude the inmate population of any new or expanded correctional facility that opened within the time period between the two censuses.</p><p>&quot;Urban development area&quot; means an area designated by a locality that is (i) appropriate for higher density development due to its proximity to transportation facilities, the availability of a public or community water and sewer system, or a developed area and (ii) to the extent feasible, to be used for redevelopment or infill development.</p><p>B. Any locality may amend its comprehensive plan to incorporate one or more urban development areas.</p><ol><li><p>Urban development areas are areas that may be appropriate for development at a density on the developable acreage of at least four single-family residences, six townhouses, or 12 apartments, condominium units, or cooperative units per acre, and an authorized floor area ratio of at least 0.4 per acre for commercial development, any proportional combination thereof, or any other combination or arrangement that is adopted by a locality in meeting the intent of this section.</p></li><li><p>The urban development areas designated by a locality may be sufficient to meet projected residential and commercial growth in the locality for an ensuing period of at least 10 but not more than 20 years, which may include phasing of development within the urban development areas. Where an urban development area in a county with the urban county executive form of government includes planned or existing rail transit, the planning horizon may be for an ensuing period of at least 10 but not more than 40 years. Future residential and commercial growth shall be based on official estimates of either the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia, the Virginia Employment Commission, the United States Bureau of the Census, or other official government projections required for federal transportation planning purposes.</p></li><li><p>The boundaries and size of each urban development area shall be reexamined and, if necessary, revised every five years in conjunction with the review of the comprehensive plan and in accordance with the most recent available population growth estimates and projections.</p></li><li><p>The boundaries of each urban development area shall be identified in the locality&#39;s comprehensive plan and shall be shown on future land use maps contained in such comprehensive plan.</p></li><li><p>Urban development areas, if designated, shall incorporate principles of traditional neighborhood design, which may include but need not be limited to (i) pedestrian-friendly road design, (ii) interconnection of new local streets with existing local streets and roads, (iii) connectivity of road and pedestrian networks, (iv) preservation of natural areas, (v) mixed-use neighborhoods, including mixed housing types, with affordable housing to meet the projected family income distributions of future residential growth, (vi) reduction of front and side yard building setbacks, and (vii) reduction of subdivision street widths and turning radii at subdivision street intersections.</p></li><li><p>The comprehensive plan shall describe any financial and other incentives for development in the urban development areas.</p></li><li><p>A portion of one or more urban development areas may be designated as a receiving area for any transfer of development rights program established by the locality.</p></li></ol><p>C. No locality that has amended its comprehensive plan in accordance with this section shall limit or prohibit development pursuant to existing zoning or shall refuse to consider any application for rezoning based solely on the fact that the property is located outside the urban development area.</p><p>D. Localities shall consult with adjacent localities, as well as the relevant planning district commission and metropolitan planning organization, in establishing the appropriate size and location of urban development areas to promote orderly and efficient development of their region.</p><p>E. Any county that amends its comprehensive plan pursuant to subsection B may designate one or more urban development areas in any incorporated town within such county, if the council of the town has also amended its comprehensive plan to designate the same areas as urban development areas with at least the same density designated by the county. However, if a town has established an urban development area within its corporate boundaries, the county within which the town is located shall not include the town&#39;s projected population and commercial growth when initially determining or reexamining the size and boundary of any other urban development area within the county.</p><p>F. To the extent possible, federal, state and local transportation, housing, water and sewer facility, economic development, and other public infrastructure funding for new and expanded facilities shall be directed to designated urban development areas or to such similar areas that accommodate growth in a manner consistent with this section.</p><p>2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">896</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">327</a>; 2010, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">465</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">528</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">561</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">192</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">518</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">836</a>.</p>',14),r=[o];function s(l,d,p,c,h,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
