A locality may petition the Board at any time for approval to change from fully administering a VESMP pursuant to subdivision B 1 to administering a VESMP in coordination with the Department pursuant to subdivision B 2 due to a significant change in economic conditions or other fiscal emergency in the locality.

Such fee may be in addition to any fee charged pursuant to the statewide fee schedule established in accordance with subdivision 9 of § <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:28/">62.1-44.15:28</a>, although payment of fees may be consolidated in order to provide greater convenience and efficiency for those responsible for compliance with the program.

The Board shall approve a VESMP when it deems a program consistent with this article and associated regulations.</p><p>J. A VESMP authority may enter into agreements or contracts with the Department, soil and water conservation districts, adjacent localities, planning district commissions, or other public or private entities to carry out or assist with plan review and inspections. A VESMP authority may enter into contracts with third-party professionals who hold certifications in the appropriate subject areas, as provided in subsection A of § <a href="/vacode/62.1-44.15:30/">62.1-44.15:30</a>, to carry out any or all of the responsibilities that this article requires of a VESMP authority, including plan review and inspection but not including enforcement.</p><p>K.
