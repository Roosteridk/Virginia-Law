All fees in this article shall be deposited in the Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund, referred to in this article as &quot;the Fund.&quot; The Fund shall be a special fund in the state treasury to pay claims against the Fund and for no other purpose, provided that any such payment does not result in a negative balance of the Fund, except the Board may expend moneys for the administration of this article up to the maximum amount authorized for consumer assistance in the general appropriation act, provided the amount expended for administration does not result in a balance of the Fund of less than $250,000. The Fund shall be used to satisfy unpaid judgments, as provided for in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1527.3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-1527.3</a>. Any interest income shall accrue to the Fund. The Board shall maintain an accurate record of all transactions involving the Fund. The Board may levy a special assessment on all dealers participating in the Fund to pay claims against the Fund and to maintain a minimum Fund balance that is in its judgment adequate. The Board may choose to await a positive balance in the Fund to pay claims ready for payment in chronological order, provided such claims do not go unpaid for more than 60 days.</p><p>B.

Only those renewing licensees who have not been the subject of a claim against their bond or against the Fund for three consecutive years shall pay the annual $100 fee and will no longer be required to pay the $350 annual fee or hold the $50,000 bond.
