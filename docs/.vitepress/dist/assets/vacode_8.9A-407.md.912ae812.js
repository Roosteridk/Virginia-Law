The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor&#39;s interest under the lease contract or the lessor&#39;s residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee&#39;s prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.2A-303</a> (4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.</p><p>1991, c. 536, § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.2A-303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.2A-303</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1007</a>.</p>',9),s=[n];function a(c,l,h,f,d,p){return t(),r("div",null,s)}const _=e(i,[["render",a]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
