The amount of tax credit carried over from prior years.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>If on March 15 of each year the $3.2 million amount of credit is not fully allocated among qualifying taxpayers, then those taxpayers who have been allocated a credit for the prior year shall be allowed a pro rata share of the remaining allocated credit up to $3.2 million. If on March 15 of each year, the cumulative amount of tax credits requested by qualifying taxpayers for the prior year exceeds $3.2 million, then the $3.2 million in credits shall be prorated among the qualifying taxpayers who requested the credit.</p></li><li><p>The taxpayer shall claim the credit on its income tax return in a manner prescribed by the Department. The Department may require a copy of the certification form issued by the Virginia Port Authority be attached to the return or otherwise provided. Qualifying taxpayers may also claim the credit pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/58.1-439.12:09/">58.1-439.12:09</a> for the same containers, noncontainerized cargo, or roll-on/roll-off units of cargo for which a credit is claimed under this section provided such taxpayer meets the applicable criteria set forth therein.</p></li></ol><p>D. 1.

The transferred credits may be retroactively applied from the date such credits were originally issued, and the transferee may file an amended return under this chapter to claim such transferred credit for a prior tax year.
