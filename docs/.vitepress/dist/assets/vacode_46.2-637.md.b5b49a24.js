In such cases, the owner shall file an application with the Department on a form furnished for that purpose, setting forth the security interests and whatever additional information the Department may deem necessary. If satisfied that it is proper for the security interest to be recorded, when the certificate of title covering the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, is surrendered, the Department shall issue a new certificate of title, showing security interests in the order of their priority according to the date of the filing of the application. For the purpose of recording a subsequent security interest, the Commissioner may require any secured party to deliver to him the certificate of title. The new certificate shall be sent or delivered to the secured party from whom the prior certificate was obtained. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a security interest in a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which is inventory held for sale shall be perfected only as provided in §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.9A-301</a> through <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-527/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.9A-527</a>.</p><p>Code 1950, § 46-70; 1958, c. 541, § 46.1-70; 1966, c. 558; 1989, c. 727; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">896</a>.</p>',3),s=[o];function n(c,h,l,d,f,u){return t(),r("div",null,s)}const m=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{_ as __pageData,m as default};
