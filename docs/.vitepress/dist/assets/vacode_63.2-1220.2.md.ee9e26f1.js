In any proceeding for adoption pursuant to this chapter, the birth parent(s) and the adoptive parent(s) of a child may enter into a written post-adoption contact and communication agreement. A post-adoption contact and communication agreement may include, but is not limited to, provisions related to contact and communication between the child, the birth parent(s), and the adoptive parent(s) and provisions for the sharing of information about the child, including sharing of photographs of the child and information about the child&#39;s education, health, and welfare. Unless the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated pursuant to subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/16.1-283/">16.1-283</a>, a local board of social services or child welfare agency required to file a petition for a permanency planning hearing pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/16.1-282.1/">16.1-282.1</a> may inform the birth parent or parents and shall inform the adoptive parent or parents that they may enter into such an agreement and shall inform the child if he is 14 years of age or older that he may consent to such an agreement.</p><p>B. Any post-adoption contact and communication agreement entered into by the birth parent(s) and the adoptive parent(s) of a child shall include acknowledgment by the birth parent(s) that the adoption of the child is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parent(s) do not abide by the post-adoption contact and communication agreement, and acknowledgment by the adoptive parent(s) that the agreement grants the birth parent(s) the right to seek to enforce the post-adoption contact and communication provisions set forth in the agreement. The petitioner for adoption shall file such agreement with other documents filed in the circuit court having jurisdiction over the child&#39;s adoption.</p><p>C. In no event shall failure to enter into a post-adoption contact and communication agreement with identified adoptive parent(s) after a valid entrustment agreement or consent to the child&#39;s adoption is executed, or failure to comply with a post-adoption contact and communication agreement, affect the validity of (i) the consent to the adoption, (ii) the voluntary relinquishment of parental rights, (iii) the voluntary or involuntary termination of parental rights, or (iv) the finality of the adoption.</p><p>D. No birth parent(s) or adoptive parent(s) of a child shall be required to enter into a post-adoption contact and communication agreement.</p><p>2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">331</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">65</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">84</a>.</p>',6),r=[i];function c(h,s,d,p,l,m){return e(),a("div",null,r)}const g=t(o,[["render",c]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
