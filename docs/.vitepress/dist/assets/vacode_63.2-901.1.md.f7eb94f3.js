Each local board and licensed child-placing agency shall obtain, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, criminal history record information from the Central Criminal Records Exchange and the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the Central Criminal Records Exchange and the results of a search of the child abuse and neglect central registry of any individual with whom the local board or licensed child-placing agency is considering placing a child on an emergency, temporary or permanent basis, including the birth parent of a child in foster care placement, unless the birth parent has revoked an entrustment agreement pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1223/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1223</a> or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1817</a> or a local board or birth parent revokes a placement agreement while legal custody remains with the parent, parents, or guardians pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-900</a>. The local board or licensed child-placing agency shall also obtain such background checks on all adult household members residing in the home of the individual with whom the child is to be placed pursuant to subsection B. Such state criminal records or registry search shall be at no cost to the individual. The local board or licensed child-placing agency shall pay for the national fingerprint criminal history record check or may require such individual to pay the cost of the fingerprinting or the national fingerprinting criminal history record check or both. In addition to the fees assessed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the designated state agency may assess a fee for responding to requests required by this section.</p><p>B. Background checks pursuant to this section require the following:</p><ol><li><p>A sworn statement or affirmation disclosing whether or not the individual has a criminal conviction or is the subject of any pending criminal charges within or outside the Commonwealth and whether or not the individual has been the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect within or outside the Commonwealth;</p></li><li><p>That the individual submit to fingerprinting and provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the individual&#39;s fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information. The local board or licensed child-placing agency shall inform the individual that he is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report and to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any such report and obtain a prompt resolution before a final decision is made of the individual&#39;s fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children.</p></li></ol><p>The Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an individual&#39;s record or notification that no record exists, shall forward it to the designated state agency. The state agency shall, upon receipt of an individual&#39;s record lacking disposition data, conduct research in whatever state and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data. The state agency shall report to the local board or licensed child-placing agency whether the individual meets the criteria for having responsibility for the safety and well-being of children based on whether or not the individual has ever been convicted of or is the subject of pending charges for any barrier crime as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-392.02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-392.02</a>.

In emergency circumstances, each local board may obtain, from a criminal justice agency, criminal history record information from the Central Criminal Records Exchange and the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) for the criminal records search authorized by this section. Within three days of placing a child, the local board shall require the individual for whom a criminal history record information check was requested to submit to fingerprinting and provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal record history information, pursuant to subsection B. The child shall be removed from the home immediately if any adult resident fails to provide such fingerprints and written permission to perform a criminal history record check when requested.</p><p>D. Any individual with whom the local board is considering placing a child on an emergency basis shall submit to a search of the central registry maintained pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/63.2-1515/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63.2-1515</a> and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-248 for any founded complaint of child abuse or neglect. The search of the central registry must occur prior to emergency placement.

A local board or child-placing agency may approve as a kinship foster care parent an applicant who has been convicted of the following offenses, provided that 10 years have elapsed from the date of the conviction and the local board or child-placing agency makes a specific finding that approving the kinship foster care placement would not adversely affect the safety and well-being of the child: (i) any offense set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of barrier crime in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-392.02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-392.02</a> or (ii) any misdemeanor offense under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-80</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-81/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-81</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-83/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-83</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-87/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-87</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-87.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-87.1</a>, or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-88/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-88</a> or any substantially similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction.</p><p>G.

The results of such background check shall be used for the sole purpose of determining whether other children should be placed or remain in the same foster home as the individual subject to the background check. The results of the background check shall not be used to terminate or suspend the approval of the foster home pursuant to subsection E. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;individual participating in the Fostering Futures program&quot; means a person who is 18 years of age or older but has not reached 21 years of age and is receiving foster care services through the Fostering Futures program.</p><p>2002, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">587</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">606</a>, § 63.1-56.01; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">722</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">558</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">606</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">617</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">623</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">871</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">5</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">156</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">568</a>; 2017, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">194</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">809</a>.</p>',12),o=[n];function l(s,h,c,d,g,f){return a(),r("div",null,o)}const v=e(t,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,v as default};
