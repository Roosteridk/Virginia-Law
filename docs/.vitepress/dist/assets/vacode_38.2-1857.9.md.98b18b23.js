An individual or business entity who is not a resident as defined in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-1800/">38.2-1800</a>, but who is a resident of another state, territory, or province of Canada, shall receive a nonresident surplus lines broker license if:</p><ol><li><p>The applicant presents proof in a form acceptable to the Commission that the applicant is currently licensed or otherwise authorized as a resident surplus lines broker and is in good standing in his home state;</p></li><li><p>The applicant has submitted the proper application for licensure, or in lieu thereof has submitted a copy of the application for a Surplus Lines Broker license submitted to the home state, and has paid the fees prescribed by the Commission; and</p></li><li><p>The applicant&#39;s home state issues nonresident surplus lines broker licenses to residents of the Commonwealth on the same basis, or will permit a resident of the Commonwealth to act as a surplus lines broker in such state without requiring a license.</p></li></ol><p>B. For the purposes of this article, any individual whose place of residence and place of business are in a city or town located partly within the Commonwealth and partly within another state may be considered as meeting the requirements as a resident of the Commonwealth, provided the other state has established by law or regulation similar requirements as to residence of such individuals.</p><p>C.
