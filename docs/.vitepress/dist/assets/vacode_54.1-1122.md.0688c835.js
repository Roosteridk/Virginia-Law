The claimant shall submit the following supporting documentation with the claim:</p><ol><li><p>Copies of the contract with the regulant and all written change orders to the contract. If no written contract between the regulant and the claimant is available, the claimant may submit an affidavit attesting to the terms of the agreement, promise, or other contractual obligation;</p></li><li><p>All pleadings or other documents filed with the court from which judgment was obtained;</p></li><li><p>All orders and opinions of the court from which judgment was obtained, including the final judgment order;</p></li><li><p>The transcript of the debtor&#39;s interrogatories, if conducted, or if no transcript is available, a sworn affidavit affirming that debtor&#39;s interrogatories were conducted, or evidence that debtor&#39;s interrogatories were attempted if not conducted; a description of assets of the judgment debtor disclosed in the debtor&#39;s interrogatories; and a description of all steps taken for the sale or application of those disclosed assets in whole or partial satisfaction of the judgment, or a statement why no means are legally available for the sale or application of those disclosed assets, or a statement that the value of the disclosed assets is less than the cost of levying upon and selling such assets including reasonable estimates of the fair market value of the disclosed assets and costs of levying upon selling such assets;</p></li><li><p>A statement of the balance of the judgment remaining unpaid at the time the claim is submitted to the Department, and a statement that the claimant agrees to notify the Department of any additional payment that may be received in whole or partial satisfaction of the judgment during the pendency of the claim before the Board; and</p></li><li><p>Any other documentary evidence or exhibits the claimant wishes the Board to consider with the claim.</p></li></ol><p>B. The Department shall promptly consider the verified claim of the claimant administratively. If the claim form is incomplete or not properly notarized, or if all required supporting documentation is not included with the claim, then the Department may provide the claimant with notice of any deficiency and an additional opportunity to submit a corrected verified claim. The burden shall be on the claimant to comply with all claim requirements and to submit the necessary documentation within 12 months of the initial claim submission. Once the Department confirms that the verified claim is complete, it shall present such verified claim, along with a recommendation regarding payment, to the Board for the Board&#39;s consideration and shall notify the claimant of the Board&#39;s recommendation.</p><p>C. The Department&#39;s and Board&#39;s consideration of the claim shall be based solely on the contents of the verified claim. Neither an informal fact-finding conference pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4019</a> nor a formal hearing pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4020</a> shall be required, unless requested by the claimant.</p><p>D. A claimant shall not be denied recovery from the Fund due to the fact that order for judgment filed with the verified claim does not contain a specific finding of &quot;improper or dishonest conduct.&quot; Any language in the order that supports the conclusion that the court found that the conduct of the regulant meets the definition of &quot;improper or dishonest conduct&quot; in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-1118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">54.1-1118</a> shall be used by the Board to determine eligibility for recovery from the Fund. To the extent the judgment order is silent as to the court&#39;s findings on the conduct of the regulant, the Board may determine whether the conduct of the regulant meets the definition of improper or dishonest conduct by substantial evidence in the verified claim.</p><p>E. If the Board finds there has been compliance with the required conditions, the Board shall issue a directive ordering payment from the fund to the claimant the amount remaining unpaid on the judgment, subject to the limitations set forth in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-1123/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">54.1-1123</a>. The claimant shall be notified in writing of the findings of the Board. The Board&#39;s findings shall be considered a &quot;case decision&quot; and judicial review of these findings shall be in accordance with § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4025</a> of the Administrative Process Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4000</a> et seq.). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board shall have the right to appeal a decision of any court which is contrary to any distribution recommended or authorized by it.</p><p>1980, c. 635, § 54-145.3:4; 1984, c. 270; 1987, c. 555; 1988, c. 765; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">723</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">343</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">572</a>.</p>',8),r=[n];function s(l,h,d,c,f,m){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const g=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
