The fees paid into the state treasury under this section and the fees collected under § <a href="/vacode/13.1-1005/">13.1-1005</a> shall be set aside and paid into the special fund created under § <a href="/vacode/13.1-775.1/">13.1-775.1</a>, and shall be used only by the Commission as it deems necessary to defray the costs of the Commission and of the office of the clerk of the Commission in supervising, implementing, administering and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. The projected excess of fees collected over the costs of administration and enforcement so incurred shall be paid into the general fund prior to the close of each fiscal year, based on the unexpended balance of the special fund at the end of the prior fiscal year. An adjustment of this transfer amount to reflect actual fees collected shall occur during the first quarter of the succeeding fiscal year.
