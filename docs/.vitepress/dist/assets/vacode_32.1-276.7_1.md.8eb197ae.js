Except as provided in subsection O, the nonprofit organization shall not provide data or access to data without the approval of the data release committee. Upon approval, the nonprofit organization may provide data or access to data at levels of detail that may include (i) aggregate reports, which are defined as data releases with all observation counts greater than 10; (ii) de-identified data sets that meet the standard set forth in 45 C.F.R. § 164.514(a); and (iii) limited data sets that comply with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for release of personal health information.</p><p>I. Reporting of data shall not commence until such data has been processed and verified at levels of accuracy consistent with existing nonprofit organization data standards. Prior to public release of any report specifically naming any provider or payer, or public reports in which an individual provider or payers represents 60 percent or more of the data, the nonprofit organization shall provide affected entities with notice of the pending report and allow for a 30-day period of review to ensure accuracy. During this period, affected entities may seek explanations of results and correction of data that they prove to be inaccurate.

At the end of the review period, upon completion of all necessary corrections, the report may be released. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;public release&quot; means the release of any report to the general public and does not include the preparation of reports for, or use of the All-Payer Claims Database by, organizations that have been approved for access by the data release committee and have entered into written agreements with the nonprofit organization.</p><p>J.

The nonprofit organization, the Department of Health, the Department of Medical Assistance Services, and the Bureau of Insurance shall have access to data reported by the All-Payer Claims Database pursuant to this section at no cost for the purposes of public health improvement research and activities.</p><p>P. Each employer that maintains an ERISA plan may opt-in to allow a third-party administer or other entity to submit data to the All-Payer Claims Database. For any such employer that opts-in, the third-party administrator or other entity shall (i) submit data for the next reporting period after the opt-in and all future reporting periods until the employer opts-out and (ii) include data from any such employer as part of its data submission, if any, otherwise required by this section. Such an employer may opt-out at any time but shall provide written notice to the third-party administrator or other entity of its decision at least 30 days prior to the start of the next reporting period. No employer that maintains an ERISA plan shall be required to opt-in to data submission to the All-Payer Claims Database, and no third-party administrator or other entity shall be required to submit claims processed before it was contracted to provide services. Each third-party administrator or other entity providing claim administration services for an employer shall submit annually to the nonprofit organization by January 31 of each year a list of the ERISA plans whose employer has opted-in to data submission to the All-Payer Claims Database and a list identifying all employers that maintain an ERISA plan with Virginia employees for which it provides claim administration services. Such information submitted shall be considered proprietary and shall be exempt from disclosure by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ <a href="/vacode/2.2-3700/">2.2-3700</a> et seq.).</p><p>Q. Any data release shall make use of a masked proxy reimbursement amount, for which the methodology is publicly available and approved by the data release committee except that the Department may request that the nonprofit organization generate the following reports based on actual reimbursement amounts: (i) the total cost burden of a disease, chronic disease, injury, or health condition across the state, health planning region, health planning district, county, or city, provided that the total cost shall be an aggregate amount encompassing costs attributable to all data suppliers and not identifying or attributable to any individual provider, and (ii) any analyses to determine the average reimbursement that is paid for health care services that may include inpatient and outpatient diagnostic services, surgical services or the treatment of certain conditions or diseases. Any additional report of analysis based on actual reimbursement amounts shall require the approval of the data release committee.</p><p>R. The nonprofit organization shall ensure the timely reporting of information by private data suppliers to meet the requirements of this section. The nonprofit organization shall notify private data suppliers of any applicable reporting deadlines. The nonprofit shall notify, in writing, a private data supplier of a failure to meet a reporting deadline, and that failure to respond within two weeks following receipt of the written notice may result in a penalty. The Board may assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per week per violation, not to exceed a total of $50,000 per violation, against a private data supplier that fails, within its determination, to make a good faith effort to provide the requested information within two weeks following receipt of the written notice required by this subsection. Civil penalties assessed under this subsection shall be maintained by the Department and used for the ongoing improvement of the All-Payer Claims Database.</p><p>2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">693</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">709</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">672</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">673</a>.</p>',27),n=[r];function s(l,d,h,p,c,m){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const y=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,y as default};
