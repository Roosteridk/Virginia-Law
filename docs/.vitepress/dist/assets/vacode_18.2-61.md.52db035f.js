If any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in sexual intercourse with any other person and such act is accomplished (i) against the complaining witness&#39;s will, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness or another person; or (ii) through the use of the complaining witness&#39;s mental incapacity or physical helplessness; or (iii) with a child under age 13 as the victim, he or she shall be guilty of rape.</p><p>B.

If the term of confinement imposed for any violation of clause (iii) of subsection A, where the offender is more than three years older than the victim, is for a term less than life imprisonment, the judge shall impose, in addition to any active sentence, a suspended sentence of no less than 40 years. This suspended sentence shall be suspended for the remainder of the defendant&#39;s life, subject to revocation by the court.</p><p>There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a juvenile over the age of 10 but less than 12, does not possess the physical capacity to commit a violation of this section.

Upon a finding of guilt under this section, when a spouse is the complaining witness in any case tried by the court without a jury, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant who has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of this section dismissed pursuant to this subsection and with the consent of the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth, may defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation pending completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-218.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-218.1</a>. If the defendant fails to so complete such counseling or therapy, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If such counseling is completed as prescribed under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-218.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19.2-218.1</a>, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witness and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.</p><p>Code 1950, § 18.1-44; 1960, c. 358; 1972, c. 394; 1975, cc. 14, 15, 606; 1981, c. 397; 1982, c. 506; 1986, c. 516; 1994, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">339</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">772</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>; 1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">330</a>; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">367</a>; 2002, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">810</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">818</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">631</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">853</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">914</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">575</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">605</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">761</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">774</a>.</p>',8),o=[n];function s(l,h,c,f,p,g){return i(),t("div",null,o)}const m=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
