A vacancy in any elected local office, whether occurring when for any reason an officer-elect does not take office or occurring after an officer begins his term, shall be filled as provided by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-228/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-228</a> or for constitutional officers as provided in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-228.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-228.1</a>, or unless provided otherwise by statute or charter requiring special elections within the time limits provided in this title. The governing body or, in the case of an elected school board, the school board of the county, city, or town in which the vacancy occurs shall, within 15 days of the occurrence of the vacancy, petition the circuit court to issue a writ of election to fill the vacancy as set forth in Article 5 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-681</a> et seq.) of Chapter 6. Either upon receipt of the petition or on its own motion, the court shall issue the writ ordering the election promptly and shall order the special election to be held on the date of the next general election in November or in May if the vacant office is regularly scheduled by law to be filled in May. However, if the governing body or the school board requests in its petition a different date for the election, the court shall order the special election be held on that date, so long as the date requested precedes the date of such next general election and complies with the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-682/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-682</a>. If the vacancy occurs within 90 days of the next such general election and the governing body or the school board has not requested in its petition a different date for the election, the special election shall be held on the date of the second such general election. Upon receipt of written notification by an officer or officer-elect of his resignation as of a stated date, the governing body or school board, as the case may be, may immediately petition the circuit court to issue a writ of election, and the court may immediately issue the writ to call the election. The officer&#39;s or officer-elect&#39;s resignation shall not be revocable after the date stated by him for his resignation or after the forty-fifth day before the date set for the special election. The person so elected shall hold the office for the remaining portion of the regular term of the office for which the vacancy is being filled.</p><p>B. Notwithstanding any provision of law or charter to the contrary, no election to fill a vacancy shall be ordered or held if the general election at which it is to be called is scheduled within 60 days of the end of the term of the office to be filled.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding any provision of law or charter to the contrary, when an interim appointment to a vacancy in any governing body or elected school board has been made by the remaining members thereof, no election to fill the vacancy shall be ordered or held if the general election at which it is to be called is scheduled in the year in which the term expires.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 24-145, 24-147.1; 1958, c. 621; 1970, c. 462, §§ 24.1-76, 24.1-79; 1975, c. 515; 1976, c. 616; 1977, c. 490; 1984, c. 480; 1993, c. 641; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">873</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">787</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1045</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1070</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1015</a>; 2010, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">431</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">449</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">645</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">206</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">476</a>.</p>',5),n=[a];function l(c,h,s,f,d,g){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const b=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{v as __pageData,b as default};
