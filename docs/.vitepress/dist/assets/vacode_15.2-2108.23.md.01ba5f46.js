To the extent that a franchised cable operator has been authorized to use the public rights-of-way in a locality and is obligated to pay a franchise fee to such locality, such cable operator shall not be subject to any occupancy, use, or similar fee, with respect to its use of such rights-of-way, by the locality or the Commonwealth Transportation Board except to the extent that such cable operator is also a certificated provider of telecommunications services and subject to the public rights-of-way use fee under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-468.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">56-468.1</a>.
