Subject to the limitations provided in § <a href="/vacode/33.2-119/">33.2-119</a> and in accordance with all applicable federal and state statutes and requirements, the Board may impose and collect tolls from all classes of vehicles in amounts established by the Board for the use of any component of the Interstate System within the Commonwealth.</p><p>B. The toll facilities authorized by this section shall be subject to the provisions of federal law for the purpose of tolling motor vehicles to finance interstate construction and reconstruction, promote efficiency in the use of highways, reduce traffic congestion, and improve air quality and for such other purposes as may be permitted by federal law.</p><p>C. In order to mitigate traffic congestion in the vicinity of the toll facilities, no toll facility shall be operated without high-speed automated toll collection technology designed to allow motorists to travel through the toll facilities without stopping to make payments. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a toll facility from retaining means of nonautomated toll collection in some lanes of the facility. The Board shall also consider traffic congestion and mitigation thereof and the impact on local traffic movement as factors in determining the location of the toll facilities authorized pursuant to this section.</p><p>D. The revenues collected from each toll facility established pursuant to this section shall be deposited into segregated subaccounts in the Transportation Trust Fund and may be allocated by the Board as the Board deems appropriate to:</p><ol><li><p>Pay or finance all or part of the costs of programs or projects, including the costs of planning, operation, maintenance, and improvements incurred in connection with the toll facility, provided that such allocations shall be limited to programs and projects that are reasonably related to or benefit the users of the toll facility. The priorities of metropolitan planning organizations, planning district commissions, local governments, and transportation corridors shall be considered by the Board in making project allocations from such revenues deposited into the Transportation Trust Fund.</p></li><li><p>Repay funds from the Toll Facilities Revolving Account or the Transportation Partnership Opportunity Fund.</p></li><li><p>Pay the Board&#39;s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the administration and management of the toll facility.</p></li></ol><p>2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">477</a>, § <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">33</a>.1-23.03 <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0:10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">:10</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">602</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">838</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">805</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">681</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">780</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">836</a>.</p>',7),n=[r];function l(s,c,h,f,p,d){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const u=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
