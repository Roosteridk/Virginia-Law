Based on this recommendation, the court may take custody and place the child, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 5 of § <a href="/vacode/16.1-278.4/">16.1-278.4</a> or subdivision A 13 b of § <a href="/vacode/16.1-278.8/">16.1-278.8</a>, in a private or locally operated public facility, or nonresidential program with funding in accordance with the Children&#39;s Services Act (§ <a href="/vacode/2.2-5200/">2.2-5200</a> et seq.).
