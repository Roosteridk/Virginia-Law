Remote sensing equipment may include devices to detect and record the vehicle&#39;s registration or other identification numbers.</p><p>&quot;Test and repair&quot; means motor vehicle emissions inspection facilities that perform official motor vehicle emissions inspections and may also perform vehicle repairs. No regulation of the Board pertaining to test and repair shall bar inspection facilities from also performing vehicle repairs. Emissions inspections and vehicle safety inspections may be performed in the same service bay, provided that the facility is both an emissions inspection station and an official safety inspection station pursuant to §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-1163</a> and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1166/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-1166</a>.
