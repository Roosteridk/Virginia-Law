A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration, or certificate-of-title system covering the collateral. If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall:</p><p>(1) accept the transfer statement;</p><p>(2) promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and</p><p>(3) if applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee.</p><p>(c) Transfer not a disposition; no relief of secured party&#39;s duties.
