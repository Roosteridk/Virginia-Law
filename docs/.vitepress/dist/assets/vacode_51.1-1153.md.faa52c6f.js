All eligible employees shall become participants in this program, provided, however, that the governing body of an employer may adopt a resolution on or before January 1, 2014, which shall be submitted to the Board, requesting that its eligible employees not participate in the program because the employer has or will establish, and continue to maintain, comparable disability coverage for such eligible employees. The election by the governing body of an employer not to participate in this program shall be irrevocable. The employer need not consider the provisions of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-1178/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-1178</a> when determining the comparability of its disability coverage to this program. As the context requires, the term &quot;participating employee&quot; includes the employees of an employer electing not to participate in the program under this subdivision.</p><p>B. The effective date of participation in the program for participating employees shall be their first day of employment or the effective date of their participation in the hybrid retirement program described in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-169/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-169</a>, whichever is later.</p><p>C.

Eligibility for participation in the program shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of an employee&#39;s (i) termination of employment or (ii) death. Eligibility for participation in the program shall be suspended during periods that an employee is placed on nonpay status, including leave without pay, if such nonpay status is due to suspension pending investigation or outcome of employment-related court or disciplinary action.</p><p>2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">701</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">823</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">356</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">660</a>.</p>',6),n=[o];function p(l,s,c,h,g,m){return i(),t("div",null,n)}const u=e(a,[["render",p]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
