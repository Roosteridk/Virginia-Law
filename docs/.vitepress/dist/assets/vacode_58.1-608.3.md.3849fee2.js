Such entitlement shall continue for the lifetime of such bonds, or any refinancing or refunding thereof, but in no event shall such entitlement exceed 35 years from the initial date that any bonds were issued to pay the cost, or a portion thereof, of any public facility, and all such sales tax revenues shall be applied to repayment of the bonds. The State Comptroller shall remit such sales tax revenues to the municipality on a quarterly basis, subject to such reasonable processing delays as may be required by the Department of Taxation to calculate the actual net sales tax revenues derived from the public facility. The State Comptroller shall make such remittances to eligible municipalities, as provided herein, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Virginia Retail Sales and Use Tax Act (§ <a href="/vacode/58.1-600/">58.1-600</a> et seq.). No such remittances shall be made until construction is completed and, in the case of a renovation or expansion, until the governing body of the municipality has certified that the renovation or expansion is completed; however, in the case of any public facility consisting of more than one building or structure, such remittances shall be made on a quarterly basis beginning with the first quarter in which any sales tax revenue is generated by transactions taking place at any building or structure within such public facility, whether or not construction of all or any portion, phase, building, or structure of such public facility has been completed.</p><p>D. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the pledging of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or any of its revenues, for the payment of any bonds. Any appropriation made pursuant to this section shall be made only from sales tax revenues derived from the public facility for which bonds may have been issued to pay the cost, in whole or in part, of such public facility.</p><p>1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">173</a>; 1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">105</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">819</a>; 1998, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">492</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">497</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">141</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">184</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">474</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">522</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">506</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">566</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">568</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">581</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">608</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">7</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">47</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">93</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">499</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">836</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">274</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">678</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">789</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">830</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">568</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">724</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">766</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">551</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">718</a>; 2018, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">25</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">329</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1230</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1275</a>.</p>',12),r=[o];function l(s,c,h,f,p,u){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const d=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{b as __pageData,d as default};
