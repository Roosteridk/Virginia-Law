To that end and for the purpose of establishing a single body of law applicable to all state and local government officers and employees on the subject of conflict of interests, the General Assembly enacts this State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act so that the standards of conduct for such officers and employees may be uniform throughout the Commonwealth.</p><p>This chapter shall supersede all general and special acts and charter provisions which purport to deal with matters covered by this chapter except that the provisions of §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-852</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2287/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2287</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2287.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2287.1</a>, and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2289</a> and ordinances adopted pursuant thereto shall remain in force and effect.
