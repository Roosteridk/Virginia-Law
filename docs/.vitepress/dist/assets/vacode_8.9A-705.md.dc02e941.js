If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this title takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this title takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this title within one year after this takes effect.

Subsection (c) (2) applies to a financing statement that, before this title takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former § 8.9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.9A-301</a> et seq.) of this title provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.</p><p>(f) Application of Part 5 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.9A-501</a> et seq.) of this title.
