Pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board, the parent of an eligible child or children who is married to a person not the parent of the child or children shall not be eligible for TANF if the parent&#39;s spouse&#39;s income, when deemed available to the family unit according to federal regulations, in and of itself, exceeds the state eligibility standard for such aid. However, eligibility for the child or children shall be considered by counting the income of such parent and child or children, and any portion of the parent&#39;s spouse&#39;s income that exceeds 150 percent of the federal poverty level for the spouse and parent. If the income of the parent&#39;s spouse that is deemed available does not, in and of itself, exceed the state eligibility standard for TANF, none of the spouse&#39;s income shall be counted as available to the family unit, and eligibility shall be determined considering only the income, if any, of the parent and the child or children. If the parent fails or refuses to cooperate with the Department&#39;s Division of Child Support Enforcement in the pursuit of child support, the income of the parent&#39;s current spouse shall be counted in accordance with Title IV-A federal regulations at 45 C.F.R. 233.20(a) (3) (xiv) in determining eligibility for TANF for the parent&#39;s child or children.</p><p>B.
