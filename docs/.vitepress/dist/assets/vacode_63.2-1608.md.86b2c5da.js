In ordering involuntary adult protective services, the court shall authorize only that intervention which it finds to be least restrictive of the adult&#39;s liberty and rights, while consistent with his welfare and safety. The basis for such finding shall be stated in the record by the court.</p><p>C. The adult shall not be required to pay for involuntary adult protective services, unless such payment is authorized by the court upon a showing that the person is financially able to pay.
