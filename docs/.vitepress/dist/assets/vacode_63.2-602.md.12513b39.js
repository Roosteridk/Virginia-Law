If paternity is not established after six months of receipt of TANF, the case shall be reviewed to determine the reason that paternity has not been established. If paternity has not been established due to the caretaker relative&#39;s noncooperation, the local department may suspend the entire grant or the adult portion of the grant, subject to Board regulations.</p><p>D.
