The person desiring to acquire title also shall place a notice, to appear for three consecutive issues, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the watercraft is located. The notice shall describe the watercraft, its location, and any identifying number or numbers. The notice shall state that if the watercraft is not claimed and removed within 30 days after the first day the notice was published, the person who has placed the notice shall apply to the Department for title to the watercraft.</p><p>E. At the end of the 30-day period, the person seeking to acquire the watercraft shall apply to the Department for title.

Upon receipt by the Department of all items required by subsection E, and after all fees and taxes due have been paid, the Department shall then issue title to the watercraft to the applicant.</p><p>G. All costs incurred in obtaining title to a watercraft under this section shall be borne by the applicant.</p><p>2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">787</a>.</p>',9),o=[r];function s(l,h,d,c,p,f){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const b=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
