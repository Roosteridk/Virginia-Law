If the landlord of a dwelling unit has actual knowledge of the existence of defective drywall in such dwelling unit that has not been remediated, the landlord shall provide to a prospective tenant a written disclosure that the property has defective drywall. Such disclosure shall be provided prior to the execution by the tenant of a written lease agreement or, in the case of an oral lease agreement, prior to occupancy by the tenant. For purposes of this section, &quot;defective drywall&quot; means all defective drywall as defined in § <a href="/vacode/36-156.1/">36-156.1</a>.</p><p>B. Any tenant who is not provided the disclosure required by subsection A may terminate the lease agreement at any time within 60 days of discovery of the existence of defective drywall by providing written notice to the landlord in accordance with the lease or as required by law. Such termination shall be effective as of (i) 15 days after the date of the mailing of the notice or (ii) the date through which rent has been paid, whichever is later. In no event, however, shall the effective date of the termination exceed one month from the date of mailing. Termination of the lease agreement shall be the exclusive remedy for the failure to comply with the disclosure provisions of this section, and shall not affect any rights or duties of the landlord or tenant arising under this chapter, other applicable law, or the rental agreement.</p><p>2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46</a>, § 55-248.12:2; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>.</p>',4),n=[a];function s(l,d,c,h,f,p){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const m=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{v as __pageData,m as default};
