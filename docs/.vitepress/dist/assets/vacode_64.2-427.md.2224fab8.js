A will may validly devise or bequeath property, including by the exercise of a power of appointment, to the trustee of a trust established or to be established (i) during the testator&#39;s lifetime by the testator, by the testator and some other person, or by some other person including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, although the settlor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance contracts or (ii) at the testator&#39;s death by the testator&#39;s devise or bequest to the trustee, if the trust is identified in the testator&#39;s will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument, other than a will, executed before, concurrently with, or after the execution of the testator&#39;s will or in another individual&#39;s will if that other individual has predeceased the testator, regardless of the existence, size, or character of the corpus of the trust. The devise or bequest is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or the testator&#39;s death.</p><p>B. Unless the testator&#39;s will provides otherwise, property devised or bequeathed to a trust described in subsection A is not held under a testamentary trust of the testator but it becomes a part of the trust to which it is devised or bequeathed, and shall be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument setting forth the terms of the trust, including any amendments thereto made before or after the testator&#39;s death.</p><p>C. Unless the testator&#39;s will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator&#39;s death causes the devise or bequest to lapse.</p><p>D. Unless at least one trustee of the trust is an individual resident of the Commonwealth or an entity authorized to do a trust business in the Commonwealth, at the time the devise or bequest is to be distributed to the trust, the testator&#39;s personal representative shall not make any distribution to the trust until each nonresident individual or entity files with the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the testator&#39;s will was admitted to probate, a consent in writing that service of process in any action against the trustee or any other notice with respect to administration of the trust in the trustee&#39;s charge may be by service upon a resident of the Commonwealth at such address as the trustee may appoint in the written instrument filed with the clerk. No further requirement shall be imposed upon any nonresident individual or entity as a condition to receiving the devise or bequest.</p><p>E. This section applies to a will of a testator who dies after June 30, 1999, and it shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this section among states enacting it.</p><p>1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">252</a>, § 64.1-73.1; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">614</a>.</p>',7),o=[i];function n(h,d,u,l,c,f){return e(),s("div",null,o)}const b=t(a,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
