When a report of the accounts of any personal representative and of the debts and demands against the decedent&#39;s estate has been filed in the office of a clerk of a court, whether under §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-550/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-550</a> and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-551/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-551</a> or in a civil action, the court, after six months from the qualification of the personal representative, may, on motion of the personal representative, or a successor or substitute personal representative, or on motion of a legatee or distributee of the decedent, enter an order for the creditors and all other persons interested in the estate of the decedent to show cause on the day named in the order against the payment and delivery of the estate of the decedent to his legatees or distributees. A copy of the order shall be published once a week for two successive weeks, in one or more newspapers, as the court directs; the costs of such publication shall be paid by the petitioner or applicant. On or after the day named in the order, the court may order the payment and delivery to the legatees or distributees of the whole or a part of the money and other estate not before distributed, with or without a refunding bond, as it prescribes. However, every legatee or distributee to whom any such payment or delivery is made, and his representatives, may, in a suit brought against him within five years after such payment or delivery is made, be adjudged to refund a due proportion of any claims enforceable against the decedent or his estate that have been finally allowed by the commissioner of accounts or the court, or that were not presented to the commissioner of accounts, and the costs of the recovery of such claim. In the event any claim becomes known to the fiduciary after the notice for debts and demands but prior to the entry of an order of distribution, the claimant, if the claim is disputed, shall be given notice in the form provided in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/64.2-550/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">64.2-550</a> and the order of distribution shall not be entered until after expiration of 10 days from the giving of such notice.
