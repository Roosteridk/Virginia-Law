The petitioner may not be required to pay a filing fee or other costs.</p><p>B. If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal of the Commonwealth may assess against an obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney&#39;s fees, other costs, and necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee&#39;s witnesses. The tribunal may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against the obligee or the support enforcement agency of either the initiating or the responding state or foreign country, except as provided by other law. Attorney&#39;s fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney&#39;s own name.
