Each covered institution that complies with the requirements of this article shall have the powers set forth in this article that are expressly included in the management agreement.</p><p>B. Each management agreement shall include:</p><ol><li><p>A copy of the governing board&#39;s resolution in support of a request for restructured operational authority;</p></li><li><p>The institution&#39;s express agreement to reimburse the Commonwealth for any additional costs that the Commonwealth incurs to provide health or other group insurance benefits to employees and undertake any risk management program that are attributable to the institution&#39;s exercise of restructured operational authority;</p></li><li><p>The institution&#39;s undergraduate Virginia student enrollment, financial aid requirements and capabilities, and tuition policy for undergraduate Virginia students; and</p></li><li><p>A statement of the Governor&#39;s power to void the management agreement pursuant to subsection E of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-1007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">23.1-1007</a>.</p></li></ol><p>C. There is a presumption that restructured operational authority is not included in the management agreement, and such authority shall only be granted to a covered institution if it is expressly included in the management agreement.

In the event of a conflict between any provision of Title 2.2 and any provision of the management agreement, the provisions of the management agreement control. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this article and an institution&#39;s enabling statutes, the enabling statutes control.</p><p>F.

A covered institution, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, and the members of its governing board are entitled to the same sovereign immunity to which they would be entitled if the institution were not governed by this article.</p><p>H. The Virginia Tort Claims Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-195.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-195.1</a> et seq.) and its limitations on recoveries remain applicable to covered institutions.</p><p>I. A management agreement with a public institution of higher education shall not grant restructured operational authority to the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service and Agricultural Experiment Station Division, the University of Virginia&#39;s College at Wise, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, or an affiliated entity of the institution unless the intent to grant such authority and the degree to which such authority is granted is expressly included in the management agreement.</p><p>J.
