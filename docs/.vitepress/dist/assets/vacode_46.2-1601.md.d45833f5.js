It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in business in the Commonwealth as an auto recycler, salvage pool, or vehicle removal operator without first acquiring a license issued by the Commissioner for each such business at each location. The fee for the first such license issued or renewed under this chapter shall be $100 per license year or part thereof. The fee for each additional license issued or renewed under this chapter for the same location shall be $25 per license year or part thereof. However, no fee shall be charged for supplemental locations of a business located within 500 yards of the licensed location.</p><p>B. No license shall be issued or renewed for any person unless (i) the licensed business contains at least 600 square feet of enclosed space, (ii) the licensed business is shown to be in compliance with all applicable zoning ordinances, and (iii) the applicant may (a) certify to the Commissioner that the licensed business is permitted under a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System individual or general permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality for discharges of storm water associated with industrial activity and provides the permit number(s) from such permit(s) or (b) certify to the Commissioner that the licensed business is otherwise exempt from such permitting requirements. Nothing in this section shall authorize any person to act as a motor vehicle dealer or salesperson without being licensed under Chapter 15 (§ <a href="/vacode/46.2-1500/">46.2-1500</a> et seq.) and meeting all requirements imposed by such chapter.</p><p>C. Licenses issued under this section shall be deemed not to have expired if the renewal application and required fees as set forth in subsection A are received by the Commissioner or postmarked not more than 30 days after the expiration date of such license. Whenever the renewal application is received by the Commissioner or postmarked not more than 30 days after the expiration date of such license, the license fees shall be 150 percent of the fees provided for in subsection A.</p><p>D. The Commissioner may offer an optional multiyear license for any license set forth in this section. When such option is offered and chosen by the licensee, all fees due at the time of licensing shall be multiplied by the number of years for which the license will be issued.</p><p>1988, c. 865, § 46.1-550.7:1; 1989, c. 727; 1990, c. 197; 1992, c. 148; 1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">53</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">664</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">33</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">177</a>; 2022, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">356</a>.</p>',6),n=[r];function o(l,c,h,f,d,p){return i(),s("div",null,n)}const g=e(t,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
