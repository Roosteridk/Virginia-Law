At the request of the property owner, after demolition or renovation of the derelict building, the real estate assessor shall reflect the fair market value of the demolition costs or the fair market value of the renovation improvements, and reflect such value in the real estate tax assessment records. The real estate tax on an amount equal to the costs of demolition or an amount equal to the increase in the fair market value of the renovations shall be abated for a period of not less than 15 years, and is transferable with the property. The abatement of taxes for demolition shall not apply if the structure demolished is a registered Virginia landmark or is determined by the Department of Historic Resources to contribute to the significance of a registered historic district. However, if the locality has an existing tax abatement program for less than 15 years, as of July 1, 2009, the locality may provide for a tax abatement period of not less than five years.</p></li><li><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the locality may proceed to make repairs and secure the building under § <a href="/vacode/15.2-906/">15.2-906</a>, or the locality may proceed to abate or remove a nuisance under § <a href="/vacode/15.2-900/">15.2-900</a>.
