Subject to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-286.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-286.1</a>, service of a process on a nonresident person outside the Commonwealth may be made by: (i) any person authorized to serve process in the jurisdiction where the party to be served is located; or (ii) any person 18 years of age or older who is not a party or otherwise interested in the subject matter of the controversy and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, such person need not be authorized by the circuit court to serve process which commences divorce or annulment actions. When the court can exercise jurisdiction over the nonresident pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-328.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-328.1</a>, such service shall have the same effect as personal service on the nonresident within Virginia.

The person so served shall be in default upon his failure to file a pleading in response to original process within 21 days after such service. If no responsive pleading is filed within the time allowed by law, the case may proceed without service of any additional pleadings, including the notice of the taking of depositions.</p><p>B.
