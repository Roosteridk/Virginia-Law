The road improvements plan shall be adopted as an amendment to the required comprehensive plan and shall be incorporated into the capital improvements program or, in the case of the counties where applicable, the six-year plan for secondary highway construction pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/33.2-331/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">33.2-331</a>.</p><p>The locality shall adopt the road improvements plan after holding a duly advertised public hearing. The public hearing notice shall identify the impact fee service area or areas to be designated, and shall include a summary of the needs assessment and the assumptions upon which the assessment is based, the proposed amount of the impact fee, and information as to how a copy of the complete study may be examined. A copy of the complete study shall be available for public inspection and copying at reasonable times prior to the public hearing.</p><p>The locality at a minimum shall include the following items in assessing road improvement needs and preparing a road improvements plan:</p><ol><li><p>An analysis of the existing capacity, current usage and existing commitments to future usage of existing roads, as indicated by (i) current and projected service levels, (ii) current valid building permits outstanding, and (iii) approved and pending site plans and subdivision plats. If the current usage and commitments exceed the existing capacity of the roads, the locality also shall determine the costs of improving the roads to meet the demand. The analysis shall include any off-site road improvements or cash payments for road improvements accepted by the locality and shall include a plan to fund the current usages and commitments that exceed the existing capacity of the roads.</p></li><li><p>The projected need for and costs of construction of new roads or improvement or expansion of existing roads attributable in whole or in part to projected new development. Road improvement needs shall be projected for the impact fee service area when fully developed in accord with the comprehensive plan and, if full development is projected to occur more than 20 years in the future, at the end of a 20-year period. The assumptions with regard to land uses, densities, intensities, and population upon which road improvement projections are based shall be presented.</p></li><li><p>The total number of new service units projected for the impact fee service area when fully developed and, if full development is projected to occur more than 20 years in the future, at the end of a 20-year period. A &quot;service unit&quot; is a standardized measure of traffic use or generation. The locality shall develop a table or method for attributing service units to various types of development and land use, including but not limited to residential, commercial and industrial uses. The table shall be based upon the ITE manual (published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) or locally conducted trip generation studies, and consistent with the traffic analysis standards adopted pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2222.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2222.1</a>.</p></li></ol><p>1989, c. 485, § 15.1-498.4; 1992, c. 465; 1997, c. 587; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">896</a>.</p>',6),r=[i];function s(d,l,p,c,h,m){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const v=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
