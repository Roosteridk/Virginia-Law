As used in this section, &quot;agricultural best management practice&quot; means a practice approved by the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board that will provide a significant improvement to water quality in the state&#39;s streams and rivers and the Chesapeake Bay and is consistent with other state and federal programs that address agricultural, nonpoint source pollution management.

Any eligible practice approved by the local Soil and Water Conservation District Board shall be completed within the taxable year in which the credit is claimed. After the practice installation has been completed, the local SWCD Board shall certify the practice as approved and completed, and eligible for credit. The applicant shall forward the certification to the Department of Taxation on forms provided by the Department. The credit shall be allowed only for expenditures made by the taxpayer from funds of his own sources.</p><ol start="2"><li>To the extent that a taxpayer participates in the Virginia Agricultural Best Management Practices Cost-Share Program, the taxpayer may claim the credit under subdivision A 2 for any remaining liability after such cost-share, but may not claim the credit under subdivision A 3 for any such remaining liability, subject to the other provisions of this section. For purposes of this subdivision, &quot;liability after such cost-share&quot; means the limitation of the tax credits to the total costs incurred by the taxpayer for agricultural best management practices reduced by any funding received by participation in the Virginia Agricultural Best Management Practices Cost-Share Program.</li></ol><p>C. 1. The aggregate amount of such credit claimed under subdivisions A 2 and 3 shall not exceed $75,000 or the total amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, whichever is less, in the year the project was completed, as certified by the Board.

A pass-through tax entity, such as a partnership, limited liability company or electing small business corporation (S corporation), may appoint a tax matters representative, who shall be a general partner, member-manager or shareholder, and register that representative with the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall be entitled to deal with the tax matters representative as representative of the taxpayers to whom credits have been allocated by the entity under this article with respect to those credits. In the event a pass-through tax entity allocates tax credits arising under this article to its partners, members or shareholders and the allocated credits shall be disallowed, in whole or in part, such that an assessment of additional tax against a taxpayer shall be made, the Tax Commissioner shall first make written demand for payment of any additional tax, together with interest and penalties, from the tax matters representative. In the event such payment demand is not satisfied, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed to collection against the taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18 (§ <a href="/vacode/58.1-1800/">58.1-1800</a> et seq.).</p><p>1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">629</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">440</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">352</a>; 2021, Sp.
