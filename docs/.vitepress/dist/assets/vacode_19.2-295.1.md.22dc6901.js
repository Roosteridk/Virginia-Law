At such proceeding, the Commonwealth may present any victim impact testimony pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/19.2-295.3/">19.2-295.3</a> and shall present the defendant&#39;s prior criminal history, including prior convictions and the punishments imposed, by certified, attested, or exemplified copies of the final order, including adult convictions and juvenile convictions and adjudications of delinquency. Prior convictions shall include convictions and adjudications of delinquency under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories. The Commonwealth shall provide to the defendant 14 days prior to trial notice of its intention to introduce copies of final orders evidencing the defendant&#39;s prior criminal history, including prior convictions and punishments imposed. Such notice shall include (i) the date of each prior conviction, (ii) the name and jurisdiction of the court where each prior conviction was had, (iii) each offense of which he was convicted, and (iv) the punishment imposed. Prior to commencement of the trial, the Commonwealth shall provide to the defendant photocopies of certified copies of the final orders that it intends to introduce at sentencing. After the Commonwealth has introduced in its case-in-chief of the sentencing phase such evidence of prior convictions or victim impact testimony, or both, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.</p><p>If the jury cannot agree on a punishment, the court shall fix punishment.</p><p>If the sentence imposed pursuant to this section is subsequently set aside or found invalid solely due to an error in the sentencing proceeding, the court shall impanel a different jury to ascertain punishment, unless the defendant, the attorney for the Commonwealth and the court agree, in the manner provided in § <a href="/vacode/19.2-257/">19.2-257</a>, that the court shall fix punishment.</p><p>1994, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">828</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">860</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">862</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">881</a>; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">567</a>; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">664</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">389</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">388</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">478</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">134</a>; 2020, Sp.
