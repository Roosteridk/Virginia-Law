Notwithstanding any provision of this article limiting eligibility for tax credits, an individual making a monetary donation or a donation of marketable securities to a neighborhood organization approved under this article shall be eligible for a credit against taxes imposed by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-320</a> as provided in this section.</p><p>B. Notwithstanding any provision of this article specifying the amount of a tax credit, a tax credit issued to an individual making a monetary donation or a donation of marketable securities to an approved project shall be equal to 65 percent of the value of such donation; however, tax credits (i) shall not be issued for any donation made in the taxable year with a value of less than $500 and (ii) shall be issued only for the first $125,000 in value of donations made by the individual during the taxable year. The maximum aggregate donations of $125,000 for the taxable year for which tax credits may be issued and the minimum required donation of $500 shall apply on an individual basis.</p><p>C. An individual shall be eligible for a tax credit under this section only to the extent that sufficient tax credits allocated to the neighborhood organization approved under this article are available. Notwithstanding that this section establishes a tax credit of 65 percent of the value of the qualified donation, an individual may by written agreement accept a lesser tax credit percentage from a neighborhood organization for any otherwise qualified donation he has made.</p><p>D. The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section, if such credit has been issued by the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Commissioner of Social Services, shall not exceed the tax imposed pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-320</a> for such taxable year. Any credit not usable for the taxable year may be carried over for credit against the individual&#39;s income taxes until the earlier of (i) the full amount of the credit is used or (ii) the expiration of the fifth taxable year after the taxable year in which the tax credit has been issued to such individual. If an individual that is subject to the tax limitation imposed pursuant to this subsection is allowed another credit pursuant to any other section of the Code of Virginia, or has a credit carryover from a preceding taxable year, such individual shall be considered to have first utilized any credit allowed that does not have a carryover provision, and then any credit that is carried forward from a preceding taxable year, prior to the utilization of any credit allowed pursuant to this section.</p><p>E. A tax credit shall be issued by the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Commissioner of Social Services to an individual only upon receipt of a certification made by a neighborhood organization to whom tax credits were allocated for an approved program pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-439.20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58.1-439.20</a>.</p><p>The certification shall identify the type and value of the donation received, the individual making the donation, and the tax credit percentage to be used in determining the amount of the tax credit. The certification shall also include any written agreement under which an individual accepts a tax credit of less than 65 percent for a donation.</p><p>2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">946</a>, § 63.1-325.2; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">292</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">300</a>; 2002, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">563</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">747</a>, § 63.2-2006; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">82</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">463</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">585</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">851</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">731</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">842</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">713</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">716</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">56</a>.</p>',9),o=[n];function l(s,d,h,c,f,g){return i(),a("div",null,o)}const v=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{p as __pageData,v as default};
