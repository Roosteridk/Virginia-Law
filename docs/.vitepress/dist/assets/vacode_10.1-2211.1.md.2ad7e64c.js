At the direction of the Director, the Comptroller of the Commonwealth is instructed and empowered to draw annual warrants upon the State Treasurer from any sums that may be provided in the general appropriation act, in favor of the treasurers of the Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (VASSAR) and the Revolutionary War memorial associations caring for cemeteries as set forth in subsection B. Such sums shall be expended by the associations for the routine maintenance of their respective Revolutionary War cemeteries and graves and for the graves of Revolutionary War soldiers and sailors not otherwise cared for in other cemeteries and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials, and monuments to the memory of such soldiers, sailors, and persons rendering service to the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. All such associations, through their proper officers, are required after July 1 of each year to submit to the Director a certified statement that the funds disbursed to the association or organization in the preceding fiscal year were or will be expended for the routine maintenance of cemeteries and graves specified in this section and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials, and monuments to the memory of such soldiers, sailors, and persons rendering service to the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. If a cemetery association fails to comply with any of the requirements of this section, such association shall be prohibited from receiving moneys allocated under this section for all subsequent fiscal years until the association fully complies with the requirements. No retroactive disbursement of funds for any preceding year shall be made. The Director shall deposit any appropriated funds that are not disbursed during the same fiscal year into the Revolutionary War Cemeteries and Graves Fund created pursuant to § 10.1-2211.1:1.</p><p>B. Allocation of appropriations made pursuant to this section shall be based on the number of graves, monuments, and markers as set forth opposite the cemetery name, or as documented by each association multiplied by the rate of $5 or the average actual cost of routine maintenance, whichever is greater, for each grave, monument, or marker in the care of a cemetery association. For the purposes of this section, the &quot;average actual cost of care&quot; shall be determined by the Department in a biennial survey of at least four properly maintained cemeteries, each located in a different geographical region of the Commonwealth.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>a</td><td>IN THE COUNTIES
