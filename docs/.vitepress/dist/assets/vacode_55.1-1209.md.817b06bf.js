Any information received by a landlord pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1203/">55.1-1203</a> shall remain a confidential tenant record and shall not be released to any person except in response to a subpoena.</p><p>C. A tenant may designate a third party to receive duplicate copies of a summons that has been issued pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/8.01-126/">8.01-126</a> and of written notices from the landlord relating to the tenancy. Where such a third party has been designated by the tenant, the landlord shall mail the duplicate copy of any summons issued pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/8.01-126/">8.01-126</a> or notice to the designated third party at the same time the summons or notice is mailed to or served upon the tenant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant standing to any third party designated by the tenant to challenge actions of the landlord in which notice was mailed pursuant to this subsection. The failure of the landlord to give notice to a third party designated by the tenant shall not affect the validity of any judgment entered against the tenant.</p><p>D. A landlord or managing agent may enter into an agreement with a third-party service provider to maintain tenant records in electronic form or other medium. In such case, the landlord and managing agent shall not be liable under this section in the event of a breach of the electronic data of such third-party service provider, except in the case of gross negligence or intentional act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a landlord or managing agent to indemnify such third-party service provider.</p><p>E. A tenant may request a copy of his tenant records in paper or electronic form. If the rental agreement so provides, a landlord may charge a tenant requesting more than one copy of his records the actual costs of preparing copies of such records. However, if the landlord makes available tenant records to each tenant by electronic portal, the tenant shall not be required to pay for access to such portal.</p><p>1985, c. 567, § 55-248.9:1; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">760</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">426</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">491</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">667</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">489</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">550</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">596</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">744</a>; 2018, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">221</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">388</a>.</p>',8),o=[r];function l(s,c,h,d,p,f){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const u=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
