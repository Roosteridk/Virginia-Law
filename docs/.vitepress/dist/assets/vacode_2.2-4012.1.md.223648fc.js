Upon the concurrence of the Governor, and after written notice to the applicable standing committees of the Senate of Virginia and the House of Delegates, and to the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules, the agency may submit a fast-track regulation without having previously published a Notice of Intended Regulatory Action. The fast-track regulation shall be published in the Virginia Register of Regulations and posted on the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall, along with an agency statement setting out the reasons for using the fast-track rulemaking process. Such regulations shall be subject to the requirements set out in §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4007.03</a>, <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.04/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4007.04</a>, and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4007.05/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-4007.05</a>, except that the time for receiving public comment need not exceed 30 days after (i) publication of the regulation in the Virginia Register of Regulations and (ii) a public comment forum opens on the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall. The time for preparation of the economic impact analysis shall not exceed 30 days. If an objection to the use of the fast-track process is received within the public comment period from 10 or more persons, any member of the applicable standing committee of either house of the General Assembly or of the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules, the agency shall (i) file notice of the objection with the Registrar of Regulations for publication in the Virginia Register, and (ii) proceed with the normal promulgation process set out in this article with the initial publication of the fast-track regulation serving as the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action. Otherwise, the regulation will become effective or shall be repealed as appropriate, 15 days after the close of the comment period, unless the regulation or repeal is withdrawn or a later effective date is specified by the agency.</p><p>2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">224</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">873</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">916</a>.</p>',3),n=[o];function s(l,c,h,g,p,f){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
