No hospital shall receive additional inspections until all other licensed hospitals in the Commonwealth have also been inspected, unless the additional inspections are (i) necessary to follow up on a preoperational inspection or one or more violations, (ii) required by a uniformly applied risk-based schedule established by the Department, (iii) necessary to investigate a complaint regarding the hospital, or (iv) otherwise deemed necessary by the Commissioner or his designee to protect the health and safety of the public.</p><p>Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, all hospitals licensed by the Department of Health or Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services that have been certified under the provisions of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act for hospital or psychiatric services or that have obtained accreditation from a national accrediting organization granted authority by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure compliance with Medicare conditions of participation pursuant to § 1865 of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395bb) may be subject to inspections so long as such certification or accreditation is maintained but only to the extent necessary to ensure the public health and safety.</p><p>Code 1950, § 32-300.1; 1979, c. 220; 1989, c. 618; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">813</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">840</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">320</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">465</a>.</p>',5),s=[o];function r(l,c,h,p,d,g){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,y as default};
