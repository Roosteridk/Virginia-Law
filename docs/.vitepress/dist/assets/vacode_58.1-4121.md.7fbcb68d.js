The Director may suspend, revoke, refuse to renew, or assess a civil penalty against the holder of a service permit in a sum not to exceed $10,000, after notice and a hearing. Such service permit may, however, be temporarily suspended by the Director without prior notice, pending any prosecution, hearing, or investigation, whether by a third party or by the Director. A service permit may be suspended, revoked, or refused renewal by the Director for one or more of the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>Failure to comply with, or violation of, any provision of this chapter or any regulation or condition of the Department;</p></li><li><p>Failure to disclose facts during the application process that indicate that such service permit should not have been issued;</p></li><li><p>Conviction of a felony under the laws of the Commonwealth or any other state or of the United States subsequent to issuance of a service permit;</p></li><li><p>Failure to file any return or report, keep any record, or pay any fees or other charges required by this chapter;</p></li><li><p>Any act of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or conduct prejudicial to public confidence in the integrity of gaming operations;</p></li><li><p>A material change, since issuance of the service permit, with respect to any matters required to be considered by the Director under this chapter; or</p></li><li><p>Other factors established by Department regulation.</p></li></ol><p>B.
