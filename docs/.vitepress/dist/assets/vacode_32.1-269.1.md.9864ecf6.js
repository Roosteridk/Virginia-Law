A death certificate that is amended under this section shall be marked &quot;amended,&quot; and the date of amendment and a summary description of the evidence submitted in support of the amendment shall be endorsed on or made a part of the death certificate. The Board shall prescribe by regulation the conditions under which omissions or errors on death certificates may be corrected.</p><p>C. The State Registrar, upon receipt of an affidavit and supporting evidence testifying to corrected information on a death certificate within 45 days of the filing of a death certificate, shall amend such death certificate to reflect the new information and evidence.</p><p>D. The State Registrar, upon receipt of an affidavit and supporting evidence testifying to corrected information on a death certificate more than 45 days after the filing of a death certificate, including the correct spelling of the name of the deceased, the deceased&#39;s parent or spouse, or the informant; the sex, age, race, date of birth, place of birth, citizenship, social security number, education, occupation or kind or type of business, military status, or date of death of the deceased; the place of residence of the deceased, if located within the Commonwealth; the name of the institution; the county, city, or town where the death occurred; or the street or place where the death occurred, shall amend such death certificate to reflect the new information and evidence.</p><p>E.

The clerk shall submit such petition and any evidence received with the petition to the judge for entry of an order without the necessity of a hearing, unless the judge decides a hearing is necessary. The State Registrar or his authorized representative may appear and testify in such proceeding. The clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the court&#39;s order to the State Registrar, who shall amend such death certificate in accordance with the order.</p><p>2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">496</a>; 2017, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">284</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">285</a>; 2022, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">116</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">117</a>.</p>',8),n=[o];function c(h,d,s,f,u,l){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const g=e(r,[["render",c]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
