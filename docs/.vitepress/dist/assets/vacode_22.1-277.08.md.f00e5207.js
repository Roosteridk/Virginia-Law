School boards shall expel from school attendance any student whom such school board has determined, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article, to have brought a controlled substance, imitation controlled substance, or marijuana as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-247</a> onto school property or to a school-sponsored activity. A school administrator, pursuant to school board policy, or a school board may, however, determine, based on the facts of a particular situation, that special circumstances exist and no disciplinary action or another disciplinary action or another term of expulsion is appropriate. A school board may, by regulation, authorize the division superintendent or his designee to conduct a preliminary review of such cases to determine whether a disciplinary action other than expulsion is appropriate. Such regulations shall ensure that, if a determination is made that another disciplinary action is appropriate, any such subsequent disciplinary action is to be taken in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a student&#39;s expulsion regardless of the facts of the particular situation.</p><p>B. Each school board shall revise its standards of student conduct to incorporate the requirements of this section no later than three months after the date on which this act becomes effective.</p><p>1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">655</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">706</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">732</a>, § 22.1-277.01:1; 2001, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">688</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">820</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">384</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">410</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">109</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">312</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">577</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">674</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">719</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">765</a>.</p>',4),n=[o];function s(l,c,h,f,g,p){return r(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
