However, except as otherwise provided in subsection J of § <a href="/vacode/19.2-305.1/">19.2-305.1</a>, the Commonwealth shall not institute any proceedings in connection with its right of subrogation under this section within one year from the date of commission of the crime, unless any claimant or victim&#39;s right or action shall have been previously terminated.
