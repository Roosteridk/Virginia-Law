Insurance plans provided under this article and all proceeds from such plans are subject to the same provisions regarding exemption from levy, garnishment, and other legal process as is provided to Virginia Retirement System plans under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-510</a>, provided, however, that (i) permitted assignments shall be made through completion of forms provided by the covered institution or its vendor and (ii) for insurance plans established by a covered institution, the covered institution shall exercise the authority granted to the Board of the Virginia Retirement System in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-510/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-510</a>.</p><p>B. Each covered institution (i) shall purchase or make available group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans covering in whole or in part those of its participating covered employees eligible to participate in the Virginia Retirement System and (ii) may purchase or make available such additional insurance plans covering its participating covered employees as it deems appropriate. Participating covered employees shall not be required to present evidence of insurability satisfactory to an insurance company for basic group life insurance coverage. Each covered institution shall offer all salaried participating covered employees basic group life insurance at a level of coverage determined by the institution&#39;s governing board. A covered institution may require participating covered employees to pay all or a portion of the cost of the insurance coverage offered pursuant to this subsection, which may be collected through a payroll deduction program. If the institution&#39;s governing board so elects, and subject to the execution of such participation agreements as the Virginia Retirement System may require, the covered institution&#39;s participating covered employees may be covered by the Virginia Retirement System&#39;s group insurance programs established pursuant to Chapter 5 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/51.1-500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">51.1-500</a> et seq.) of Title 51.1 with the same terms, costs, conditions, and benefits as other state employees.</p><p>C. For those of its participating covered employees eligible to participate in the Virginia Retirement System, a covered institution shall (i) purchase disability insurance; (ii) subject to the execution of such participation agreements as may be necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the Commonwealth, continue to participate in the disability insurance program established for state agencies; (iii) establish a self-insured disability insurance program; or (iv) perform any combination of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii). A covered institution may require participating covered employees to pay all or a portion of the cost of the insurance coverage offered pursuant to clause (i), (iii), or (iv), which may be collected through a payroll deduction program. However, no such covered institution shall be required to contribute to the program established for state agencies on behalf of participating covered employees who do not participate in that program.</p><p>D. If a covered institution&#39;s governing board so elects, and subject to the execution of such participation agreements as may be necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the Commonwealth, each such institution or its participating covered employees, or both, may participate in any future insurance programs established for state employees with the same terms, conditions, and benefits as other state employees.</p><p>2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">933</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">945</a>, § 23-38.119; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">588</a>.</p>',6),n=[o];function s(c,p,l,h,d,u){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const v=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
