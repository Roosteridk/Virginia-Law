To enhance the accessibility and affordability of higher education for all citizens of the Commonwealth, and assist families and individuals to save for qualified disability expenses, the Virginia College Savings Plan is established as a body politic and corporate and an independent agency of the Commonwealth.</p><p>B. Moneys of the Plan that are contributions to savings trust accounts made pursuant to this chapter, except as otherwise authorized or provided in this chapter, shall be deposited as soon as practicable in a separate account or separate accounts in banks or trust companies organized under the laws of the Commonwealth, national banking associations, federal home loan banks, or, to the extent permitted by law, savings institutions organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States. The savings program moneys in such accounts shall be paid out on checks, drafts payable on demand, electronic wire transfers, or other means authorized by officers or employees of the Plan.</p><p>C. All other moneys of the Plan, including payments received pursuant to prepaid tuition contracts, bequests, endowments, grants from the United States government or its agencies or instrumentalities, and any other available public or private sources of funds shall be first deposited in the state treasury in a special nonreverting fund (the Fund). Such moneys shall then be deposited as soon as practicable in a separate account or separate accounts in banks or trust companies organized under the laws of the Commonwealth, national banking associations, federal home loan banks, or, to the extent permitted by law, savings institutions organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States. Benefits relating to prepaid tuition contracts and Plan operating expenses shall be paid from the Fund. Any moneys remaining in the Fund at the end of a biennium shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Interest and income earned from the investment of such funds shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it.</p><p>D. The Plan may maintain an independent disbursement system for the disbursement of prepaid tuition contract benefits and, in connection with such system, open and maintain a separate account or separate accounts in banks or trust companies organized under the laws of the Commonwealth, national banking associations, federal home loan banks, or, to the extent permitted by law, savings institutions organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States. Such independent disbursement system and any related procedures shall be subject to review and approval by the State Comptroller. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve the Plan of its duty to provide prepaid tuition contract benefit transactions to the Commonwealth&#39;s system of general accounting maintained by the State Comptroller pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/2.2-802/">2.2-802</a>.</p><p>E. The Plan shall be administered by an 11-member board that consists of (i) the director of the Council or his designee, the Chancellor of the Virginia Community College System or his designee, the State Treasurer or his designee, and the State Comptroller or his designee, all of whom shall serve ex officio with voting privileges, and (ii) seven nonlegislative citizen members, four of whom shall be appointed by the Governor, one of whom shall be appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, two of whom shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and all of whom shall have significant experience in finance, accounting, law, investment management, higher education, or disability advocacy. In addition, at least one of the nonlegislative citizen members shall have expertise in the management and administration of private defined contribution retirement plans.</p><p>F. Members appointed to the board shall serve terms of four years. Vacancies occurring other than by expiration of a term shall be filled for the unexpired term. No member appointed to the board shall serve more than two consecutive four-year terms; however, a member appointed to serve an unexpired term is eligible to serve two consecutive four-year terms immediately succeeding such unexpired term.</p><p>G. Ex officio members of the board shall serve terms coincident with their terms of office.</p><p>H. Members of the board shall receive no compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.</p><p>I. The board shall elect from its membership a chairman and a vice-chairman annually.</p><p>J. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum.</p><p>1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">661</a>, § 23-38.76; 1997, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">785</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">861</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">485</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">518</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">382</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">400</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">827</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">845</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">586</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">649</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">23</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">687</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">227</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">311</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">588</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">803</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">804</a>; 2021, Sp.
