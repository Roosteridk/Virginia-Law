However, for any entity with gross annual revenue of at least $1 million in the previous year, the Department may require that the entity provide a financial audit performed by an independent certified public accountant. If the Department specifically requires an entity with gross annual revenue of at least $1 million in the previous year to provide a financial audit performed by an independent certified public accountant, then the entity shall provide such audit in order to qualify for the exemption under this section, which audit shall be in lieu of the financial review; and</p></li><li><p>If the entity filed a federal 990 or 990 EZ tax form, or the successor forms to such forms, with the Internal Revenue Service, then it must provide a copy of such form to the Department of Taxation; and</p></li><li><p>If the entity did not file a federal 990 or 990 EZ tax form, or the successor forms to such forms, with the Internal Revenue Service, then the entity must provide the following information:</p></li></ol><p>a.

On and after July 1, 2004, in addition to the criteria set forth in subsection D, the Department of Taxation shall ask each entity for the total taxable purchases made in the preceding year, unless such records are not available through no fault of the entity. If the records are not available through no fault of the entity, then the entity must provide such information to the Department the following year. No information provided pursuant to this subsection (except the failure to provide available information) shall be a basis for the Department of Taxation to refuse to exempt an entity.</p><p>F. Any entity that is determined under subsections C, D, and E by the Department of Taxation to be exempt from paying sales and use tax shall also be exempt from collecting sales and use tax, at its election, if (i) the entity is within the same class of organization of any entity that was exempt from collecting sales and use tax on June 30, 2003, or (ii) the entity is organized exclusively to foster, sponsor, and promote physical education, athletic programs, and contests for youths in the Commonwealth.</p><p>G. The duration of each exemption granted by the Department of Taxation shall be no less than five years and no greater than seven years. During the period of such exemption, the failure of an exempt entity to maintain compliance with the applicable criteria set forth in subsection D shall constitute grounds for revocation of the exemption by the Department. At the end of the period of such exemption, to maintain or renew the exemption, each entity must provide the Department of Taxation the same information as required upon initial exemption and meet the same criteria.</p><p>H. For purposes of this section, the Department of Taxation and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall be allowed to share information when necessary to supplement the information required.</p><p>2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">757</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">758</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">515</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">536</a>; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">42</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">89</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">698</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">704</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">709</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">106</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">526</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">487</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20</a>.</p>',16),r=[o];function s(l,h,f,c,p,u){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const g=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
