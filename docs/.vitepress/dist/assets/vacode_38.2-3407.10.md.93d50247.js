However, such term does not include an arrangement between a carrier and providers in which any provider may participate solely on the basis of the provider&#39;s contracting with the carrier to provide services at a discounted fee-for-service rate.</p><p>B. Any such carrier that offers a provider panel shall establish and use it in accordance with the following requirements:</p><ol><li><p>Notice of the development of a provider panel in the Commonwealth or local service area shall be filed with the Department of Health Professions.</p></li><li><p>Carriers shall provide a provider application and the relevant terms and conditions to a provider upon request.</p></li></ol><p>C.

A carrier may not deny an application for participation or terminate participation on its provider panel on the basis of gender, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or national origin.</p><p>F. 1. For a period of at least 90 days from the date of the notice of a provider&#39;s termination from the carrier&#39;s provider panel, except when a provider is terminated for cause, the provider shall be permitted by the carrier to render health care services to any of the carrier&#39;s enrollees who:</p><p>a. Were in an active course of treatment from the provider prior to the notice of termination; and</p><p>b.

Such treatment shall, at the enrollee&#39;s option, continue through the provision of postpartum care directly related to the delivery.</p></li><li><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1, any provider shall be permitted by the carrier to continue rendering health services to any enrollee who is determined to be terminally ill (as defined under § 1861 (dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) at the time of a provider&#39;s termination of participation, except when a provider is terminated for cause.

A carrier shall provide to a purchaser upon enrollment and make available to existing enrollees at least once a year a list of members in its provider panel, which list shall also indicate those providers who are not currently accepting new patients.

No contract between a carrier and a provider may require that the provider indemnify the carrier for the carrier&#39;s negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of contract, if any.</p><p>I.

Carriers shall provide to their group policyholders written notice of any benefit reductions during the contract period at least 60 days before such benefit reductions become effective. Group policyholders shall, in turn, provide to their enrollees written notice of any benefit reductions during the contract period at least 30 days before such benefit reductions become effective. Such notice shall be provided to the group policyholder as a separate and distinct notification, and may not be combined with any other notification or marketing materials.</p><p>N. No contract between a provider and a carrier shall include provisions that require a health care provider or health care provider group to deny covered services that such provider or group knows to be medically necessary and appropriate that are provided with respect to a specific enrollee or group of enrollees with similar medical conditions.</p><p>O. If a provider panel contract between a provider and a carrier, or other entity that provides hospital, physician or other health care services to a carrier, includes provisions that require a provider, as a condition of participating in one of the carrier&#39;s or other entity&#39;s provider panels, to participate in any other provider panel owned or operated by that carrier or other entity, the contract shall contain a provision permitting the provider to refuse participation in one or more such other provider panels at the time the contract is executed. If a provider contracts with a carrier or other entity that subsequently contracts with one or more unaffiliated carriers to include such provider in the provider panels of such unaffiliated carriers, and which permits an unaffiliated carrier to impose participation terms with respect to such provider that differ materially in reimbursement rates or in managed care procedures, such as conducting economic profiling or requiring a patient to obtain primary care physician referral to a specialist, from the terms agreed to by the provider in the original contract, the provider panel contract shall contain a provision permitting the provider to refuse participation with any such unaffiliated carrier. Utilization review pursuant to Article 1.2 (§ <a href="/vacode/32.1-137.7/">32.1-137.7</a> et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 32.1 shall not constitute a materially different managed care procedure. This subsection shall apply to provider panels utilized by health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;preferred provider organization&quot; means a carrier that offers preferred provider contracts or policies as defined in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-3407/">38.2-3407</a> or preferred provider subscription contracts as defined in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-4209/">38.2-4209</a>. The status of a physician as a member of or as being eligible for other existing or new provider panels shall not be adversely affected by the exercise of such right to refuse participation. This subsection shall not apply to the Medallion II and children&#39;s health insurance plan administered by or pursuant to contract with the Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p><p>P. A carrier that rents or leases its provider panel to unaffiliated carriers shall make available, upon request, to its providers a list of unaffiliated carriers that rent or lease its provider panel. Such list if available in electronic format shall be updated monthly. The provider shall be given the means to request and receive a printed copy of such list.</p><p>Q. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies arising out of this section.</p><p>R.
