The governing body of any city or county employing a sealer may provide for the technical and reporting procedures to be followed, and the report and record forms and marks of approval and rejection to be used by such sealer within such city or county, unless the Board, after a hearing and with notice to the governing body of the city or county involved, finds that such procedures and forms are inadequate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p><p>B.
