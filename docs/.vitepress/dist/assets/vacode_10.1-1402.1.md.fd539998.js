No fees shall be charged for minor modifications or minor amendments to such permits. For purposes of this subdivision, &quot;minor permit modifications&quot; or &quot;minor amendments&quot; means specific types of changes, defined by the Board, that are made to keep the permit current with routine changes to the facility or its operation and that do not require extensive review. A minor permit modification or amendment does not substantially alter permit conditions, increase the size of the operation, or reduce the capacity of the facility to protect human health or the environment.</p></li><li><p>When promulgating regulations establishing permit fees, the Board shall take into account the permit fees charged in neighboring states and the importance of not placing existing or prospective industries in the Commonwealth at a competitive disadvantage.</p></li><li><p>On January 1, 1993, and January 1 of every even-numbered year thereafter, the Board shall evaluate the implementation of the permit fee program and provide this evaluation in writing to the Senate Committees on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Finance; and the House Committees on Appropriations, Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources, and Finance. This evaluation shall include a report on the total fees collected, the amount of general funds allocated to the Department, the Department&#39;s use of the fees and the general funds, the number of permit applications received, the number of permits issued, the progress in eliminating permit backlogs, and the timeliness of permit processing.</p></li><li><p>Fees collected pursuant to subdivisions 15a, 15b or 16 of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1402/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-1402</a> shall not supplant or reduce in any way the general fund appropriation to the Board.</p></li><li><p>These permit fees shall be collected in order to recover a portion of the agency&#39;s costs associated with (i) the processing of an application to issue, reissue, amend or modify permits, which the Board has authority to issue for the purpose of more efficiently and expeditiously processing and maintaining permits and (ii) the inspections necessary to assure the compliance of large quantity generators of hazardous waste.
