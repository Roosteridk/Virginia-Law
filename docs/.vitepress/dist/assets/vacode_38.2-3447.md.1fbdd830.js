If the proposed area rate factors set forth in a rate filing for individual or small group health insurance coverage by a health carrier for a rating area exceed by more than 15 percent the weighted average of the proposed area rate factors among all rating areas in which the health carrier offers health benefit plans in that market, then:</p><ol><li>The health carrier&#39;s rate filing shall include in a publicly available and unredacted form:</li></ol><p>a.

This definition shall not preclude a health carrier from calculating area rate factors for rates for the individual market, based on the cost and care delivery practices associated with the providers expected to be utilized by covered persons that reside in a given rating area, while calculating area rate factors for rates for the small group market, based on those providers that are expected to be utilized by individuals employed by small employers that are located in the rating area without regard to where the covered persons reside.</p><p>&quot;Provider&quot; means a health care provider, as defined in § <a href="/vacode/38.2-3438/">38.2-3438</a>, that is affiliated or in-network with a health carrier.</p><p>&quot;Weighted average,&quot; when referring to area rate factors, means the mean of the area rate factors when weighted based on the projected number of covered persons distributed by rating area.</p><p>2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">751</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">439</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">440</a>.</p>',22),n=[o];function s(l,h,c,d,p,f){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
