Conducting marketing activities on behalf of the landlord pursuant to the brokerage agreement with the landlord. In so doing, the licensee shall seek a tenant at the rent and terms agreed in the brokerage agreement or at a rent and terms acceptable to the landlord; however, the licensee shall not be obligated to seek additional offers to lease the property while the property is subject to a lease or a letter of intent to lease under which the tenant has not yet taken possession, unless agreed as part of the brokerage agreement, or unless the lease or the letter of intent to lease so provides;</p><p>b. Assisting the landlord in drafting and negotiating leases and letters of intent to lease, and presenting in a timely manner all written leasing offers or counteroffers to and from the landlord and tenant pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/54.1-2101.1/">54.1-2101.1</a>, even when the property is already subject to a lease or a letter of intent to lease; and</p><p>c.

Licensees shall treat all prospective tenants honestly and shall not knowingly give them false information. A licensee engaged by a landlord shall disclose to prospective tenants all material adverse facts pertaining to the physical condition of the property which are actually known by the licensee. If a licensee has actual knowledge of the existence of any pipe, pipe or plumbing fitting, fixture, solder, or flux that does not meet the federal Safe Drinking Water Act definition of &quot;lead free&quot; pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300g-6 in a residential property, the licensee shall disclose the same to the prospective tenant. As used in this section, the term &quot;physical condition of the property&quot; shall refer to the physical condition of the land and any improvements thereon, and shall not refer to: (i) matters outside the boundaries of the land or relating to adjacent or other properties in proximity thereto, (ii) matters relating to governmental land use regulations, and (iii) matters relating to highways or public streets. Such disclosure shall be made in writing. No cause of action shall arise against any licensee for revealing information as required by this article or applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the right of a prospective tenant to inspect the physical condition of the property.</p><p>C. A licensee engaged by a landlord in a real estate transaction may, unless prohibited by law or the brokerage agreement, provide assistance to a tenant, or potential tenant, by performing ministerial acts. Performing such ministerial acts that are not inconsistent with subsection A shall not be construed to violate the licensee&#39;s brokerage relationship with the landlord unless expressly prohibited by the terms of the brokerage agreement, nor shall performing such ministerial acts be construed to form a brokerage relationship with such tenant or potential tenant.</p><p>D. A licensee engaged by a landlord does not breach any duty or obligation owed to the landlord by showing alternative properties to prospective tenants, whether as clients or customers, or by representing other landlords who have other properties for lease.</p><p>E. Licensees in residential real estate transactions shall disclose brokerage relationships pursuant to the provisions of this article.</p><p>1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">741</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">813</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">627</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">741</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">461</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">750</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">334</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">520</a>.</p>',12),o=[i];function l(s,h,c,p,d,g){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const u=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{b as __pageData,u as default};
