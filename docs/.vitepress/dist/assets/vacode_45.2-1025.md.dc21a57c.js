Upon receipt of such application, the Director shall cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate. Such investigation shall, at the request of the applicant or the person having an interest that is or could be adversely affected, include a public formal hearing to enable the applicant or such person to present information relating to the issuance and continuance of such notice or order or the modification, vacation, or termination thereof.
