If a claim has been made against the fund, and the Board has reason to believe there may be additional claims against the fund from other transactions involving the same regulant, the Board may withhold any payments from the fund involving such regulant for a period of not more than one year from the date on which the claimant is approved by the Board for an award from the fund. After this one-year period, if the aggregate of claims against the regulant exceeds the above limitations, said amount shall be prorated by the Board among the claimants and paid from the fund in proportion to the amounts of their awards remaining unpaid.</p><p>The amount of damages awarded by the Board shall be limited to actual, compensatory damages and shall not include attorney&#39;s fees for representation before the Board.</p><p>1991, c. 555; 1992, c. 223; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">671</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">141</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">579</a>.</p>',7),i=[n];function l(s,h,d,c,f,p){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const g=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
