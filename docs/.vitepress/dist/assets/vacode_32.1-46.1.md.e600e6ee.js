In promulgating such regulations, the Board shall consider the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and may consider such other materials relating to lead poisoning prevention, testing, and treatment as it deems appropriate. The Board may also establish procedures governing how health care providers and laboratories report results to the Department of Health.</p><p>The Commissioner may authorize linkages between secure electronic data systems maintained by the Department of Health containing blood-lead level records and the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS) operated pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-46.01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">32.1-46.01</a>. The Commissioner may authorize health care providers authorized to view VIIS to view blood-lead level records of individuals to whom the providers are providing health care services. The records may be made available until the child reaches seven years of age, after which the records shall not be made available through a linkage to VIIS. Such linkages shall be subject to all applicable state and federal privacy laws and regulations.</p><p>2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">907</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">463</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">691</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">147</a>.</p>',5),l=[i];function n(s,d,h,c,p,f){return a(),o("div",null,l)}const b=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{v as __pageData,b as default};
