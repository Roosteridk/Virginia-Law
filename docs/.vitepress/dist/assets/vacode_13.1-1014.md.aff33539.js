A limited liability company may amend its articles of organization at any time to add or change a provision that is required or permitted in the articles, or to delete a provision not required in the articles. An amendment to the articles of organization may delete the name and address of the registered agent or registered office, or the address of the principal office, if a statement of change described in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-1016</a> or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-1018.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-1018.1</a>, as the case may be, is on file with the Commission.</p><p>B. For an amendment to the articles of organization of a limited liability company to be adopted, the amendment shall be approved by that number or percentage of members required to amend an operating agreement, unless the articles of organization or a written operating agreement otherwise provide, provided that if the limited liability company has been formed without any members and no members have been admitted, an amendment may be adopted by a majority of the persons named as a manager in the articles of organization or, if there are no members or managers, by a majority of the organizers of the limited liability company.</p><p>C. To amend its articles of organization, a limited liability company shall file with the Commission articles of amendment setting forth:</p><ol><li><p>The name of the limited liability company;</p></li><li><p>The text of each amendment adopted;</p></li><li><p>The date of each amendment&#39;s adoption; and</p></li><li><p>A statement that the amendment was adopted by a vote of the members, by the managers or by the organizers in accordance with this chapter, as the case may be.</p></li></ol><p>If the Commission finds that the articles of amendment comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of amendment.</p><p>D. An amendment to articles of organization does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the limited liability company, a proceeding to which the limited liability company is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than members of the limited liability company. An amendment changing a limited liability company&#39;s name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the limited liability company in its former name.</p><p>E. A member of a limited liability company does not have a vested property right resulting from any provision of the articles of organization.</p><p>1991, c. 168; 1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">190</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">548</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">255</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">748</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">912</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">108</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">17</a>.</p>',9),n=[o];function l(s,m,d,h,c,f){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
