No covered institution is exempt from the State Grievance Procedure (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-3000</a> et seq.), which shall continue to apply to all eligible nonfaculty covered employees of a covered institution. The governing board of each covered institution shall adopt policies that encourage the resolution of employment-related problems and complaints of its nonfaculty covered employees. Such policies shall provide that nonfaculty covered employees of the institution may discuss their concerns with their immediate supervisors and management freely and without retaliation. To the extent that such concerns cannot be resolved informally, the State Grievance Procedure (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-3000</a> et seq.) shall apply (i) to the covered institution&#39;s nonfaculty participating covered employees to the same extent that it applied to the same classifications of nonfaculty employees prior to the institution&#39;s effective date of the initial management agreement and (ii) to the covered institution&#39;s salaried nonfaculty covered employees who have elected pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-1022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">23.1-1022</a> to continue to participate in the state human resources program set forth in Chapters 28 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-2800</a> et seq.) and 29 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-2900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2.2-2900</a> et seq.) of Title 2.2.</p><p>B.
