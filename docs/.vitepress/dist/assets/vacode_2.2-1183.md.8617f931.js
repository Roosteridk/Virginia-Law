Any executive branch agency or institution entering the design phase for the construction of a new building greater than 5,000 gross square feet in size, or the renovation of a building where the cost of the renovation exceeds 50 percent of the value of the building, shall ensure that such building:</p><ol><li><p>Is designed, constructed, verified, and operated to comply with the high performance building certification program and VEES;</p></li><li><p>Has sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure. However, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to buildings located in the right-of-way of the Interstate System as that term is defined in § <a href="/vacode/33.2-100/">33.2-100</a>; and</p></li><li><p>Has features that permit the agency or institution to track the building&#39;s energy efficiency and associated carbon emissions, including metering of all electricity, gas, water, and other utilities.</p></li></ol><p>B.

Such exemption shall be made in writing and shall explain the basis for granting such exemption. If the Director cites cost as a factor in granting an exemption, the Director shall include a comparison of the cost the agency or institution will incur over the next 20 years if the agency does not comply with the standards required by subsection A versus the costs to the agency or institution if the agency or institution were to comply with such standards.</p><p>D. Each agency or institution shall submit an annual report to the Governor by January 1 of each year detailing the energy-efficiency and associated carbon emissions metrics for each building built or renovated in accordance with the design and construction standards required by subsection A and completed during the prior fiscal year.</p><p>2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">680</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">793</a>; 2021, Sp.
