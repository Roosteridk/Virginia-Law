Property included under this category consists of:</li></ol><p>a. Property over which the decedent, alone, immediately before death, held a presently exercisable general power of appointment.

Any transfer in which the decedent created a power over income or property, exercisable by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any other person, or exercisable by a non-adverse party, to or for the benefit of the decedent, creditors of the decedent, the decedent&#39;s estate, or creditors of the decedent&#39;s estate. The amount included with respect to a power over property is the value of the property subject to the power, and the amount included with respect to a power over income is the value of the property that produces or produced the income, to the extent the power in either case was exercisable at the decedent&#39;s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent&#39;s surviving spouse or to the extent the property passed at the decedent&#39;s death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent&#39;s estate or surviving spouse.

The amount included is the value of the property that would have been included under those subdivisions if the property were valued at the time the right, interest, or power terminated, and is included only to the extent the property passed upon termination to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent or the decedent&#39;s estate, spouse, or surviving spouse. As used in this subdivision, &quot;termination,&quot; with respect to a right or interest in property, occurs when the right or interest terminated by the terms of the governing instrument or the decedent transferred or relinquished the right or interest, and, with respect to a power over property, occurs when the power terminated by exercise, release, lapse, default, or otherwise, but, with respect to a power described in subdivision 1 a, &quot;termination&quot; occurs when the power terminated by exercise or release, but not otherwise.</p><p>b. Any transfer of or relating to an insurance policy on the life of the decedent if the proceeds would have been included in the augmented estate under subdivision 1 d had the transfer not occurred. The amount included is the value of the insurance proceeds to the extent the proceeds were payable at the decedent&#39;s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent&#39;s estate or surviving spouse.</p><p>c.
