If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to which this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary that does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to a share of the net income the fiduciary received after the decedent&#39;s death, an income interest&#39;s other terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.</p><p>B.
