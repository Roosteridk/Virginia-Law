A school board shall provide pupil personnel and support services in compliance with § <a href="/vacode/22.1-253.13:2/">22.1-253.13:2</a>. A school board may employ school nurses, physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. No such personnel shall be employed unless they meet such standards as may be determined by the Board. Subject to the approval of the appropriate local governing body, a local health department may provide personnel for health services for the school division.</p><p>B. In implementing subsection P of § <a href="/vacode/22.1-253.13:2/">22.1-253.13:2</a>, relating to providing support services that are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective operation and maintenance of its public schools, each school board may strive to employ, or contract with local health departments for, nursing services consistent with a ratio of at least one nurse per 1,000 students. In those school divisions in which there are more than 1,000 students in average daily membership in school buildings, this section shall not be construed to encourage the employment of more than one nurse per school building. Further, this section shall not be construed to mandate the aspired-to ratios.</p><p>C. The Board shall monitor the progress in achieving the ratio set forth in subsection B and any subsequent increase in prevailing statewide costs, and the mechanism for funding health services, pursuant to subsection P of § <a href="/vacode/22.1-253.13:2/">22.1-253.13:2</a> and the appropriation act. The Board shall also determine how school health funds are used and school health services are delivered in each locality.</p><p>D. With the exception of school administrative personnel and persons employed by school boards who have the specific duty to deliver health-related services, no licensed instructional employee, instructional aide, or clerical employee shall be disciplined, placed on probation, or dismissed on the basis of such employee&#39;s refusal to (i) perform nonemergency health-related services for students or (ii) obtain training in the administration of insulin and glucagon. However, instructional aides and clerical employees may not refuse to dispense oral medications.</p><p>For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;health-related services&quot; means those activities that, when performed in a health care facility, must be delivered by or under the supervision of a licensed or certified professional.</p><p>E. Each school board shall ensure that in school buildings with an instructional and administrative staff of 10 or more (i) at least three employees have current certification or training in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator and (ii) if one or more students diagnosed as having diabetes attend such school, at least two employees have been trained in the administration of insulin and glucagon. In school buildings with an instructional and administrative staff of fewer than 10, school boards shall ensure that (a) at least two employees have current certification or training in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator and (b) if one or more students diagnosed as having diabetes attend such school, at least one employee has been trained in the administration of insulin and glucagon. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;employee&quot; includes any person employed by a local health department who is assigned to the public school pursuant to an agreement between the local health department and the school board. When a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, physician, or physician assistant is present, no employee who is not a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, physician, or physician assistant shall assist with the administration of insulin or administer glucagon. Prescriber authorization and parental consent shall be obtained for any employee who is not a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, physician, or physician assistant to assist with the administration of insulin and administer glucagon.</p><p>Code 1950, § 22-241; 1956, c. 656; 1980, c. 559; 1990, c. 797; 1991, c. 295; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>; 1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">597</a>; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">871</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">570</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">757</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">498</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">530</a>; 2021, Sp.
