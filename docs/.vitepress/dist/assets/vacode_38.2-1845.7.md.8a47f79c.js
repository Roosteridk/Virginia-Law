If the Commission is of the opinion that any applicant for public adjuster license is not of good character or does not have a good reputation for honesty, it may refuse to issue the license, subject to the right of the applicant to demand a hearing on the application. If the Commission refuses to issue a new license, it shall give the applicant at least 10 calendar days&#39; notice in writing of the time and place of the hearing, if a hearing is requested. The notice shall contain a statement of the objections to the issuance of the license. The notice may be given to the applicant by registered or certified mail, sent to the last known address of record, or the last known business address if the address of record is incorrect, or in any other lawful manner the Commission prescribes. The Commission may summon witnesses to testify with respect to the applicant, and the applicant may introduce evidence in his or its behalf. No applicant to whom a license is refused after a hearing shall again apply for a license until after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of the Commission&#39;s order or such other period as the Commission prescribes in its order.</p><p>B.
