It may make provisions for:</p><ol><li><p>The use by the authority of all or a portion of the disposal capacity of such system for the authority&#39;s present or future requirements;</p></li><li><p>The delivery by or for the account of the authority of specified quantities of refuse, whether or not the authority collects such refuse;</p></li><li><p>The making of payments in respect of such quantities of refuse, whether or not the refuse is delivered, including payments in respect of revenues lost if such refuse is not delivered;</p></li><li><p>Adjustments to payments to be made by the authority because of inflation, changes in energy prices or residue disposal costs, taxes imposed upon the system, or other events beyond the control of the entity or in respect of the actual costs of maintaining, repairing, or operating the system, including debt service or capital lease payments, capital costs, or other financing charges relating to the system; and</p></li><li><p>The collection by the entity of fees, rates, or charges from persons using disposal capacity for which the authority has contracted.</p></li></ol><p>The authority may fix, charge, and collect fees, rates, and charges for services furnished or made available by the entity operating the system to provide sufficient funds at all times during the term of the contract, together with other funds available to the authority for such purposes, to pay all amounts due from time to time under such contract and to provide a margin of safety for such payment. The authority may covenant with the entity to establish and maintain fees, rates, and charges at such levels during the term of the contract for such purposes.</p><p>Such fees, rates, and charges shall not apply to refuse generated, purchased, or utilized by any enterprise located in the service area and engaged in the business of manufacturing, mining, processing, refining, or conversion that is not disposed at or through such system.</p><p>The fees, rates, and charges may be imposed upon the owners, tenants, or occupants of each occupied lot or parcel of land that the authority determines (with the concurrence at the time of such determination of the local government in which such parcel is located) is in the service area, or portion thereof, of the system for which the authority has contracted, whether or not refuse generated from such parcel is actually delivered to such system.</p><p>The fees, rates, and charges shall be fixed in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection D of § <a href="/vacode/15.2-5136/">15.2-5136</a>. Such fees, rates, and charges may be allocated among the owners, tenants, or occupants of each lot or parcel of land that the authority determines is in the service area, or portion thereof, of the system for which the authority has contracted. Such allocation may be based upon:</p><ol><li><p>Waste generation estimates, the average number of persons residing, working in, or otherwise connected with such premises, the type and character of such premises, or upon any combination of the foregoing factors;</p></li><li><p>The amount of refuse delivered to such system;</p></li><li><p>The assessed value of such parcels; or</p></li><li><p>A combination of the foregoing.</p></li></ol><p>There shall be a lien on real estate for the amount of such fees, rates, and charges as provided in § <a href="/vacode/15.2-5139/">15.2-5139</a>. The authority is empowered by resolution or other lawful action to enforce the payment of the lien by means of the actions described in § <a href="/vacode/15.2-5138/">15.2-5138</a>.</p><p>The power to establish such fees, rates, and charges shall be in addition to any other powers granted hereunder, and such fees, rates, and charges shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of any commission, authority, or other unit of government. The entity contracting with the authority, except to the extent that rights herein given may be restricted by the contract, either at law or in equity, by suit, mandamus, or other proceedings, may protect and enforce any and all rights granted under such contract and may face and compel the performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such contract to be performed by the authority or by any officer thereof, including without limitation the fixing, charging, and collecting of fees, rates, and charges in accordance with this chapter and such contract.</p><p>Such contract, with the irrevocable consent of the entity, may be made directly with the trustee for indebtedness issued to finance such system and provide for payment directly to such trustee. The authority may pledge fees, rates, and charges made in respect of the contract with the entity, and such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time it is made. Fees, rates, and charges so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind, in tort, contract, or otherwise, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the contract nor any assignment thereof need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority.</p><p>The requirements and restrictions of § <a href="/vacode/15.2-5121/">15.2-5121</a> shall not apply to any contract of the authority with respect to the system if the entity for such system will not collect refuse from the generators of the same and there are no such facilities located in the area served by the authority.</p><p>1997, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">587</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">632</a>.</p>',13),s=[i];function n(h,c,d,l,f,u){return t(),o("div",null,s)}const m=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
