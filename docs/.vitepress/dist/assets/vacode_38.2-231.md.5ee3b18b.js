No written notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium that is mailed or delivered electronically by an insurer to a first named insured in accordance with this section shall be effective unless the insurer complies with the applicable provisions of subdivisions 1 through 4:</p><ol><li>If the notice is mailed, proof of mailing a notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium shall be obtained using one of the following methods that demonstrates the date that the notice was sent to the first named insured at the address stated in the policy or to such insured&#39;s last known address:</li></ol><p>a.

If the terms of a policy of motor vehicle insurance insuring a business entity require the notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium to be given to any lienholder, then the insurer shall mail such notice and retain a copy of the notice in the manner required by this subsection. If the notices sent to the first named insured and the lienholder are part of the same form, the insurer may retain a single copy of the notice. Proof of mailing from the United States Postal Service consistent with the mailing method utilized by the insurer shall be maintained for one year from the date the cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium is effective.</p></li></ol><p>b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 a, if the terms of the policy require the notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium to be given to any lienholder, the insurer and lienholder may agree by separate agreement that such notices may be transmitted electronically, provided that the insurer and lienholder agree upon the specifics for transmittal and acknowledgment of notification. Evidence of transmittal or receipt of the notification required by this subsection shall be retained by the insurer for at least one year from the date of termination.</p><p>&quot;Copy,&quot; as used in this subsection, includes photographs, microphotographs, photostats, microfilm, microcard, printouts, or other reproductions of electronically stored data or copies from optical disks, electronically transmitted facsimiles, or any other reproduction of an original from a process that forms a durable medium for its recording, storing, and reproducing.</p><p>G. Nothing in this section shall prohibit any insurer or agent from including in a notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or premium increase any additional disclosure statements required by state or federal laws.</p><p>H. For the purpose of this section, the terms (i) &quot;business entity&quot; shall mean an entity as defined by subsection A of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-543/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-543</a>, § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-603</a> or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13.1-803</a> and shall include an individual, a partnership, an unincorporated association, the Commonwealth, a county, city, town, or an authority, board, commission, sanitation, soil and water, planning or other district, public service corporation owned, operated or controlled by the Commonwealth, a locality or other local governmental authority; (ii) &quot;policy of motor vehicle insurance&quot; shall mean a policy or contract for bodily injury or property damage liability insuring a business entity issued or delivered in this Commonwealth covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle, but does not include (a) any policy issued through the Virginia Automobile Insurance Plan, (b) any policy providing insurance only on an excess basis, or (c) any other contract providing insurance to the named insured even though the contract may incidentally provide insurance on motor vehicles; and (iii) &quot;reduction in coverage&quot; shall mean, but not be limited to, any diminution in scope of coverage, decrease in limits of liability, addition of exclusions, increase in deductibles, or reduction in the policy term or duration except a reduction in coverage filed with and approved by the Commission and applicable to an entire line, classification or subclassification of insurance.</p><p>I. Within 15 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium, the named insured shall be entitled to request in writing to the Commissioner that he review the action of the insurer. Upon receipt of the request, the Commissioner shall promptly begin a review to determine whether the insurer&#39;s notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or premium increase complies with the requirements of this section. Where the Commissioner finds from the review that the notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or premium increase does not comply with the requirements of this section, he shall immediately notify the insurer, the named insured and any other person to whom such notice was required to be given by the terms of the policy that such notice is not effective. Nothing in this section authorizes the Commissioner to substitute his judgment as to underwriting for that of the insurer. Pending review by the Commission, this section shall not operate to relieve an insured from the obligation to pay any premium when due; however, if the Commission finds that the notice required by this section was not proper, the Commission may order the insurer to pay to the insured any overpayment of premium made by the insured.</p><p>J. Every insurer shall maintain for at least one year records of cancellation, refusals to renew, reductions in coverage, and premium increases to which this section applies and copies of every notice or statement required by subsections A, C, F, and L that it sends to any of its insureds.</p><p>K. There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against (i) the Commissioner of Insurance or his subordinates; (ii) any insurer, its authorized representative, its agents, or its employees; or (iii) any firm, person, or corporation furnishing to the insurer information as to reasons for cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or premium increase, for any statement made by any of them in complying with this section or for providing information pertaining thereto.</p><p>L. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an insurer cancels or refuses to renew a policy of medical malpractice insurance as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-2800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-2800</a>, or if, as a result of an insurer-initiated increase in premium, the premium increases for a medical malpractice insurance policy by more than 25 percent of the previous policy&#39;s premium, the insurer shall provide no fewer than 90 days&#39; notice prior to the renewal effective date, or, if such policy is being cancelled or non-renewed for failure of the insured to discharge when due any of its obligations in connection with the payment of premium for the policy, the effective date of cancellation or refusal to renew shall not be less than 15 days from the date of mailing or delivery of the notice. The increase in the premium shall be the difference between the renewal premium and the premium charged by the insurer at the effective date of the expiring policy.</p><p>M. As used in this section, an &quot;insurer-initiated increase in premium&quot; means an increase in premium other than one resulting from changes in (i) coverage requested by the insured, (ii) policy limits requested by the insured, (iii) the insured&#39;s operation or location that result in a change in the classification of the risk, or (iv) the rating exposures including, but not limited to, increases in payroll, receipts, square footage, number of automobiles insured, or number of employees.</p><p>1986, c. 376, § 38.1-43.01; 1987, c. 697; 1988, c. 189; 1989, c. 728; 1992, c. 160; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">237</a>; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">142</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">529</a>; 2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">387</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">678</a>; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">290</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">635</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">554</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">58</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">221</a>; 2009, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">215</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">13</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">257</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">443</a>; 2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">4</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">71</a>.</p>',32),o=[a];function s(l,c,h,f,d,u){return i(),t("div",null,o)}const g=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
