The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection A, B or C has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-88.39/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-88.39</a> or <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-88.40/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-88.40</a>.</p><p>F.
