As used in this section:</p><p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means the donation of money or in-kind contributions.</p><p>&quot;In-kind contribution&quot; means the donation of goods, services, property, or other thing of value, other than money. The basis for arriving at the dollar value of an in-kind contribution is as follows: new items are valued at retail value, used items are valued at fair market value, and services rendered are valued at the actual cost of service per hour.</p><p>&quot;Offeror&quot; includes the offeror&#39;s owner and any agent, managing member, officer, director, or spouse of the offeror.</p><p>&quot;Public institution of higher education&quot; means the same as that term is defined in § <a href="/vacode/23.1-100/">23.1-100</a>.</p><p>B.

Any offeror who desires to protest the award or decision to award a contract pursuant to this section shall do so in accordance with the provisions of § <a href="/vacode/2.2-4360/">2.2-4360</a>; however, no protest shall lie for a claim that the selected offeror was awarded a contract solely based on such offeror&#39;s contribution to the public institution of higher education.</p><p>C. Any offeror that knowingly fails to submit the disclosure required by this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $500.
