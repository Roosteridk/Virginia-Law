A person who has been convicted or adjudicated delinquent of a felony violation of former § <a href="/vacode/18.2-248.1/">18.2-248.1</a> or a violation of subsection A of § <a href="/vacode/18.2-265.3/">18.2-265.3</a> as it relates to marijuana, or charged under either section and the charge is deferred and dismissed, may file a petition setting forth the relevant facts and requesting expungement of the police records and the court records relating to the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication.</p><p>B. The petition with a copy of the warrant, summons, or indictment if reasonably available shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the case was disposed of and shall contain, except where not reasonably available, the date of arrest and the name of the arresting agency. Where this information is not reasonably available, the petition shall state the reason for such unavailability. The petition shall further state the specific criminal charge, conviction, or adjudication to be expunged, the date of final disposition of the charge, conviction, or adjudication as set forth in the petition, the petitioner&#39;s date of birth, and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest.</p><p>C. A copy of the petition shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county in which the petition is filed. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file an objection or answer to the petition or may give written notice to the court that he does not object to the petition within 21 days after it is served on him.</p><p>D. The petitioner shall obtain from a law-enforcement agency one complete set of the petitioner&#39;s fingerprints and shall provide that agency with a copy of the petition for expungement. The law-enforcement agency shall submit the set of fingerprints to the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) with a copy of the petition for expungement attached. The CCRE shall forward under seal to the court a copy of the petitioner&#39;s criminal history, a copy of the source documents that resulted in the CCRE entry that the petitioner wishes to expunge, if applicable, and the set of fingerprints. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall return the fingerprint card to the petitioner. If no hearing was conducted, upon the entry of an order of expungement or an order denying the petition for expungement, the court shall cause the fingerprint card to be destroyed unless, within 30 days of the date of the entry of the order, the petitioner requests the return of the fingerprint card in person from the clerk of the court or provides the clerk of the court a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the return of the fingerprint card.</p><p>E. After receiving the criminal history record information from the CCRE, the court shall conduct a hearing on the petition. If the court finds that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances that constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, it shall enter an order requiring the expungement of the police and court records, including electronic records, relating to the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication. Otherwise, it shall deny the petition. However, if the petitioner has no prior criminal record and the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication was for a misdemeanor violation of subsection A of § <a href="/vacode/18.2-265.3/">18.2-265.3</a>, the petitioner shall be entitled, in the absence of good cause shown to the contrary by the Commonwealth, to expungement of the police and court records relating to the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication and the court shall enter an order of expungement. If the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county or city in which the petition is filed (i) gives written notice to the court pursuant to subsection C that he does not object to the petition and (ii) when the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication to be expunged is a felony violation of former § <a href="/vacode/18.2-248.1/">18.2-248.1</a>, stipulates in such written notice that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances that constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, the court may enter an order of expungement without conducting a hearing.</p><p>F. The Commonwealth shall be made party defendant to the proceeding. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the court may appeal, as provided by law in civil cases.</p><p>G. Upon the entry of an order of expungement, the clerk of the court shall cause a copy of such order to be forwarded to the Department of State Police, which shall, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/9.1-134/">9.1-134</a>, direct the manner by which the appropriate expungement or removal of such records shall be effected.</p><p>H. Records relating to an arrest, charge, conviction, or adjudication that was ordered to be expunged pursuant to this section shall not be open for public inspection or otherwise disclosed, provided that such records may be disseminated and used for the following purposes: (i) to make the determination as provided in § <a href="/vacode/18.2-308.2:2/">18.2-308.2:2</a> of eligibility to possess or purchase a firearm;

(xv) to any employer or prospective employer or its designee where this Code or a local ordinance requires the employer to inquire about prior criminal charges or convictions; (xvi) to any employer or prospective employer or its designee that is allowed access to such expunged records in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/9.1-128/">9.1-128</a> and procedures adopted pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/9.1-134/">9.1-134</a>;
