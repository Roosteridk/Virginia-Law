No locality may require payment of a cash proffer prior to payment of any fees for the issuance of a building permit for construction on property that is the subject of a rezoning. However, a landowner petitioning for a zoning change may voluntarily agree to an earlier payment, pursuant to §§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2298/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2298</a> and <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">15.2-2303</a>. If the petitioner voluntarily agrees to an earlier payment, the proffered condition may be enforced as to the petitioner and any successor in interest according to its terms as part of an approved rezoning.</p><p>B. No locality shall either request or accept a cash proffer whose amount is scheduled to increase annually, from the time of proffer until tender of payment, by a percentage greater than the annual rate of inflation, as calculated by referring to the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), 1982-1984=100 (not seasonally adjusted) as reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Marshall and Swift Building Cost Index.</p><p>C.

Any such proffer provision contained in a proffer entered and enacted on or after January 1, 2012, shall be severable from the remainder of the proffer and shall be void ab initio. In the event that a proffer containing such a provision is entered and enacted on or after January 1, 2012, the rezoning to which the proffer containing such provision is attached shall not be nullified, rescinded, or repealed, however described or delineated, by reason of any alleged breach of such a provision by the profferor, notwithstanding any provisions of the proffer to the contrary.</p><p>2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">552</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">798</a>.</p>',5),i=[n];function s(l,c,f,p,h,d){return r(),a("div",null,i)}const y=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
