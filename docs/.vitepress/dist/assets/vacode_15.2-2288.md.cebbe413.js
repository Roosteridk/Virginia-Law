For the purposes of this section, production agriculture and silviculture is the bona fide production or harvesting of agricultural products as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-6400/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.2-6400</a>, including silviculture products, but shall not include the processing of agricultural or silviculture products, the above ground application or storage of sewage sludge, or the storage or disposal of nonagricultural excavation material, waste and debris if the excavation material, waste and debris are not generated on the farm, subject to the provisions of the Virginia Waste Management Act. However, localities may adopt setback requirements, minimum area requirements and other requirements that apply to land used for agriculture or silviculture activity within the locality that is zoned as an agricultural district or classification.
