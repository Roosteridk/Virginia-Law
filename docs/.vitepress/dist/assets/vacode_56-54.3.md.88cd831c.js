The election shall be effective 30 days after receipt of the notice by the Commission unless (i) the Commission notifies the electing telephone company within that 30-day period that the telephone company does not meet the definition of a competitive telephone company and (ii) the Commission then commences a proceeding to challenge the election. In such a proceeding, interested parties shall be provided notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The Commission shall issue a final decision on any such proceeding challenging the election within 60 days of the electing telephone company&#39;s receipt of the Commission&#39;s notification of the commencement of the proceeding to challenge the election. A telephone company&#39;s election to be regulated as a competitive telephone company shall be deemed approved if the Commission fails to act within this 60-day period.
