The person claiming such exemption shall file annually with the commissioner of the revenue of the county, city or town assessing officer or such other officer as may be designated by the governing body in which such dwelling lies, on forms to be supplied by the county, city or town concerned, an affidavit or written statement setting forth (i) the names of the related persons occupying such real estate and (ii) that the total combined net worth including equitable interests and the combined income from all sources, of the persons specified in § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3212/">58.1-3212</a>, does not exceed the limits, if any, prescribed in the local ordinance.</p><p>B. In lieu of the annual affidavit or written statement filing requirement, a county, city or town may prescribe by ordinance for the filing of the affidavit or written statement on a three-year cycle with an annual certification by the taxpayer that no information contained on the last preceding affidavit or written statement filed has changed to violate the limitations and conditions provided herein.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A, B, and E, any county, city or town may, by local ordinance, prescribe the content of the affidavit or written statement described in subsection A, subject to the requirements established in §§ <a href="/vacode/58.1-3210/">58.1-3210</a>, <a href="/vacode/58.1-3211.1/">58.1-3211.1</a>, and <a href="/vacode/58.1-3212/">58.1-3212</a>, and the local ordinance; the frequency with which an affidavit, written statement or certification as described in subsection B of this section must be filed; and a procedure for late filing of affidavits or written statements.</p><p>D. If such person is under 65 years of age, such form shall have attached thereto a certification by the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Railroad Retirement Board, or if such person is not eligible for certification by any of these agencies, a sworn affidavit by two medical doctors who are either licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth or are military officers on active duty who practice medicine with the United States Armed Forces, to the effect that the person is permanently and totally disabled, as defined in § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3217/">58.1-3217</a>; however, a certification pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 423 (d) by the Social Security Administration so long as the person remains eligible for such social security benefits shall be deemed to satisfy such definition in § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3217/">58.1-3217</a>. The affidavit of at least one of the doctors shall be based upon a physical examination of the person by such doctor. The affidavit of one of the doctors may be based upon medical information contained in the records of the Civil Service Commission which is relevant to the standards for determining permanent and total disability as defined in § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3217/">58.1-3217</a>.</p><p>E. Such affidavit, written statement or certification shall be filed after January 1 of each year, but before April 1, or such later date as may be fixed by ordinance. Such ordinance may include a procedure for late filing by first-time applicants or for hardship cases. Any locality may provide by ordinance that it shall accept such affidavits, written statements, or certifications on a rolling basis throughout the year.</p><p>F. The commissioner of the revenue or town assessing officer or another officer designated by the governing body of the county, city or town shall also make any other reasonably necessary inquiry of persons seeking such exemption, requiring answers under oath, to determine qualifications as specified herein, including qualification as permanently and totally disabled as defined in § <a href="/vacode/58.1-3217/">58.1-3217</a> and qualification for the exclusion of life insurance benefits paid upon the death of an owner of a dwelling, or as specified by county, city or town ordinance.
