Waste load allocations required by this section to offset new or increased delivered total nitrogen and delivered total phosphorus loads shall be acquired in accordance with this subsection.</p><ol><li>Such allocations may be acquired from one or a combination of the following:</li></ol><p>a. Acquisition of all or a portion of the waste load allocations or point source nitrogen or point source phosphorus credits from one or more permitted facilities in the same tributary;</p><p>b. Acquisition of credits certified by the Board pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.19:20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62.1-44.19:20</a>. Such best management practices shall achieve reductions beyond those already required by or funded under federal or state law, or the Virginia Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan, and shall be installed in the same tributary in which the new or expanded facility is located and included as conditions of the facility&#39;s individual Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit;</p><p>c. Acquisition of allocations purchased through the Nutrient Offset Fund established pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-2128.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-2128.2</a>;</p><p>d. Acquisition of allocations through such other means as may be approved by the Department on a case-by-case basis; or</p><p>e. Acquisition of credits or allocations through the implementation of best management practices on lands owned or controlled by, or under contractual obligation with, the new or expanded facility that achieve reductions greater than those currently required by or funded under federal or state law, or the Virginia Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan, subject to the approval by the Board in accordance with standards and procedures that are consistent with those established in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.19:20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62.1-44.19:20</a>. Any such best management practices shall be implemented on lands within the same tributary as the new or expanded facility, and any credits assigned by the Board based on those practices shall be subject to adjustment based on the relevant delivery factor, as defined in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.19:13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62.1-44.19:13</a>.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Such allocations or credits shall be provided for a minimum period of five years with each registration under the general permit.

The Board shall approve allocations acquired in accordance with subdivision 1 d only after the owner or operator has demonstrated that he has made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient allocations in accordance with subdivisions 1 a, 1 b, and 1 d and that such allocations are not reasonably available taking into account timing, cost, and other relevant factors.</p></li><li><p>Notwithstanding the priority provisions in subdivision 3, the Board may grant a waste load allocation in accordance with subdivision 1 d to an owner or operator of a facility authorized by a Virginia Pollution Abatement permit to land apply domestic sewage if (i) the Virginia Pollution Abatement permit was issued before July 1, 2005; (ii) the waste load allocation does not exceed such facility&#39;s permitted design capacity as of July 1, 2005; (iii) the waste treated by the existing facility is going to be treated and discharged pursuant to a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for a new discharge; and (iv) the owner or operator installs state-of-the-art nutrient removal technology at such facility. Such facilities cannot generate credits or waste load allocations, based upon the removal of land application sites, that can be acquired by other permitted facilities to meet the requirements of this article.</p></li></ol><p>C. Until such time as the Director finds that no allocations are reasonably available in an individual tributary, the general permit shall provide for the acquisition of allocations through payments into the Nutrient Offset Fund established in § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-2128.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-2128.2</a>. Such payments shall be promptly applied by the Department to achieve equivalent point or nonpoint source reductions in the same tributary beyond those reductions already required by or funded under federal or state law or the Virginia Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan. The general permit shall base the cost of each pound of allocation on (i) the estimated cost of achieving a reduction of one pound of nitrogen or phosphorus at the facility that is securing the allocation, or comparable facility, for each pound of allocation acquired; or (ii) the average cost of reducing two pounds of nitrogen or phosphorus from nonpoint sources in the same tributary for each pound of allocation acquired, whichever is higher. Upon each reissuance of the general permit, the Board may adjust the cost of each pound of allocation based on current costs and cost estimates.</p><p>D. The acquisition of nutrient allocations or credits from animal waste-to-energy or animal waste reduction facilities, or the acquisition of such nutrient allocations or credits from entities acting on behalf of such facilities, shall be considered point source allocations or credits for all nutrient trading purposes and shall not be subject to any otherwise applicable nonpoint source trading ratio if the best management practice being used to generate such nutrient allocations or credits is a point source nutrient removal technology. Point source nutrient removal technology shall include animal waste gasification in which lab analysis of the animal waste reveals the concentration of nutrients in the animal waste being fed into the gasifier, and the fate of the nutrients during the animal waste gasification process, is known and documented using studies such as air emissions tests and ash analyses.</p><p>2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">708</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">710</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">27</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">288</a>; 2011, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">440</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">524</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">748</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">808</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">756</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">793</a>; 2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">137</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">377</a>.</p>',14),n=[r];function l(s,d,c,h,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const m=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
