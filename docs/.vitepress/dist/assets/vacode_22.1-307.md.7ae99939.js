A teacher shall be dismissed if such teacher is or becomes the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse and neglect, pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/63.2-1505/">63.2-1505</a>, and after all rights to any administrative appeal provided by § <a href="/vacode/63.2-1526/">63.2-1526</a> have been exhausted. The fact of such finding, after all rights to any administrative appeal provided by § <a href="/vacode/63.2-1526/">63.2-1526</a> have been exhausted, shall be grounds for the local school division to recommend that the Board of Education revoke such person&#39;s license to teach. No teacher shall be dismissed or placed on probation solely on the basis of the teacher&#39;s refusal to submit to a polygraph examination requested by the school board.</p><p>Code 1950, § 22-217.5; 1968, c. 691; 1975, c. 308; 1980, c. 559; 1993, c. 498; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">961</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">555</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">588</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">650</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">240</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">56</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">168</a>.</p>',3),s=[i];function n(l,c,h,d,f,g){return a(),r("div",null,s)}const m=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
