A covered voter who is registered to vote in this state may apply for a military-overseas ballot using either the regular absentee ballot application in use in the voter&#39;s jurisdiction under Chapter 7 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-700/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-700</a> et seq.) or the federal postcard application.</p><p>B.

The electoral board shall ensure that the system described in subsection C of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/24.2-455/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">24.2-455</a> is capable of accepting the submission of both a federal postcard application and any other approved military-overseas ballot application sent to the appropriate election official.
