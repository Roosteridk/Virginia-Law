The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and proper to require a separation between manufacturing interests, wholesale interests, and retail interests in the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in order to prevent suppliers from dominating local markets through vertical integration and to prevent excessive sales of alcoholic beverages caused by overly aggressive marketing techniques. The exceptions established by this section to the general prohibition against tied interests shall be limited to their express terms so as not to undermine the general prohibition and shall therefore be construed accordingly.</p><p>Code 1950, § 4-32; 1978, c. 108; 1982, c. 66; 1984, c. 68, § 4-32.1; 1993, c. 866; 1995, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">456</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">630</a>; 2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1029</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP1030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1030</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">784</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">99</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">799</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">266</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">604</a>; 2015, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">604</a>; 2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">132</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">141</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">159</a>; 2018, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">734</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1113</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1114</a>.</p>',7),n=[i];function s(l,c,h,u,p,f){return r(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
