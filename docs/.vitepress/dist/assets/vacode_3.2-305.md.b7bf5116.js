The guidelines may include a requirement for the affected localities to provide matching funds, which may be cash or in-kind, at the discretion of the Governor. The guidelines may require that as a condition of receiving any grant incentive that is based on employment goals, a recipient company must provide copies of employer quarterly payroll reports provided to the Virginia Employment Commission to verify the employment status of any position included in the employment goal. The guidelines and criteria shall include provisions for geographic diversity, a requirement that a project purchase a minimum percentage of Virginia-grown or Virginia-produced agricultural or forestal products to which its processes are adding value, and a cap on the amount of funds to be provided to any individual project.</p><p>2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">466</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">622</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">547</a>.</p>',3),o=[n];function s(d,c,l,g,u,p){return i(),r("div",null,o)}const m=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
