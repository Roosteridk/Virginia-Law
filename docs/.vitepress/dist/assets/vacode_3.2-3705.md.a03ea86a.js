By August 1 of each year, each person who distributes liming material to a nonlicensed person shall submit on a form furnished or approved by the Commissioner a tonnage statement for the reporting year July 1 through June 30 of each year documenting the number of tons of each liming material sold by the distributor for use in each county or city in the Commonwealth. Each person distributing liming material in the Commonwealth to a nonlicensed person shall file a statement with the Commissioner and shall pay to the Commissioner an inspection fee of five cents ($0.05) per ton of liming material sold per reporting year. The minimum inspection fee shall be $35 per distributor per reporting year. If the distributor fails to submit the tonnage statement and pay the inspection fee by August 1 of each year, the Commissioner shall notify the distributor and grant a grace period of 15 working days from issuance of notification for the distributor to submit the tonnage statement and to pay the inspection fee without penalty. If the distributor fails to submit the tonnage statement and pay the inspection fee by the time the 15th day of the grace period has expired, the distributor shall pay to the Commissioner a late fee of 10 percent of the inspection fee, or $50, whichever is greater, per reporting year in addition to the inspection fee due.</p><p>B.
