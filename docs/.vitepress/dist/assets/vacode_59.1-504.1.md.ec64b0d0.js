Language is sufficient for this purpose if it states, &quot;The licensor warrants exclusivity, noninfringement, in specified countries, worldwide,&quot; or words of similar import. In that case, the warranty extends to the specified country or, in the case of a reference to &quot;worldwide&quot; or the like, to all countries within the description, but only to the extent the rights are recognized under a treaty or international convention to which the country and the United States are signatories.</p><p>(3) The warranties under subsections (a) and (b) (2) are not made by a license that merely permits use, or covenants not to claim infringement because of the use, of rights under a licensed patent.</p><p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a warranty under this section may be disclaimed or modified only by specific language or by circumstances that give the licensee reason to know that the licensor does not warrant that competing claims do not exist or that the licensor purports to grant only the rights it may have. An obligation to hold harmless under subsection (a) may be disclaimed or modified only by specific language or by circumstances giving the licensor reason to know that the licensee does not provide a hold-harmless obligation to the licensor. In an automated transaction, language is sufficient if it is conspicuous. Otherwise, language in a record is sufficient if it states:</p><p>(1) as to the licensor&#39;s obligation, &quot;There is no warranty against interference with your enjoyment of the information or against infringement,&quot; or words of similar import; or</p><p>(2) as to the licensee&#39;s obligation, &quot;There is no obligation to hold you harmless from any actions taken in compliance with the specifications or methods furnished to me under this contract,&quot; or words of similar import.</p><p>(e) Between merchants, a grant of a &quot;quitclaim,&quot; or a grant in similar terms, grants the information or informational rights without an implied warranty as to infringement or misappropriation or as to the rights actually possessed or transferred by the licensor.</p><p>2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">101</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">996</a>; 2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>.</p>',16),r=[a];function s(c,h,l,d,f,p){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const m=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
