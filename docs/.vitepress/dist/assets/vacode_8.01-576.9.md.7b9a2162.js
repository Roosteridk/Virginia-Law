A neutral has an obligation to remain impartial and free from conflict of interests in each case, and to decline to participate further in a case should such partiality or conflict arise. Unless expressly authorized by the disclosing party, the neutral may not disclose to either party information relating to the subject matter of the dispute resolution proceeding provided to him in confidence by the other. In reporting on the outcome of the dispute resolution proceeding to the referring court, the neutral shall indicate whether an agreement was reached, the terms of the agreement if authorized by the parties, the fact that no agreement was reached, or the fact that the orientation session or mediation did not occur. The neutral shall not disclose information exchanged or observations regarding the conduct and demeanor of the parties and their counsel during the dispute resolution proceeding, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p><p>However, where the dispute involves the support of minor children of the parties, the parties shall disclose to each other and to the neutral the information to be used in completing the child support guidelines worksheet required by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-108.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-108.2</a>. The guidelines computations and any reasons for deviation shall be incorporated in any written agreement between the parties.</p><p>With respect to liability, when mediation is provided by a mediator who is certified pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the Judicial Council of Virginia, then the mediator, mediation program for which the certified mediator is providing services, and a mediator co-mediating with a certified mediator shall be immune from civil liability for, or resulting from, any act or omission done or made while engaged in efforts to assist or conduct a mediation, unless the act or omission was made or done in bad faith, with malicious intent or in a manner exhibiting a willful, wanton disregard of the rights, safety or property of another. This language is not intended to abrogate any other immunity that may be applicable to a mediator.</p><p>1993, c. 905; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">687</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">718</a>.</p>',5),n=[r];function s(d,l,h,c,u,p){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const g=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
