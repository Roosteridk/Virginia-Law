Upon entry of a decree providing for (i) the dissolution of a marriage, (ii) a divorce, whether from the bond of matrimony or from bed and board, or (iii) separate maintenance, where an order for spousal support or separate maintenance has been entered by the court, the court may order a party to (a) maintain any existing life insurance policy on the insured party&#39;s life that was purchased during the marriage, is issued through the insured&#39;s employment, or is within effective control of the insured, provided that the party so ordered has the right to designate a beneficiary and that the payee has been designated as a beneficiary of such policy during the marriage and the payee is a party with an insurable interest pursuant to subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-301</a>; (b) designate the other party as beneficiary of all or a portion of the death benefit of such life insurance for so long as the insured party so ordered has an obligation to pay spousal support to the other party, provided that the party so ordered has the right to designate a beneficiary and that the payee has been designated as a beneficiary of such policy during the marriage and the payee is a party with an insurable interest pursuant to subsection B of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-301</a> in accordance with the terms of the policy; (c) allocate the premium cost of such life insurance between the parties, provided that all premiums shall be billed to the policyholder; and (d) order the insured party to execute all appropriate forms or written consents to require the insurer to provide information to the party beneficiary as to the good standing of the policy and the maintenance of that party as beneficiary to the extent required by the order entered pursuant to this section. Any obligation or requirement under such an order shall cease upon the termination of the party&#39;s obligation to pay spousal support or separate maintenance.</p><p>B. In making a determination under subsection A, the court shall consider:</p><ol><li><p>The age, health, and insurability of the insured party;</p></li><li><p>The age and health of the payee spouse;</p></li><li><p>The cost of the life insurance policy;</p></li><li><p>The amount and term of the award of spousal support or separate maintenance;</p></li><li><p>The prevailing insurance rates at the time of the order;</p></li><li><p>The ability of either spouse to pay the premium cost of the life insurance; and</p></li><li><p>Such other factors as the court deems necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair order.</p></li></ol><p>C. Upon motion of either party, any order entered pursuant to this section may be modified upon a material change of circumstances, including a change in marital status of the payor spouse, and in consideration of the factors set forth in subsection B. This provision shall not permit the change in marital status of the payor spouse to be considered as a factor under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-107.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">20-107.1</a> or considered a material change in circumstances in any proceeding related to the modification of spousal support.</p><p>D. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an independent cause of action on the part of any beneficiary against the insurer or to require an insurer to provide information relating to such policy to any person other than the policyholder without the written consent of the policyholder or unless ordered by the court.</p><p>E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require an insurance company to renew or reinstate any insurance policy other than as provided in such insurance policy.</p><p>F. In the event a group policy issued by an employer that is subject to a court order pursuant to this section is terminated or canceled by the employer or there is an involuntary change in employment by the payor causing the policy to no longer be in effect, such circumstances shall not be the basis of any finding of contempt against the payor arising out of an order entered pursuant to this section.</p><p>G. This section shall not apply to any second to die insurance policies on the lives of the payor and payee.</p><p>H. In the case of a term life insurance policy that has the ability to convert to a permanent policy, the court shall not impose an obligation to pay for such a conversion.</p><p>2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">797</a>.</p>',11),n=[i];function s(c,h,p,l,d,u){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
