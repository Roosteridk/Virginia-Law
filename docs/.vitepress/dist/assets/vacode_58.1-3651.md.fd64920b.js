As used in this subsection, donations shall include the providing of personal services or the contribution of in-kind or other material services;</p></li><li><p>Whether the organization provides services for the common good of the public;</p></li><li><p>Whether a substantial part of the activities of the organization involves carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to influence legislation and whether the organization participates in, or intervenes in, any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office;</p></li><li><p>The revenue impact to the locality and its taxpayers of exempting the property; and</p></li><li><p>Any other criteria, facts and circumstances that the governing body deems pertinent to the adoption of such ordinance.</p></li></ol><p>C.
