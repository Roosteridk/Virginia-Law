If the Commission finds that the formation of a separate credit union by a group desiring such services is not practicable, or is not consistent with reasonable safety-and-soundness standards, it may authorize the group to be included in the field of membership of a state credit union that is located within reasonable proximity, if the Commission finds, based on the information it compiles, that the credit union proposed to be expanded:</p><ol><li><p>Is adequately capitalized and will continue to have insurance on its members&#39; shares and other accounts;</p></li><li><p>Has not engaged in any materially unsafe or unsound practice in the year preceding its application to expand; and</p></li><li><p>Has the management, administrative and financial resources to serve the additional group effectively. The Commission shall not authorize the proposed inclusion of a new group unless it finds that any potential harm to another insured credit union or its members which would likely result from the proposed expansion is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effects of the proposed expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included.</p></li></ol><p>1999, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">63</a>, § 6.1-225.23:1; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">794</a>.</p>',4),s=[a];function r(d,l,p,c,h,f){return i(),t("div",null,s)}const b=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
