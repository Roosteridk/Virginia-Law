The claim of the Department for a support debt, not paid when due, shall be a lien when docketed against all property of the debtor in the county or city where docketed with priority of a secured creditor. The Department&#39;s lien shall take priority over all other debts and creditors under state law of such debtor including the proceeds or anticipated proceeds of a personal injury or wrongful death award or settlement except that the Department&#39;s lien shall be inferior to those liens created under § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-66.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-66.2</a> or § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-66.9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8.01-66.9</a>, any statutory right of subrogation accruing to a health insurance provider, and the lien of the attorney representing the injured person in the personal injury or wrongful death action.

Settlement of the Department&#39;s support liens does not affect the remaining support arrearages.
