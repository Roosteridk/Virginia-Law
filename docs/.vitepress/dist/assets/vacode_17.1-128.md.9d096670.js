The expense of reporting and recording the trial of a civil case shall be paid by the litigants in the manner and in the proportion as the court may in its discretion direct. A transcript of the record, when required by any party, shall be paid for by such party. The court on appeal may provide that such cost may, in civil cases, be reimbursed to the party prevailing. The court shall not allow a defendant convicted of a crime from which the civil matter arose to recover such cost from the victim, as defined in § <a href="/vacode/19.2-11.01/">19.2-11.01</a>, of such crime. The failure to secure the services of a reporter, or the failure to have the case reported or recorded for any other reason, shall not affect the proceeding or trial. The reporter or other individual designated to report and record the trial shall preserve the original shorthand notes or other original records for not less than five years. The transcript in any case certified by the reporter or other individual designated to report and record the trial shall be deemed prima facie a correct statement of the evidence and incidents of trial.</p><p>The administration of this section shall be under the direction of the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p><p>1952, c. 642, § 17-30.1; 1956, c. 699; 1962, c. 419; 1964, c. 533; 1968, c. 358; 1975, c. 640; 1984, c. 752; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">496</a>; 1998, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">872</a>; 2022, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">279</a>.</p>',4),c=[a];function n(s,d,l,h,f,p){return r(),t("div",null,c)}const m=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
