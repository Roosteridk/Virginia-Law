In making its determination, the court shall consider all of the following factors that are relevant to the case: (i) the degree to which the delinquent act was committed with the use of force, threat, or intimidation, (ii) the age and maturity of the complaining witness, (iii) the age and maturity of the offender, (iv) the difference in the ages of the complaining witness and the offender, (v) the nature of the relationship between the complaining witness and the offender, (vi) the offender&#39;s prior criminal history, and (vii) any other aggravating or mitigating factors relevant to the case. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file such a motion at any time during which the offender is within the jurisdiction of the court for the offense that is the basis for such motion. Prior to any hearing on such motion, the court shall appoint a qualified and competent attorney-at-law to represent the offender unless an attorney has been retained and appears on behalf of the offender or counsel has already been appointed.</p><p>E. Prior to entering judgment of conviction of an offense for which registration is required if the victim of the offense was a minor, physically helpless, or mentally incapacitated, when the indictment, warrant, or information does not allege that the victim of the offense was a minor, physically helpless, or mentally incapacitated, the court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the victim of the offense was a minor, physically helpless, or mentally incapacitated, as defined in § <a href="/vacode/18.2-67.10/">18.2-67.10</a>, and shall also determine the age of the victim at the time of the offense if it determines the victim to be a minor. When such a determination is required, the court shall advise the defendant of its determination and of the defendant&#39;s right to make a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to § <a href="/vacode/19.2-296/">19.2-296</a>. If the court grants the defendant&#39;s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, his case shall be heard by another judge, unless the parties agree otherwise. Failure to make such determination or so advise the defendant does not otherwise invalidate the underlying conviction.</p><p>2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">584</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">732</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">414</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">444</a>; 2005, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">586</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">603</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">631</a>; 2006, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">857</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">875</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">914</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">931</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">463</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">718</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">759</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">823</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">592</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">747</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">772</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">877</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">858</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">243</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">750</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">781</a>; 2014, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">546</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">649</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">706</a>; 2015, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">690</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">691</a>; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">586</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">617</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">389</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">826</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">829</a>; 2021, Sp.
