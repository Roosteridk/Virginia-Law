The Board of Education shall incorporate into career and technical education the Standards of Learning for mathematics, science, English, and social studies, including history, and other subject areas as may be appropriate. The Board may also authorize, in its regulations for accrediting public schools in Virginia, the substitution of industry certification and state licensure examinations for Standards of Learning assessments for the purpose of awarding credit for career and technical education courses, where appropriate.</p><p>B. The Board shall also develop a plan for increasing the number of students receiving industry certification and state licensure as part of their career and technical education. The plan shall include an annual goal for school divisions. Where there is an accepted national industry certification for career and technical education instructional personnel and programs for automotive technology, such certification shall be mandatory.</p><p>C. With such funds as may be appropriated for such purpose, there shall be established, within the Department of Education, a unit of specialists in career and technical education. The unit shall (i) assist in developing and revising local career and technical curriculum to integrate the Standards of Learning, (ii) provide professional development for career and technical instructional personnel to improve the quality of career and technical education, (iii) conduct site visits to the schools providing career and technical education, and (iv) seek the input of business and industry representatives regarding the content and direction of career and technical education programs in the public schools of the Commonwealth.</p><p>D. The Board shall develop guidelines for the establishment of High School to Work Partnerships, hereafter referred to as &quot;Partnerships,&quot; between public high schools and local businesses to create opportunities for high school students to (i) participate in an apprenticeship, internship, or job shadow program in a variety of trades and skilled labor positions or (ii) tour local businesses and meet with owners and employees. These guidelines shall include a model waiver form to be used by high schools and local businesses in connection with Partnership programs to protect both the students and the businesses from liability.</p><p>Each local school board may establish Partnerships or delegate the authority to establish Partnerships to the local school division&#39;s career and technical education administrator or his designee, in collaboration with the school counselor office of each public high school in the school division, and shall educate high school students about opportunities available through such Partnerships.</p><p>Students who miss a partial or full day of school while participating in Partnership programs shall not be counted as absent for the purposes of calculating average daily membership, but each local school board shall develop policies and procedures for students to make up missed work and may determine the maximum number of school days per academic year that a student may spend participating in a Partnership program.</p><p>1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">435</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">442</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">483</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">167</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">150</a>; 2011, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">388</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">56</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">500</a>; 2016, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">720</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">750</a>; 2018, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">142</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">388</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">139</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">796</a>.</p>',8),o=[n];function s(l,c,h,d,p,g){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const b=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
