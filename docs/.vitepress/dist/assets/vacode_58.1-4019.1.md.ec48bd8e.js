For the purposes of this section, an &quot;instant ticket&quot; game or contest means a game of chance played on a paper ticket or card where (i) a person may receive gifts, prizes, or gratuities and (ii) winners are determined by preprinted concealed letters, numbers, or symbols which, when exposed, reveal immediately whether the player has won a prize or entry into a prize drawing, but shall not include any &quot;instant ticket&quot; game or contest licensed by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services pursuant to Article 1.1:1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-340.15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-340.15</a> et seq.) of Title 18.2. The fact that no purchase is required in order to participate shall not exclude such game or contest from the provisions of this section; however, nothing in this section shall prohibit any retail establishment from using a Virginia lottery ticket to promote or further the sale of any products except those having both a federal and state excise tax placed on them. Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.</p><p>1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">462</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">505</a>; 2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">884</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">387</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">689</a>.</p>',3),n=[i];function s(c,l,h,p,f,g){return t(),r("div",null,n)}const m=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
