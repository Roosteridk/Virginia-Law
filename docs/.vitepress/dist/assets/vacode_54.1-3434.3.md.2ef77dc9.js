The Board shall provide written notice of the suspension to the nonresident pharmacy at the address of record on file with the Board and to the resident-state licensing agency. The nonresident pharmacy may apply for reinstatement of the registration only after it has been reinstated by and holds a current and unrestricted license, certificate, permit, or registration as a pharmacy from the licensing agency in the jurisdiction where it is located. Such nonresident pharmacy shall be entitled to a hearing not later than the next regular meeting of the Board after the expiration of 60 days from the receipt of such application, and shall have the right to be represented by counsel and to summon witnesses to testify on its behalf.</p><p>The Board may summarily suspend the registration of any nonresident pharmacy without a hearing, simultaneously with the institution of proceedings for a hearing, if it finds that there is a substantial danger to the public health or safety that warrants such action. The Board may meet by telephone conference call when summarily suspending the registration if a good faith effort to assemble a quorum of the Board has failed and, in the judgment of a majority of the members of the Board, the continued dispensing by the nonresident pharmacy constitutes a substantial danger to the public health or safety. Institution of proceedings for a hearing shall be provided simultaneously with the summary suspension. The hearing shall be scheduled within a reasonable time of the date of the summary suspension. The Board may consider other information concerning possible violations of Virginia law at a hearing, if reasonable notice is given to such nonresident pharmacy of the information.</p><p>A nonresident pharmacy with a suspended registration shall not ship, mail, or deliver any Schedule II through VI drugs into the Commonwealth unless reinstated by the Board.</p><p>The Board may refer complaints concerning nonresident pharmacies to the regulatory or licensing agency in the jurisdiction where the pharmacy is located. The Board may take other disciplinary action against a nonresident pharmacy in accordance with §§ <a href="/vacode/54.1-2400/">54.1-2400</a> and <a href="/vacode/54.1-3316/">54.1-3316</a> following notice and the opportunity for a hearing.</p><p>1990, c. 270; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">115</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">662</a>; 2019, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">138</a>.</p>',7),o=[r];function s(h,c,d,l,p,m){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const u=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,u as default};
