As used in this section, &quot;competitive&quot; means, at a minimum, at or above the national average teacher salary. The Department of Education shall conduct a biennial review of the compensation of teachers and shall consider the Commonwealth&#39;s compensation for teachers relative to the national average teacher salary. The results of these reviews shall be reported to the Governor, the General Assembly, and the Board of Education by June 1 of each odd-numbered year.</p><p>1987, c. 240; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">373</a>; 2017, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">301</a>; 2020, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">690</a>.</p>',3),n=[o];function c(s,l,h,d,p,_){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const u=e(i,[["render",c]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
