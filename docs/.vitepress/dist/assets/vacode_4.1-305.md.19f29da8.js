Such person may be prosecuted either in the county or city in which the alcohol was possessed or consumed, or in the county or city in which the person exhibits evidence of physical indicia of consumption of alcohol. It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of this subsection if the defendant shows that such consumption or possession was pursuant to subdivision 7 of § <a href="/vacode/4.1-200/">4.1-200</a>.</p><p>B.

Any person found guilty of a violation of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and upon conviction (i) such person shall be ordered to pay a mandatory minimum fine of $500 or ordered to perform a mandatory minimum of 50 hours of community service as a condition of probation supervision and (ii) the license to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of any such person age 18 or older shall be suspended for a period of not less than six months and not more than one year; the license to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of any juvenile shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of § <a href="/vacode/16.1-278.9/">16.1-278.9</a>. The court, in its discretion and upon a demonstration of hardship, may authorize an adult convicted of a violation of this section the use of a restricted license to operate a motor vehicle in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/18.2-271.1/">18.2-271.1</a> or when referred to a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ <a href="/vacode/9.1-173/">9.1-173</a> et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1.

When any adult who has not previously been convicted of underaged consumption, purchase or possession of alcoholic beverages in Virginia or any other state or the United States is before the court, the court may, upon entry of a plea of guilty or not guilty, if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt of a violation of subsection A, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, defer further proceedings and place him on probation subject to appropriate conditions. Such conditions may include the imposition of the license suspension and restricted license provisions in subsection C. However, in all such deferred proceedings, the court shall require the accused to enter a treatment or education program or both, if available, that in the opinion of the court best suits the needs of the accused. If the accused is placed on local community-based probation, the program or services shall be located in any of the judicial districts served by the local community-based probation services agency or in any judicial district ordered by the court when the placement is with an alcohol safety action program. The services shall be provided by (i) a program licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, (ii) certified by the Commission on VASAP, or (iii) by a program or services made available through a community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ <a href="/vacode/9.1-173/">9.1-173</a> et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1, if one has been established for the locality. When an offender is ordered to a local community-based probation services rather than the alcohol safety action program, the local community-based probation services agency shall be responsible for providing for services or referring the offender to education or treatment services as a condition of probation.</p><p>Upon violation of a condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him without an adjudication of guilt. A discharge and dismissal hereunder shall be treated as a conviction for the purpose of applying this section in any subsequent proceedings.</p><p>When any juvenile is found to have committed a violation of subsection A, the disposition of the case shall be handled according to the provisions of Article 9 (§ <a href="/vacode/16.1-278/">16.1-278</a> et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 16.1.</p><p>Code 1950, § 4-62; 1970, c. 686; 1974, c. 460; 1979, c. 537; 1981, c. 24; 1982, c. 66; 1983, c. 608; 1985, c. 559; 1990, c. 771; 1993, c. 866; 1995, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">374</a>; 1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">626</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">730</a>; 2000, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">325</a>; 2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">338</a>; 2003, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">845</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">849</a>; 2004, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">322</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">461</a>; 2005, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">895</a>; 2006, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">207</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">133</a>; 2009, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">248</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">726</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">813</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">840</a>; 2012, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">250</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">260</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1227</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1246</a>.</p>',10),n=[t];function s(c,l,h,d,f,p){return o(),a("div",null,n)}const v=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
