Whenever it is provided in this title that a driver&#39;s license may or shall be suspended or revoked either by the Commissioner or by a court, notice of the suspension or revocation or any certified copy of the decision or order of the Commissioner may be sent by the Department by certified mail to the driver at the most recent address of the driver on file at the Department. If the certificate of the Commissioner or someone designated by him for that purpose shows that the notice or copy has been so sent or provided, it shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the notice or copy has been sent and delivered or otherwise provided to the driver for all purposes involving the application of the provisions of this title. In the discretion of the Commissioner, service may be made as provided in § <a href="/vacode/8.01-296/">8.01-296</a>, which service on the driver shall be made by delivery in writing to the driver in person in accordance with subdivision 1 of § <a href="/vacode/8.01-296/">8.01-296</a> by a sheriff or deputy sheriff in the county or city in which the address is located, who shall, as directed by the Commissioner, take possession of any suspended or revoked license, registration card, or set of license plates or decals and return them to the office of the Commissioner. No such service shall be made if, prior to service, the driver has complied with the requirement which caused the issuance of the decision or order. In any such case, return shall be made to the Commissioner.</p><p>B. In lieu of making a direct payment to sheriffs as a fee for delivery of the Department&#39;s processes, the Commissioner shall effect a transfer of funds, on a monthly basis, to the Compensation Board to be used to provide additional support to sheriffs&#39; departments. The amount of funds so transferred shall be as provided in the general appropriation act.</p><p>C. The Department may contract with the United States Postal Service or an authorized agent to use the National Change of Address System for the purpose of obtaining current address information for a person whose name appears in customer records maintained by the Department. If the Department receives information from the National Change of Address System indicating that a person whose name appears in a Department record has submitted a permanent change of address to the Postal Service, the Department may then update its records with the mailing address obtained from the National Change of Address System.</p><p>1968, c. 144, § 46.1-441.2; 1980, c. 704; 1981, c. 619; 1984, c. 780; 1985, c. 231; 1989, cc. 439, 727; 1993, c. 24; 1994, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">345</a>; 1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">943</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">994</a>; 2001, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">414</a>; 2010, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">25</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">55</a>; 2012, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">615</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">964</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">965</a>.</p>',5),n=[a];function s(c,h,d,l,f,p){return r(),t("div",null,n)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{v as __pageData,g as default};
