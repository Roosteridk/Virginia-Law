A facility closes temporarily if it closes for a reasonable period of time (i) for renovations to all or a portion of the facility, (ii) because the lease for the facility has been canceled, or (iii) because of a fire, or a flood or other act of God, or other cause not within the reasonable control of the health club. If a facility closes temporarily, it shall within 14 days from the time of the temporary closing provide notice of the date it expects to reopen, which date shall be within a reasonable period of time from the time the facility temporarily closes, to the Commissioner and shall conspicuously post such notice both within and outside each entrance to the facility.</p><p>2003, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">344</a>; 2010, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">439</a>; 2014, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">459</a>.</p>',3),c=[r];function l(n,h,s,f,d,m){return t(),a("div",null,c)}const u=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{_ as __pageData,u as default};
