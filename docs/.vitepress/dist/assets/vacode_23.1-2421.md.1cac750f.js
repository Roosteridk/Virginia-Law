Any bond issued under this chapter may be issued pursuant to or secured by (i) a trust indenture, deed of trust, or mortgage of any project or other property of the Authority, whether or not financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds; (ii) a trust or other agreement with a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the Commonwealth or another agent for bondholders; or (iii) any combination of issuance or security set forth in clause (i) or (ii). Any such trust indenture or other agreement, or the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, may pledge or assign fees, rents, and other charges to be received and contain reasonable, proper, and lawful provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including covenants (a) providing for the collection and application of revenues and the repossession and sale of any project or other property by the Authority or any trustees under any trust indenture or agreement upon default; (b) setting forth duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation, and insurance of any project or other property of the Authority and the amount of fees, rents, and other charges to be charged; (c) providing for the collection of such fees, rents, and other charges and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys of the Authority; (d) providing for the creation of sinking funds and the creation and maintenance of reserves; and (e) setting forth conditions or limitations with respect to incurring indebtedness or granting mortgages or other liens. Such trust indenture, trust, or other agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders, trustee, or other agent for bondholders and restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.</p><p>B. The Authority may grant mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, and other liens on its real and personal property, including its accounts receivable, to secure bonds. All pledges of revenues of the Authority for payment of bonds are valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The revenues pledged and received by the Authority are subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery of such pledge or further act. The lien of any such pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority whether or not such parties have notice of the lien. The Authority may provide for the recording or filing of any mortgage, deed of trust, security interest, other lien, financing statement, or other instrument necessary or desirable to create, perfect, or evidence any lien created pursuant to this chapter.</p><p>C. It is lawful for any bank or trust company within or outside the Commonwealth to (i) serve as depository of the proceeds of bonds or other revenues of the Authority, (ii) furnish indemnifying bonds, or (iii) pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority.</p><p>D. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture, agreement, resolution, or other agreements relating to any project, including those to which the Authority may not be a party, may be treated as a part of the costs of a project.</p><p>1996, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">905</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP1046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1046</a>, § 23-50.16:28; 2016, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">588</a>.</p>',6),a=[i];function s(h,d,c,u,l,f){return t(),r("div",null,a)}const y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,y as default};
