The burden of proof in a proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter shall be upon the convicted or delinquent person seeking relief. If a writ vacating a conviction or adjudication of delinquency is granted, and no appeal is made to the Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court denies the Commonwealth&#39;s petition for appeal or upholds the decision of the Court of Appeals to grant the writ, the Court of Appeals shall forward a copy of the writ to the circuit court, where an order of expungement shall be immediately granted.</p><p>2004, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP1024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1024</a>; 2007, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">465</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">824</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0883" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">883</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">905</a>; 2013, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">170</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">180</a>; 2020, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">993</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">994</a>.</p>',3),a=[n];function l(h,s,c,d,f,u){return t(),r("div",null,a)}const v=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
