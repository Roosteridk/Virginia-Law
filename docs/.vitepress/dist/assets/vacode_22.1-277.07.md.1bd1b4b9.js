In compliance with the federal Improving America&#39;s Schools Act of 1994 (Part F-Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994), a school board shall expel from school attendance for a period of not less than one year any student whom such school board has determined, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article, to have possessed a firearm on school property or at a school-sponsored activity as prohibited by § <a href="/vacode/18.2-308.1/">18.2-308.1</a> or to have possessed a firearm or destructive device as defined in subsection E, a firearm muffler or firearm silencer, or a pneumatic gun as defined in subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/15.2-915.4/">15.2-915.4</a> on school property or at a school-sponsored activity. A school administrator, pursuant to school board policy, or a school board may, however, determine, based on the facts of a particular situation, that special circumstances exist and no disciplinary action or another disciplinary action or another term of expulsion is appropriate. A school board may promulgate guidelines for determining what constitutes special circumstances. In addition, a school board may, by regulation, authorize the division superintendent or his designee to conduct a preliminary review of such cases to determine whether a disciplinary action other than expulsion is appropriate. Such regulations shall ensure that, if a determination is made that another disciplinary action is appropriate, any such subsequent disciplinary action is to be taken in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a student&#39;s expulsion regardless of the facts of the particular situation.</p><p>B. The Board of Education is designated as the state education agency to carry out the provisions of the federal Improving America&#39;s Schools Act of 1994 and shall administer the funds to be appropriated to the Commonwealth under this act.</p><p>C.

Local school boards requesting moneys apportioned to the Commonwealth through the federal Improving America&#39;s Schools Act of 1994 shall submit to the Department of Education an application requesting such assistance. Applications for assistance shall include:</p><ol><li><p>Documentation that the local school board has adopted and implemented student conduct policies in compliance with this section; and</p></li><li><p>A description of the circumstances pertaining to expulsions imposed under this section, including (i) the schools from which students were expelled under this section, (ii) the number of students expelled from each such school in the school division during the school year, and (iii) the types of firearms involved in the expulsions.</p></li></ol><p>D. No school operating a Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) program shall prohibit the JROTC program from conducting marksmanship training when such training is a normal element of such programs. Such programs may include training in the use of pneumatic guns. The administration of a school operating a JROTC program shall cooperate with the JROTC staff in implementing such marksmanship training.</p><p>E.
