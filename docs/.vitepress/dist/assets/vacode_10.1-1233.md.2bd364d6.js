To the extent consistent with federal law, any person making a voluntary disclosure regarding real or potential contamination at a brownfield site shall not be assessed an administrative or civil penalty under the Virginia Waste Management Act (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1400/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-1400</a> et seq.), the State Water Control Law (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-44.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">62.1-44.2</a> et seq.), the State Air Pollution Control Law (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10.1-1300</a> et seq.), or any other applicable law. A disclosure is voluntary if it is not otherwise required by law, regulation, permit or administrative order and the person making the disclosure adopts a plan to market for redevelopment or otherwise ensure the timely remediation of the site. Immunity shall not be accorded if it is found that the person making the voluntary disclosure has acted in bad faith.</p><p>2002, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">378</a>.</p>',3),n=[i];function s(l,d,c,f,h,p){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const _=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,_ as default};
