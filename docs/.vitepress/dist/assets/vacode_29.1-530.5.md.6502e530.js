therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration statutes, laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife;</p><p>(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property;</p><p>(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states;</p><p>(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person&#39;s home state:</p><p>(i) Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure an appearance for a trial at a later date;</p><p>(ii) Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</p><p>(iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance;</p><p>(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on the person&#39;s way after receiving the citation, could return to the person&#39;s home state and disregard any duty under the terms of the citation;</p><p>(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person&#39;s home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on the person&#39;s way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;</p><p>(10) The practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and</p><p>(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection consume an undue amount of law-enforcement time.</p><p>(b) It is the policy of the participating states to:</p><p>(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states;</p><p>(2) Recognize a suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat that suspension as if it had occurred in each respective state;</p><p>(3) Allow a violator, except as provided in Article III, subsection (b) of this compact, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on the person&#39;s way, regardless of the violator&#39;s home state, if that state is a party to this compact;</p><p>(4) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state;</p><p>(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state;</p><p>(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state;</p><p>(7) Maximize the effective use of law-enforcement personnel and information; and</p><p>(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.</p><p>(c) The purpose of this compact is to:</p><p>(1) Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner;
