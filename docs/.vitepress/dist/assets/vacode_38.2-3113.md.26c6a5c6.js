Each domestic insurer that issues life insurance or annuities providing for payments that vary directly according to investment experience shall establish one or more separate accounts in connection with these types of life insurance or annuities. All amounts received by the insurer that are required by contract to be applied to provide for variable payments shall be added to the appropriate separate account. The assets of any such separate account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer may conduct. Any surplus or deficit that may arise in any separate account by virtue of mortality experience shall be adjusted by withdrawals from or additions to the account so that the assets of the account shall always at least equal the assets required to satisfy the insurer&#39;s obligations for the variable payments.</p><p>B. A foreign or alien insurer licensed to do business in this Commonwealth may be licensed to deliver or issue for delivery life insurance or annuity contracts in this Commonwealth providing for payments which vary directly according to investment experience only if authorized to issue such life insurance or annuity contracts under the laws of its domicile.</p><p>C. No domestic, foreign, or alien insurer shall be licensed to deliver or issue for delivery variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts in this Commonwealth, until the insurer has satisfied the Commission that its condition and methods of operation in connection with the issuance of variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or to its policyholders in this Commonwealth. In determining the qualification of an insurer to deliver or issue for delivery such variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts in this Commonwealth, the Commission shall consider, but shall not be limited to considering, the following: (i) the history and financial condition of the insurer; (ii) the character, responsibility, and general fitness of the officers and directors of the insurer; and, (iii) in the case of a foreign or alien insurer, whether the regulation provided by the laws of its domicile provides a degree of protection to policyholders and the public substantially equal to that provided by this section and any rules and regulations issued by the Commission.</p><p>D. Each insurer that delivers or issues for delivery variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts in this Commonwealth shall file with the Commission, in addition to the annual statement required by § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/38.2-1300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">38.2-1300</a>, any other periodic or special reports the Commission prescribes.</p><p>E. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any contracts or policies which do not provide for payments which vary directly according to investment experience.</p><p>F. Any domestic life insurer that establishes one or more separate accounts pursuant to this section may amend its charter to provide for special voting rights and procedures for the owners of variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts relating to investment policy, investment advisory services and selection of certified public accountants, in relation to the administration of the assets in any such separate account. This subsection shall not in any way affect existing laws pertaining to the voting rights of the insurer&#39;s policyholders.</p><p>1966, c. 289, § 38.1-443; 1976, c. 562; 1986, c. 562.</p>',8),r=[o];function n(c,l,h,d,u,p){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const y=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{b as __pageData,y as default};
