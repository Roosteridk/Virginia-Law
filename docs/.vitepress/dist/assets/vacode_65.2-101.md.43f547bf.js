The earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of 52 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by 52; but if the injured employee lost more than seven consecutive calendar days during such period, although not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of the 52 weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks remaining after the time so lost has been deducted. When the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than 52 weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, provided that results fair and just to both parties will be thereby obtained. When, by reason of a shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the casual nature or terms of his employment, it is impractical to compute the average weekly wages as above defined, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks previous to the injury was being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community.</li></ol><p>b. When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Whenever allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu of wages are a specified part of the wage contract, they shall be deemed a part of his earnings.

For the purposes of workers&#39; compensation insurance premium calculations, the monthly payroll for each volunteer firefighter or volunteer who is an individual who meets the definition of &quot;emergency medical services personnel&quot; in § <a href="/vacode/32.1-111.1/">32.1-111.1</a> shall be deemed to be $300.</p></li><li><p>The average weekly wage of persons, other than those covered in subdivision 3 of this definition, who respond to a hazardous materials incident at the request of the Department of Emergency Management shall be based upon the earnings of such persons from their primary employers.</p></li></ol><p>&quot;Award&quot; means the grant or denial of benefits or other relief under this title or any rule adopted pursuant thereto.</p><p>&quot;Change in condition&quot; means a change in physical condition of the employee as well as any change in the conditions under which compensation was awarded, suspended, or terminated which would affect the right to, amount of, or duration of compensation.</p><p>&quot;Client company&quot; means any person that enters into an agreement for professional employer services with a professional employer organization.</p><p>&quot;Coemployee&quot; means an employee performing services pursuant to an agreement for professional employer services between a client company and a professional employer organization.</p><p>&quot;Commission&quot; means the Virginia Workers&#39; Compensation Commission as well as its former designation as the Virginia Industrial Commission.</p><p>&quot;Employee&quot; means:</p><ol><li>a.

If they are neither employed nor self-employed, those benefits shall terminate when they are able to return to their military duties.
