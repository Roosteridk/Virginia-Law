When a person is convicted of any offense committed on or after January 1, 2000, under Article 1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-247</a> et seq.) or Article 1.1 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-265.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-265.1</a> et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2, and such offense is punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, or when a person is convicted for a second offense of petit larceny, the court shall order the person to undergo a substance abuse screening as part of the sentence if the defendant&#39;s sentence includes probation supervision by a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9.1-173</a> et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1 or participation in a local alcohol safety action program. Whenever a court requires a person to enter into and successfully complete an alcohol safety action program pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-271.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">18.2-271.1</a> for a second offense of the type described therein, or orders an evaluation of a person to be conducted by an alcohol safety action program pursuant to any provision of § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-391</a>, the alcohol safety action program shall assess such person&#39;s degree of alcohol abuse before determining the appropriate level of treatment to be provided or to be recommended for such person being evaluated pursuant to § <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">46.2-391</a>.</p><p>The court may order such screening upon conviction as part of the sentence of any other Class 1 misdemeanor if the defendant&#39;s sentence includes probation supervision by a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to Article 9 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9.1-173</a> et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1, participation in a local alcohol safety action program or any other sanction and the court has reason to believe the defendant has a substance abuse or dependence problem.</p><p>B. A substance abuse screening ordered pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the local alcohol safety action program. When an offender is ordered to enter local community-based probation services established pursuant to Article 9 (§ <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/9.1-173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9.1-173</a> et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 9.1, rather than the local alcohol safety action program, the local community-based probation services agency shall be responsible for the screening. However, if a local community-based probation services agency has not been established for the locality, the local alcohol safety action program shall conduct the screening as part of the sentence.</p><p>C. If the screening indicates that the person has a substance abuse or dependence problem, an assessment shall be completed and if the assessment confirms that the person has a substance abuse or dependence problem, as a condition of a suspended sentence and probation, the court shall order the person to complete the substance abuse education and intervention component, or both as appropriate, of the local alcohol safety action program or such other agency providing treatment programs or services, if available, such as in the opinion of the court would be best suited to the needs of the person. If the referral is to the local alcohol safety action program, the program may charge a fee for the education and intervention component, or both, not to exceed $300, based upon the defendant&#39;s ability to pay.</p><p>1998, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">783</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">840</a>; 1999, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">891</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">913</a>; 2000, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">958</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">980</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1040</a>; 2007, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">133</a>; 2008, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">762</a>.</p>',6),s=[n];function i(l,c,h,d,p,f){return a(),r("div",null,s)}const u=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{b as __pageData,u as default};
