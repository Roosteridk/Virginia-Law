The condominium instruments may authorize the declarant, or a managing agent or some other person selected or to be selected by the declarant, to appoint and remove some or all of the officers of the unit owners&#39; association or its executive board, or to exercise powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the condominium instruments and by this chapter to the unit owners&#39; association, the officers, or the executive board. The declarant, managing agent, or other person selected by the declarant to so appoint and remove officers or the executive board or to exercise such powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned to the unit owners&#39; association, the officers, or the executive board shall be subject to liability as fiduciaries of the unit owners for their action or omissions during the period of declarant control as specified in the condominium instruments or, if not so specified, within such period as defined in this section. But no amendment to the condominium instruments shall increase the scope of such authorization if there is any unit owner other than the declarant, and no such authorization shall be valid after the time limit set by the condominium instruments or after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interests in the common elements appertain have been conveyed, whichever occurs first. For the purposes of the preceding sentence only, the calculation of the fraction of undivided interest shall be based upon the total undivided interests assigned or to be assigned to all units registered with the Common Interest Community Board pursuant to subsection B of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1978/">55.1-1978</a> and described pursuant to subdivision A 4, B 2, or C 8 of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1916/">55.1-1916</a>.</p><p>B. The time limit initially set by the condominium instruments shall not exceed five years in the case of an expandable condominium; three years in the case of a condominium other than an expandable condominium, containing any convertible land; or two years in the case of any other condominium. Such time period shall begin upon settlement of the first unit to be sold in any portion of the condominium.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of the declarant, such time limits may be extended for a period not to exceed 15 years from the settlement of the first unit to be sold in any portion of the condominium or after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interests in the common elements appertain have been conveyed, whichever occurs first, provided that (i) a special meeting is held prior to the expiration of the initial period of declarant control; (ii) at such special meeting, the extension of such time limits is approved by a two-thirds affirmative vote of the unit owners other than the declarant; and (iii) at such special meeting, there is an election of a warranty review committee consisting of no fewer than three persons unaffiliated with the declarant.</p><p>Prior to any such vote, the declarant shall furnish to the unit owners in the notice of such special meeting made in accordance with § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1949/">55.1-1949</a> a written statement in a form provided by the Common Interest Community Board that discloses that an affirmative vote extends the right of the declarant, or a managing agent or some other person selected by the declarant, to (a) appoint and remove some or all of the officers of the unit owners&#39; association or its executive board and (b) exercise powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the condominium instruments and by this chapter. In addition, such statement shall contain both a notice of the effect of the extension of declarant control on the enforcement of the warranty against structural defects provided by the declarant in accordance with § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1955/">55.1-1955</a> and a statement that a unit owner is advised to exercise whatever due diligence the unit owner deems necessary to protect his interest.</p><p>C. If entered into any time prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, no contract or lease entered into with the declarant or any entity controlled by the declarant, management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities, which is directly or indirectly made by or on behalf of the unit owners&#39; association, its executive board, or the unit owners as a group, shall be entered into for a period in excess of two years. Any such contract or agreement entered into on or after July 1, 1978, may be terminated without penalty by the unit owners&#39; association or its executive board upon not less than 90 days&#39; written notice to the other party given not later than 60 days after the expiration of the period of declarant control. Any such contract or agreement may be renewed for periods not in excess of two years; however, at the end of any two-year period the unit owners&#39; association or its executive board may terminate any further renewals or extensions of such contract or agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any lease referred to in § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1910/">55.1-1910</a> or subject to subsection E of § <a href="/vacode/55.1-1916/">55.1-1916</a>.</p><p>D. If entered into at any time prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, any contract, lease, or agreement, other than those subject to the provisions of subsection C, may be entered into by or on behalf of the unit owners&#39; association, its executive board, or the unit owners as a group, if such contract, lease, or agreement is bona fide and is commercially reasonable to the unit owners&#39; association at the time entered into under the circumstances.</p><p>E. This section does not apply to any contract, incidental to the disposition of a condominium unit, to provide to a unit owner for the duration of such unit owner&#39;s life, or for any term in excess of one year, nursing services, medical services, other health-related services, board and lodging and care as necessary, or any combination of such services. The rule of property law known as the rule restricting unreasonable restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat any provision of the condominium instruments requiring that the unit owners be parties to such contracts.</p><p>F. If the unit owners&#39; association is not in existence or does not have officers at the time of the creation of the condominium, the declarant shall, until there is such an association with such officers, have the power and the responsibility to act in all instances where this chapter requires action by the unit owners&#39; association, its executive board, or any officer.</p><p>G. Thirty days prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, the declarant shall notify the governing body of the locality in which the condominium is located of the forthcoming termination of declarant control. Prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, the local governing body or an agency designated by the local governing body shall advise the principal elected officer of the condominium unit owners&#39; association of any outstanding violations of applicable building codes or local ordinances or other deficiencies of record.</p><p>H. Within 45 days from the expiration of the period of declarant control, the declarant shall deliver to the president of the unit owners&#39; association or his designated agent (i) all unit owners&#39; association books and records held by or controlled by the declarant, including minute books and all rules, regulations, and amendments to such rules and regulations that may have been promulgated; (ii) an accurate and complete statement of receipts and expenditures prepared using the accrual method of accounting from the date of the recording of the condominium instruments to the end of the regular accounting period immediately succeeding the first annual meeting of the unit owners, not to exceed 60 days from the date of the election; (iii) a copy of the latest available approved plans and specifications for all improvements in the project or as-built plans, if available; (iv) all association insurance policies that are currently in force; (v) written unexpired warranties of the contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers, if any; (vi) contracts in which the association is a contracting party, if any; (vii) a list of manufacturers of paints, roofing materials, and other similar materials if specified for use on the condominium property; and (viii) an inventory and description of stormwater facilities located on the common elements or which otherwise serve the condominium and for which the unit owners&#39; association has, or subsequently may have, maintenance, repair, or replacement responsibility, together with the requirements for maintenance thereof.</p><p>The requirement for delivery of stormwater facility information required by clause (viii) shall be deemed satisfied by delivery to the association of a final site plan or final construction drawing showing stormwater facilities as approved by a local government jurisdiction and applicable recorded easements, or agreements if any, containing requirements for the maintenance, repair, or replacement of the stormwater facilities.</p><p>If the unit owners&#39; association is managed by a management company in which the declarant, or its principals, have no pecuniary interest or management role, then such management company shall have the responsibility to provide the documents and information required by clauses (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi).</p><p>I. This section shall be strictly construed to protect the rights of the unit owners.</p><p>1974, c. 416, § 55-79.74; 1975, c. 415; 1978, c. 332; 1980, c. 738; 1984, c. 601; 1985, c. 83; 1996, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">977</a>; 2008, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">851</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">871</a>; 2013, c. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">599</a>; 2019, cc. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">712</a>, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">724</a>.</p>',15),r=[a];function s(c,h,d,l,f,u){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,y as default};
