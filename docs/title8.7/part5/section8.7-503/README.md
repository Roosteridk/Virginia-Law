Such a title may be defeated under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.7-504/'>8.7-504</a> to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.</p><p>(3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated. However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with Part 4 of this title pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.</p><p>Code 1950, § 61-44; 1964, c. 219; 2000, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1007'>1007</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0200'>200</a>.</p>
