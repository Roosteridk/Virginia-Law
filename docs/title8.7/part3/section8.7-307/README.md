Any other lien under subsection (1) is effective against the consignor and any person who permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked such authority.</p><p>(3) A carrier loses his lien on any goods that he voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 61-30 to 61-35; 1964, c. 219; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0200'>200</a>.</p>
