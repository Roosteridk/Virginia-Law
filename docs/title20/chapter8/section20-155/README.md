<p>Married persons may enter into agreements with each other for the purpose of settling the rights and obligations of either or both of them, to the same extent, with the same effect, and subject to the same conditions, as provided in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-147/'>20-147</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/20-154/'>20-154</a> for agreements between prospective spouses, except that such marital agreements shall become effective immediately upon their execution. If the terms of such agreement are (i) contained in a court order endorsed by counsel or the parties or (ii) recorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally, the agreement is not required to be in writing and is considered to be executed. A reconciliation of the parties after the signing of a separation or property settlement agreement shall abrogate such agreement unless otherwise expressly set forth in the agreement.</p><p>1987, c. 41; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0638'>638</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0662'>662</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0669'>669</a>.</p>
