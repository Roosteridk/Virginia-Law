# ยง 20-146.18 Inconvenient forum.

<p>A. A court of this Commonwealth that has jurisdiction under this act to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.</p><p>B. Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to present evidence and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</p><p>1. Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</p><p>2. The length of time the child has resided outside this Commonwealth;</p><p>3. The distance between the court in this Commonwealth and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</p><p>4. The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</p><p>5. Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</p><p>6. The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</p><p>7. The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and</p><p>8. The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</p><p>C. If a court of this Commonwealth determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</p><p>D. A court of this Commonwealth may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this act if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.</p><p>1979, c. 229, ยง 20-130; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0305'>305</a>.</p>
