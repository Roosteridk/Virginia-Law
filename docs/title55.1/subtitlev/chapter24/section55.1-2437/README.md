<p>If no person appears and shows that he has title to the property, the court shall order that the residue or other property belongs to the Commonwealth and enforce the collection thereof or of the proceeds of the sale of such property, provided, however, that if the residue or other property was given, bequeathed, or devised by will to a charitable institution in the Commonwealth and such gift, bequest, or devise failed by reason of insufficient witnessing of such will and would otherwise escheat to the Commonwealth, and the court finds that it is in the public interest, the court may order such residue or other property, or so much thereof as was subject to such gift, bequest, or devise, to be paid to such charitable institution.</p><p>Code 1919, ยง 520; Code 1950, ยง 55-199; 1977, c. 488; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712'>712</a>.</p>
