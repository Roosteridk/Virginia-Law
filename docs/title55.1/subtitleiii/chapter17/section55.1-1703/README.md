# ยง 55.1-1703 Lessee of life tenant may hold land through end of year on death of tenant; apportionment of rent.

<p>If there is a tenant for life or other uncertain interest in land that is leased to another, upon the death of such tenant for life or termination of such other uncertain interest, the lessee may hold the land through the end of the current year of the tenancy, paying rent. The rent, if it is reserved in money, shall be apportioned between the tenant for life or other uncertain interest, or his personal representative, and those who succeed to the land. If rent is reserved in kind, it shall be paid to the tenant for life or other uncertain interest, or his personal representative, and the tenant or his personal representative, as the case may be, shall pay to those who succeed to the land a reasonable rent, in money, from the expiration of the life estate or other uncertain interest to the end of the current year of the tenancy. The rent to be paid to those who succeed to the land shall be a charge in preference to other claims on the rent received in kind by such tenant or his personal representative.</p><p>Code 1919, ยง 5543; Code 1950, ยง 55-252; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712'>712</a>.</p>
