# ยง 55.1-2229 Liens.

<p>A. In the case of time-share estate transfers, unless the purchaser expressly agrees to take subject to or assume a lien prior to transferring a time-share estate other than by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the developer shall either (i) record or furnish to the purchaser as part of settlement releases of all liens affecting that time-share estate, or (ii) provide a surety bond or title insurance against the lien, as provided for liens on real estate in the Commonwealth.</p><p>B. Unless a time-share owner or his predecessor in title agrees otherwise with the lienor, if a lien other than an underlying mortgage or deed of trust becomes effective against more than one time-share in a time-share project, any time-share owner is entitled to a release of a time-share from the lien upon payment of the amount of the lien attributable to the time-share. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio that the time-share owner's liability bears to the liabilities of all time-share owners whose interests are subject to the lien. Upon receipt of payment, the lien-holder shall promptly deliver to the time-share owner a release of the lien covering that time-share. After payment, the managing entity may not assess or have a lien against that time-share for any portion of the expenses incurred in connection with that lien.</p><p>1981, c. 462, ยง 55-381; 1991, c. 704; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712'>712</a>.</p>
