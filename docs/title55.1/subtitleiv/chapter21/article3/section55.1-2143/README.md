# ยง 55.1-2143 Tort and contract liability.

<p>Neither the association nor any proprietary lessee except the declarant is liable for that declarant's torts in connection with any part of the cooperative that that declarant has the responsibility to maintain. Otherwise, an action alleging wrongdoing by the association shall be brought against the association and not against any proprietary lessee. If such wrongdoing occurred during any period of declarant control, and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any proprietary lessee (i) for all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that proprietary lessee and (ii) for all costs that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all litigation expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the association. Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.</p><p>A proprietary lessee is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this section because he is a proprietary lessee or a member or officer of the association. Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed by ยง <a href='/vacode/55.1-2151/'>55.1-2151</a>.</p><p>1982, c. 277, ยง 55-468; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0712'>712</a>.</p>
