The governing body of the county shall be made a defendant by summons or notice to its chairman of the filing of the complaint, and after such service of notice on the chairman of such governing body, either party, upon reasonable notice to the other, shall be at liberty to take depositions to sustain or invalidate such election. Service of notice on any three of the complainants shall be sufficient. The court shall proceed at its next term after such service of summons or notice to determine the contest without a jury on the evidence, oral or written, unless good cause be shown for a continuance, and shall make a proper record of its judgment. If the judgment be that the election was a valid one in favor of the issuance of bonds in the district, the court shall make an order in conformity with ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/21-125/'>21-125</a>.</p><p>1946, p. 181; Michie Suppl. 1946, ยง 1560z5.</p>
