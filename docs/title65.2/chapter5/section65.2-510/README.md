# § 65.2-510 Refusal of employment; compensation for partial incapacity.

<p>A. If an injured employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall only be entitled to the benefits provided for in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-503/'>65.2-503</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-603/'>65.2-603</a>, excluding vocational rehabilitation services provided for in subdivision A 3 of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-603/'>65.2-603</a>, during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified.</p><p>B. If an injured employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment suitable to his capacity at a wage less than that originally offered, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee during his partial incapacity pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-502/'>65.2-502</a>, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.</p><p>C. A cure of unjustified refusal pursuant to subsection A may not be established if the unjustified refusal lasts more than six months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section; however, the six-month period may be extended by the number of days a claimant is totally disabled if the disability commenced during such six-month period. When an injured employee is precluded from accepting employment as a result of pregnancy, the six-month period for curing the refusal may be tolled during such period as a physician certifies medical disability.</p><p>Code 1950, § 65-60; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-63; 1991, c. 355; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0319'>319</a>; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0252'>252</a>.</p>
