# ยง 65.2-400 Occupational disease defined.

<p>A. As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term "occupational disease" means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.</p><p>B. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</p><p>1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</p><p>2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</p><p>3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</p><p>4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</p><p>5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</p><p>6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</p><p>C. Hearing loss and the condition of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/65.2-401/'>65.2-401</a>.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 65-42; 1952, c. 603; 1968, c. 660, ยง 65.1-46; 1970, c. 470; 1986, c. 378; 1991, c. 355; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0015'>15</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0405'>405</a>.</p>
