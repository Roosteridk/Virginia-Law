# ยง 11-34.1 (Repealed effective October 1, 2021) Legislative intent.

<p>The General Assembly finds that investment in energy conservation measures and facility technology infrastructure upgrades and modernization in facilities owned by state and local government can reduce the amount of energy consumed, reduce long term operational costs and produce immediate and long-term savings. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage public bodies to invest in energy conservation measures and facility technology infrastructure upgrades that reduce energy consumption, produce a cost savings, and improve the quality of indoor air in facilities, and when economically feasible, operate, maintain, or renovate facilities in such a manner so as to minimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs associated with facility technology infrastructure. Furthermore, state aid and other amounts appropriated for distribution to public bodies shall not be reduced as a result of energy and operational savings realized from a guaranteed savings contract or a lease purchase agreement for the purchase and installation of energy conservation and facility technology infrastructure upgrades and modernization.</p><p>2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0219'>219</a>.</p>
