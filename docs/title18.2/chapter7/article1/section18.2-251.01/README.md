If the person is determined to have a substance abuse problem, the court shall require him to enter treatment and/or education program or services, if available, which, in the opinion of the court, is best suited to the needs of the person. The program or services may be located in the judicial district in which the conviction was had or in any other judicial district as the court may provide. The treatment and/or education program or services shall be licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services or shall be a similar program or services which are made available through the Department of Corrections if the court imposes a sentence of one year or more or, if the court imposes a sentence of 12 months or less, by a similar program or services available through a local or regional jail, a local community-based probation services agency established pursuant to ยง <a href='/vacode/9.1-174/'>9.1-174</a>, or an ASAP program certified by the Commission on VASAP.

As a condition of any suspended sentence and probation, the court shall order the person to undergo periodic testing and treatment for substance abuse, if available, as the court deems appropriate based upon consideration of the substance abuse assessment.</p><p>1998, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0783'>783</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0840'>840</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0891'>891</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0913'>913</a>; 2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1020'>1020</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1041'>1041</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0133'>133</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0813'>813</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0840'>840</a>; 2021, Sp.
