Such amount shall be in addition to any compensation awarded pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/8.01-195.11/'>8.01-195.11</a> and may be up to or equal to the amount of such compensation. The additional compensation shall be added to any amount awarded pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/8.01-195.11/'>8.01-195.11</a>, and the total compensation shall be paid pursuant to subdivision B of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-195.11/'>8.01-195.11</a>.
