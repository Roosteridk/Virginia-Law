# ยง 8.01-379.3 General verdict accompanied by answer to interrogatories.

<p>Except in actions for negligence resulting in injury to person or death by wrongful act, in civil actions when the court determines that the complexity of the issues warrant, the court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict. In actions for negligence resulting in injury to person or death by wrongful act, the court shall submit to the jury a general verdict form only, provided that the court may submit interrogatories to the jury if otherwise specifically authorized by law, if under substantive law governing the case comparative negligence applies, or if all parties to the action agree that interrogatories may be submitted to the jury. The court shall give such explanation or instruction as may be necessary to enable the jury both to make answers to the interrogatories and to render a general verdict, and the court shall direct the jury both to make written answers and to render a general verdict. When the general verdict and the answers are consistent, the appropriate judgment upon the verdict and answers shall be entered by the court. When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, or when the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not be entered and the court shall either order the jury to further consider its answers and verdict or order a new trial.</p><p>2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0499'>499</a>.</p>
