# § 8.01-382 Verdict, judgment or decree to fix period at which interest begins; final order; judgment or decree for interest.

<p>In any Administrative Process Act (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4000/'>2.2-4000</a> et seq.) action or action at law or suit in equity, the final order, verdict of the jury, or if no jury the judgment or decree of the court, may provide for interest on any principal sum awarded, or any part thereof, and fix the period at which the interest shall commence. The final order, judgment or decree entered shall provide for such interest until such principal sum be paid. If a final order, judgment or decree be rendered which does not provide for interest, the final order, judgment or decree awarded or jury verdict shall bear interest at the judgment rate of interest as provided for in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-302/'>6.2-302</a> from its date of entry or from the date that the jury verdict was rendered.

If no such rate is specified, interest on the principal sum shall be at the judgment rate provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-302/'>6.2-302</a>.
