# § 8.01-267.7 Later-filed actions.

<p>Later-filed actions may be joined with ongoing litigation in accordance with the procedures of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-267.3/'>8.01-267.3</a> or § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-267.4/'>8.01-267.4</a> and the standards of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-267.1/'>8.01-267.1</a>. Parties in later-filed actions joined with on-going multiple claimant litigation may, in the discretion of the court, be bound to prior proceedings but only to the extent permitted by law and only to the extent that the court finds that the interests of such parties were adequately and fairly represented. Consistent with the language of this section and the standards of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-267.1/'>8.01-267.1</a>, the parties may utilize all prior discovery taken by any party in on-going multiple party litigation as if the parties in the later-filed actions had been parties at the time the discovery was taken. On motion of any party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, the court may limit or prohibit discovery by parties in later-filed actions if the court finds that the matters on which the discovery is sought have been covered adequately by prior discovery.</p><p>1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0555'>555</a>.</p>
