The petitioner shall be responsible for all statements contained in the petition and any false statement contained therein, if the same be knowingly or wilfully made, shall be a ground for prosecution and conviction of perjury as provided for in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-434/'>18.2-434</a>.</p><p>B.
