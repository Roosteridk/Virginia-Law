# ยง 8.01-480 Prior security interest on property levied on.

<p>Tangible personal property subject to a prior security interest, or in which the execution debtor has only an equitable interest, may nevertheless be levied on for the satisfaction of a fieri facias. If the prior security interest is due and payable, the officer levying the fieri facias may sell the property free of such security interest, and apply the proceeds first to the payment of such security interest, and the residue, so far as necessary, to the satisfaction of the fieri facias. In the event the property is to be sold free of such prior security interest, the judgment creditor shall give written notice by certified mail to each secured party of record as hereafter specified, as his name and address shall appear on record, of the proposed sale, or to any secured party of whom the judgment creditor shall have actual knowledge. Such notice shall be given to each secured party who is of record at the State Corporation Commission, at the Department of Motor Vehicles, at the Department of Wildlife Resources, or in the clerk's office in the city or county in Virginia, where the debtor has resided to the knowledge of the judgment creditor at any time during a one-year period prior to the sale. Certification of such notice shall be delivered to the sheriff or other officer conducting the sale pursuant to execution of the judgment, who shall announce that except as to such person so notified, the sale is subject to any prior security interest of record, other than one of record at a place where the debtor may have resided more than one year previously. If such prior security interest is not due and payable at the time of sale, such officer shall sell the property levied on subject to such security interest.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 8-413; 1977, c. 617; 1979, c. 491; 1990, c. 553; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0958'>958</a>.</p>
