# ยง 8.01-494 Resale of property if purchaser fails to comply; remedy against such purchaser.

<p>If, at any sale by an officer, the purchaser does not comply with the terms of sale, the officer may sell the property, either forthwith or under a new advertisement, or return that the property was not sold for want of bidders. If, on a resale, the property be sold for less than it sold for before, the first purchaser shall be liable for the difference to the creditor, so far as is required to satisfy him, and to the debtor for the balance. This section shall not prevent the creditor from proceeding as he might have done if it had not been enacted.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 8-423; 1977, c. 617.</p>
