<p>For the recovery of any estate on which a writ of fieri facias is a lien under this chapter, or on which the judgment on which such writ issues is a lien under Chapter 17 (ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-426/'>8.01-426</a> et seq.) of this title, or for the enforcement of any liability in respect to any such estate, a suit may be maintained, at law or in equity, as the case may require, in the name of the officer to whom such writ was delivered, or in the name of any other officer who may be designated for the purpose by an order of the court in which the judgment is entered.
