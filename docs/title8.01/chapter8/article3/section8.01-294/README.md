In such case, the return is due on the next day following such Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p><p>Failure to make return of service of process by anyone authorized to serve process under ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.01-293/'>8.01-293</a> within the time specified in this section shall not invalidate any service of process or any judgment based thereon.
