<p>The judge of the circuit court hearing the case may grant leave to amend the request for a review panel to add additional parties or causes of action in furtherance of the ends of justice except where (i) the request for leave to amend is made less than ten days before the date set for the review panel to convene or for the hearing or (ii) the judge finds that the request for leave to amend is without merit. If leave to amend is granted, the judge may, upon motion of either party, stay the review panel proceedings or continue the trial, extend the time for completion of discovery, filing of pleadings and other procedural limitations periods, or enter such other orders as are appropriate to avoid prejudice to the parties and to avoid unnecessary delay and duplication in the proceedings.</p><p>The statute of limitations as to any party added shall be tolled from the date of the request until completion of the panel proceedings. Leave to add additional parties to the review panel proceeding shall not be granted if the judge finds that the applicable statute of limitations has expired with respect to the new or additional parties or causes of action.</p><p>1986, c. 227; 1993, c. 928.</p>
