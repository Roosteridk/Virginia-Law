# ยง 3.2-5138 Judgment as to goods seized; procedure before an appropriate court; appeal.

<p>Unless otherwise shown, or if the goods are found upon trial to be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other laws, it shall be the duty of the general district court to render judgment that the seized property be forfeited to the Commonwealth, and that the goods be destroyed or sold by the Commissioner for any purpose other than to be used for food. The mode of procedure before the general district court shall be the same, as near as may be in civil proceedings. Either party may appeal to the circuit court as appeals are taken from the general district court, but it shall not be necessary for the Commonwealth to give any appeal bond.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 3-333; 1966, c. 702, ยง 3.1-412; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0839'>839</a>; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0860'>860</a>.</p>
