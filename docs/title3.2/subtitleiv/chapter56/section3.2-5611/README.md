# ยง 3.2-5611 Commissioner to weigh or measure packages and commodities; packages and commodities ordered off sale.

<p>The Commissioner shall, on a periodic basis as he deems necessary, weigh or measure and inspect packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in the process of delivery, to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented and whether they be kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold, in accordance with law; and when such packages or amounts of commodities are found not to contain the amounts represented, or are found to be kept, offered, or exposed for sale in violation of law, the Commissioner may order them off sale and may so mark or tag them as to show them to be illegal. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Commissioner may employ sampling and testing procedures as adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures, and published in National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 133, "Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods," and supplements thereto, or in any publication revising, supplementing, or superseding Handbook 133, for the inspection of packaged commodities in the Commonwealth, except insofar as modified or rejected by regulation. The procedures will determine compliance of a given lot of packages on the basis of the result obtained on a composite sample selected from, and representative of, such lot. No person shall: (i) sell, keep, offer, or expose for sale, any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section unless and until such package or amount of commodity has been brought into full compliance with all requirements of this chapter; or (ii) dispose of any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section, and that has not been brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter, in any manner except with the specific approval of the Commissioner.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 3-708.14; 1962, c. 298; 1966, c. 702, ยง 3.1-932; 1993, c. 604; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0860'>860</a>.</p>
