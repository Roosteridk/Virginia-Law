# ยง 3.2-4411 Abandoned apiaries.

<p>The State Apiarist may deem an apiary to be abandoned if: (i) the bees and hives show evidence of a period of neglect exceeding one year; and (ii) the owner of the apiary has not been identified through a reasonable search of available records. If the State Apiarist deems an apiary to be abandoned, he shall certify his findings in a declaration of abandonment to the treasurer of the locality where the apiary is located. The treasurer shall give notice of such certification to the last known owner of the apiary and the owner of the land upon which the apiary is located by personal service, by posting at last known residence, or by publication. If after 60 days, the owner or landowner has not laid claim to the apiary, the treasurer may hold a sheriff's sale, issue a treasurer's deed to the successful bidder, and deposit any proceeds into the general fund of the locality. If disposition is not made within 90 days of the date of the declaration of abandonment, the State Apiarist may take possession of the apiary and destroy the related bees, hives, and equipment.</p><p>1972, c. 499, ยง 3.1-610.18; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0860'>860</a>.</p>
