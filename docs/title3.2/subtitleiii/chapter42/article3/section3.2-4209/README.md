In addition to the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection A or any other provision of law, the Attorney General may require a stamping agent, distributor or tobacco product manufacturer to submit any additional information including, but not limited to, samples of the packaging or labeling of each brand family, as is necessary to enable the Attorney General to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer has complied, is in compliance, and will continue in compliance with this article and Article 1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/'>3.2-4200</a> et seq.) of this chapter.</p><p>C. On a quarterly basis, and upon request made in writing by a tobacco product manufacturer, a stamping agent shall provide to the requesting tobacco product manufacturer the total number of cigarettes, by brand family, which the stamping agent reported to the Attorney General pursuant to subsection A, provided that such information provided by the stamping agent to a tobacco manufacturer shall be limited to the brand families of that manufacturer as listed in the Directory established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4206/'>3.2-4206</a>.
