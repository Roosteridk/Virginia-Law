<p>The Attorney General or his authorized representative shall have the authority to:</p><p>1. Conduct audits and investigations of (i) a nonparticipating manufacturer and its importers or a tobacco product manufacturer as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/'>3.2-4200</a> that became a participating manufacturer after the Master Settlement execution date, as defined at section II (aa) of the Master Settlement Agreement, and its importers, (ii) exclusive distributors, retail dealers, stamping agents, and wholesale dealers, as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1000/'>58.1-1000</a>, and (iii) persons or entities engaged in delivery sales as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-246.6/'>18.2-246.6</a>; and</p><p>2. Upon reasonable cause to believe that a violation of this article or of Article 1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4200/'>3.2-4200</a> et seq.) of this chapter, or of Chapter 10 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-1000/'>58.1-1000</a> et seq.) of Title 58.1, or Article 10 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-246.6/'>18.2-246.6</a> et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 18.2 has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur, issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, certify to official acts, take depositions within and without the Commonwealth, as now provided by law, and compel the production of pertinent books, payrolls, accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony relevant to such investigation. If a person refuses, without good cause, to be examined or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce a document or other evidence when ordered to do so by the Attorney General or his authorized representative, the Attorney General or his authorized representative may apply to the judge of the circuit court of the jurisdiction where such person is in attendance or located, upon affidavit, for an order returnable in no less than two nor more than five days, directing such person to show cause why he should not be examined, answer a legal or pertinent question or produce a document, record or other evidence. Upon the hearing of such, if the court determines that such person, without good cause, has refused to be examined or to answer legal or pertinent questions, or to produce a document, record or other evidence, the court may order compliance with the subpoena and assess all costs and reasonable attorney fees against such person. If the motion for an order is granted and the person thereafter fails to comply with the order, the court may make such orders as are provided for in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Subpoenas shall be served and witness fees and mileage paid as allowed in civil cases in the circuit courts of the Commonwealth.</p><p>2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0758'>758</a>, § 3.1-336.13:1.</p>
