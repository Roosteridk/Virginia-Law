<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/'>3.2-4201</a>, a tobacco product manufacturer who elects to place funds into escrow pursuant to subdivision A 2 of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4201/'>3.2-4201</a> may make an irrevocable assignment of its interest in the funds to the benefit of the Commonwealth. Such assignment shall be permanent and shall apply to all funds in the subject escrow account at the time of assignment or that may subsequently come into such account, including those deposited into the escrow account prior to the assignment being executed, those deposited into the escrow account after the assignment is executed, and interest or other appreciation on such funds. Any interest or other appreciation withdrawn from the subject escrow account prior to the time of assignment shall not be a part of the assignment. The tobacco product manufacturer, the Attorney General, and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained shall make such amendments to the qualified escrow account agreement, title to the account, and the account itself as may be necessary to effectuate an irrevocable assignment of rights executed pursuant to this section or a withdrawal or payment of funds from the escrow account pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/3.2-4203/'>3.2-4203</a>. An assignment of rights executed pursuant to this section shall be in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the tobacco product manufacturer making the assignment, and shall become effective upon delivery of the assignment to the Attorney General and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained.</p><p>2005, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0899'>899</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0901'>901</a>, § 3.1-336.2:1; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0860'>860</a>.</p>
