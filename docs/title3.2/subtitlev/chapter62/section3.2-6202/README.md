Except as provided in § <a href='/vacode/3.2-6203/'>3.2-6203</a>, no participant or parent or guardian of a participant who has knowingly executed a waiver of his rights to sue or agrees to assume all risks or intrinsic dangers of equine activities may maintain an action against or recover from an equine activity sponsor or an equine professional for an injury to or the death of a participant engaged in an equine activity.
