No refund shall be made of any such amount, however, unless made within three years from the date of collection of the same.</p><p>B. In any case where a licensee has changed its name or form of organization during a license period without any change being made in its ownership, and because of such change is required to pay an additional license tax for such period, the Board shall refund to such licensee the amount of such tax so paid in excess of the required license tax for such period.</p><p>C.
