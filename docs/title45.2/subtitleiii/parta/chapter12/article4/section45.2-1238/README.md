# § 45.2-1238  Revocation of permits; reclamation work.

<p>If a permit issued to a member is revoked pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1213/'>45.2-1213</a>, then the payments that the member has made to the Fund in connection with such permit shall be forfeited to the Fund. The Director shall use such forfeited payments, or as much of such payments as necessary, for the reclamation of the mining operation to which the permit applied. If the cost of reclamation exceeds the amount of the forfeited payments, the Director shall also use the proceeds from the member's bond or other security also forfeited in conjunction with the revocation of the permit in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1213/'>45.2-1213</a>, except that if all of the member's bonds and other securities have been released pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/45.2-1236/'>45.2-1236</a>, then the Director shall draw upon the Fund for the entire cost of reclamation.</p><p>1978, c. 634, § 45.1-197.12; 2021, Sp.
