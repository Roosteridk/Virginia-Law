# ยง 45.2-1641  Developing a gas or oil well as a water well.

<p>If any well drilled for gas or oil does not produce commercial or paying quantities of either resource, the well may be developed as a water well upon the request of the surface owner of the property on which the well is located. Any such development of a water well shall occur only after notice is given to the Director and his approval has been received. Such development of a water well shall be performed in accordance with applicable state and local requirements. Unless the gas or oil operator and surface owner otherwise agree, the surface owner shall pay the gas or oil operator a reasonable sum for all casing and tubing set and left in the well that would have otherwise been removed upon plugging of the well.</p><p>1982, c. 347, ยง 45.1-350; 1990, c. 92, ยง 45.1-361.39; 2021, Sp.
