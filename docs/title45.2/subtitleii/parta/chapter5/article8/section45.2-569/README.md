<p>A. The Director, the Chief, or a mine inspector shall issue a closure order requiring any mine or section thereof cleared of all persons, or equipment removed from use, and refusing further entry into the mine by all persons except those necessary to correct or eliminate a hazardous condition, when (i) a violation of the Act has occurred that creates an imminent danger to the life or health of persons in the mine; (ii) a mine fire, mine explosion, or other serious accident has occurred at the mine, as necessary to preserve the scene of such accident during the investigation of the accident; (iii) a mine is operating without a license in violation of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-535/'>45.2-535</a>; or (iv) an operator to whom a notice of violation was issued has failed to abate the violation cited therein within the time period provided in such notice for its abatement; however, a closure order shall not be issued for failure to abate a violation during the pendency of an administrative appeal of the issuance of the notice of violation as provided in subsection D of § <a href='/vacode/45.2-568/'>45.2-568</a>.</p><p>B. A technical specialist may issue a closure order upon discovering a violation creating an imminent danger.</p><p>C. One copy of a closure order shall be delivered to the operator of the mine or his agent or the mine foreman.</p><p>D. Upon a finding by the mine inspector of abatement of the violation creating the hazardous condition pursuant to which a closure order has been issued as provided in clause (i) of subsection A; cessation of the need to preserve an accident scene as provided in clause (ii) of subsection A; the issuance of a license for the mine if the closure order was issued as provided in clause (iii) of subsection A; or abatement of the violation for which the notice of violation was issued as provided in clause (iv) of subsection A, the Director, the Chief, or a mine inspector shall issue a notice of correction, a copy of which shall be delivered as provided in subsection C.</p><p>E. The issuance of a closure order shall constitute a final order of the Department, and the owner or operator of the mine shall not be entitled to administrative review of such decision. The owner or operator of any mine or part thereof for which a closure order has been issued may, within 10 days following the issuance of the order, bring a civil action in the circuit court of the county or city in which the mine, or the greater portion thereof, is located for review of the decision. The commencement of such a proceeding shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the closure order. The court shall promptly hear and determine the matters raised by the owner or operator. In any such action, the court shall receive the records of the Department with respect to the issuance of the order and any additional evidence at the request of any party. In any proceeding under this section, the Attorney General or the attorney for the Commonwealth for the jurisdiction where the mine is located, upon the request of the Director, shall represent the Department.</p><p>F. The court shall vacate the closure order if the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the order was not issued in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p>G. If it is finally determined that a closure order was issued not in accordance with the provisions of this section, the closure order shall be vacated and the improperly issued closure order shall not be used to the detriment of the owner or operator of the mine for which it was issued.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 45-4.1, 45-9, 45-12, 45-74; 1954, c. 191; 1966, c. 594, § 45.1-5; 1976, c. 598; 1978, c. 120; 1984, c. 236; 1985, c. 448; 1987, c. 470; 1990, c. 963; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0028'>28</a>, § 45.1-161.91; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0774'>774</a>; 2021, Sp.
