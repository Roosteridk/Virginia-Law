<p>The plugging of an exploration hole shall be as follows:</p><p>1. Each exploration hole shall be adequately plugged with cement from the bottom of the hole upward to a point three feet below plow depth. The remainder of the hole between the top of the plug and the surface shall be filled with cuttings or nontoxic material.</p><p>2. If multiple aquifers alternating usable quality water and saltwater zones, or other conditions determined by the Director to be potentially deleterious to surface water or groundwater are encountered, the conditions shall be isolated immediately by cement plugs. Each hole shall be plugged with cement to prevent water from flowing into or out of the hole or mixing within the hole. The length of the plug shall be determined by the Director on the basis of available data on the specific site.</p><p>3. Each exploration hole shall be plugged as soon as reasonably practical after drilling, unless multiple aquifers are encountered.</p><p>4. Alternative plugging procedures and materials may be utilized if the applicant demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that the alternatives will protect groundwater and comply with the provisions of this article. In the event that a hole is more suitably plugged with a nonporous material other than cement, the material shall have characteristics at least equal to cement.</p><p>5. In the event that an exploration hole is to remain unplugged pursuant to the provisions of ยง <a href='/vacode/45.2-2114/'>45.2-2114</a>, the procedure contained in subdivision 2, if applicable, shall be applied and the exploration hole shall be plugged to the extent required by that subdivision.</p><p>1982, c. 269, ยง 45.1-277; 2021, Sp.
