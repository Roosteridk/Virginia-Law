# § 6.2-1017 Procedure for granting or denying certificate.

<p>Before any trust company shall begin business, it shall obtain from the Commission a certificate of authority authorizing it to do so. Prior to the issuance of such a certificate to a trust company or affiliated trust company, the Commission shall ascertain that:</p><p>1. All of the provisions of law have been complied with;</p><p>2. The applicant is formed as a trust company for no other reason than to engage in legitimate trust business;</p><p>3. Financially responsible persons have subscribed for capital stock, surplus, and a reserve for operation in an amount deemed by the Commission to be sufficient to warrant successful operation, but the capital stock shall not be less than $500,000;</p><p>4. Each principal of an applicant has the financial responsibility, character, reputation, and general fitness to warrant belief that the business will be operated efficiently and fairly, in the public interest, and in accordance with law;</p><p>5. Oaths of all the directors have been taken and filed in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1029/'>6.2-1029</a>;</p><p>6. The moral fitness, financial responsibility, and business qualifications of those named as officers and directors of the applicant are such as to command the confidence of the community in which the trust company is proposed to be located;</p><p>7. If the applicant is an affiliated trust company, the trust company holding company of the applicant is qualified by virtue of its business record, experience, and financial responsibility to control a trust company;</p><p>8. In its opinion, the public interest will be served by the formation of a trust company in the community where it is proposed. Authorizing the applicant to engage in the trust business as a trust company shall be deemed in the public interest if, based on all relevant evidence and information, advantages such as, but not limited to, increased competition, additional convenience, or gains in efficiency outweigh possible adverse effects such as, but not limited to, diminished or unfair competition, undue concentration of resources, conflicts of interests, or unsafe or unsound practices;</p><p>9. The operating plan and any other relevant evidence and information warrant belief that the applicant will conduct its business in accordance with generally accepted fiduciary standards;</p><p>10. The applicant has provided a bond as required by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1016/'>6.2-1016</a>;</p><p>11. The applicant is not in violation of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1021/'>6.2-1021</a>; and</p><p>12. Anything else deemed pertinent.</p><p>1993, c. 432, § 6.1-32.18; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0524'>524</a>; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0140'>140</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
