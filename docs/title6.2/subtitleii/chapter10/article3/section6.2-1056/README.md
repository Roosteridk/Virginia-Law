# ยง 6.2-1056 When security not required of trust subsidiaries.

<p>No trust subsidiary with combined unimpaired capital stock and surplus of $200,000 or more shall be required by any officer or court of the Commonwealth to give security upon appointment to or acceptance of any office or trust that it may, by law, be authorized to execute. No trust subsidiary shall qualify in a fiduciary capacity on an estate that has a value in excess of its combined unimpaired capital and surplus, without giving security for such excess, unless:</p><p>1. The requirement that the trust subsidiary give security for such excess is waived by the person creating such fiduciary relationship;</p><p>2. A Virginia bank holding company or a bank owning, directly or indirectly through a subsidiary bank, 100 percent of the stock, exclusive of directors' qualifying shares, of the trust subsidiary files with the Commission and with the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which the main office of the bank holding company or bank is located an undertaking to be fully responsible for the existing and future fiduciary acts and omissions of its trust subsidiary. If such undertaking is filed, a trust subsidiary may qualify in a fiduciary capacity without giving security if the assets it is to receive in such capacity have a value not greater than the combined and unimpaired capital and surplus of the parent Virginia bank holding company or parent bank that has undertaken to be responsible for the acts of such trust subsidiary. If no such undertaking shall have been filed, and corporate surety is provided, the premium thereof shall be borne by the trust subsidiary and not the fiduciary estate; or</p><p>3. If an affiliate bank shall already have qualified in any fiduciary capacity and given bond, without security, and the trust subsidiary or subsidiary bank shall qualify as successor fiduciary, then, if the order of substitution so provides, and the fiduciary for which there is to be substitution consents, the predecessor fiduciary shall remain liable on its bond for the acts of its named successor and no security shall be required of the successor fiduciary, if the bond of the fiduciary for which there is to be substitution is otherwise sufficient.</p><p>1974, c. 286, ยง 6.1-32.7; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
