# ยง 6.2-919 Interest on deposits; distribution of surplus remaining after payment of depositors.

<p>When an appropriate court, on a proper application therefor, shall appoint a receiver for any bank or trust company, the court may prescribe and direct, by order or decree entered of record, that the rate of interest to be paid by the receiver upon the claims of depositors of the bank or trust company shall not exceed the current or contracted rate of interest paid by the state bank or trust company on deposits. In addition, the court may fix the interest to be so paid at such lower rate as the court may deem proper under all the circumstances of the case. In such event, the court shall also direct that any surplus remaining after the payment in full of the depositors, together with the interest thereon as so prescribed and fixed, shall be distributed pro rata among the shareholders of the bank or trust company as of the date of the appointment of the receiver.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 6-69; 1966, c. 584, ยง 6.1-105; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
