<p>A. If the Commission finds that a bank is insolvent, that its merger into another bank is desirable for the protection of its depositors, and that an emergency exists, and, if the board of directors of such insolvent bank approves a plan of merger of such bank into another bank, (i) compliance with the requirements of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-718/'>13.1-718</a> shall be dispensed with as to such insolvent bank and (ii) the approval by the Commission of such plan of merger shall be the equivalent of approval by the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of such insolvent bank for all purposes of Article 12 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-715.1/'>13.1-715.1</a> et seq.) of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1.</p><p>B. If the Commission finds that a bank is insolvent, that the acquisition of its assets by another bank is in the best interests of its depositors, and that an emergency exists, the Commission, with the consent of the boards of directors of both banks as to the terms and conditions of such transfer, including the assumption of all or certain liabilities, may enter an order transferring some or all of the assets of such insolvent bank to such other bank, in which event (i) compliance with the provisions of §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-723/'>13.1-723</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-724/'>13.1-724</a> shall not be required and (ii) §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-730/'>13.1-730</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-741/'>13.1-741</a> shall not be applicable to such transfer.</p><p>C. In the case either of a merger as provided in subsection A or of a sale of assets as provided in subsection B, the Commission shall provide that prompt notice of its finding of insolvency and of the merger or sale of assets be sent to the stockholders of record of the insolvent bank for the purpose of providing such shareholders an opportunity to challenge the finding that the bank is insolvent. The relevant books and records of such insolvent bank shall remain intact and be made available to such shareholders for a period of 30 days after such notice is sent. The Commission's finding of insolvency shall become final if a hearing before the Commission is not requested by any such shareholder within such 30-day period.</p><p>D. If, after such hearing provided in subsection C, the Commission finds that such bank was solvent, it shall rescind its order entered pursuant to subsection A or B and the merger or transfer of assets shall be rescinded. However, if after such hearing the Commission finds that such bank was insolvent, its order shall be final.</p><p>1975, c. 44, § 6.1-100.1; 1983, c. 507; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
