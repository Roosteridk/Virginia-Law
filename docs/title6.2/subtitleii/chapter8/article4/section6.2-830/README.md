<p>A. A state stock association may be converted into a bank upon compliance with the procedure set forth in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1144/'>6.2-1144</a>.</p><p>B. A bank may be converted into a stock association by the amendment of its articles of incorporation in compliance with the procedure established by Title 13.1, provided that such conversion is approved in advance by the Commission. Prior to approving or disapproving a conversion, the Commission shall investigate the application to convert as if it was an application for a certificate of authority to begin a savings and loan business, and approval shall not be granted unless the applicant meets the standards established by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1118/'>6.2-1118</a>.

The Commission may grant such resulting stock association additional one-year periods, not to exceed a total of four additional years, in which to conform its assets and operations to the provisions of law regulating the operation of savings and loan associations.</p><p>1982, c. 224, § 6.1-195.57:2; 1985, c. 425, § 6.1-194.38; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
