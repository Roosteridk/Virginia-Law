If any bank fails or refuses to comply with any such order of the Commission, or if the Commission shall determine that a receiver for any such bank should be appointed, the Commission may apply for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the business affairs and assets of the bank and to wind up its affairs as provided in this chapter.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 6-113; 1966, c. 584, ยง 6.1-92; 1976, c. 658; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
