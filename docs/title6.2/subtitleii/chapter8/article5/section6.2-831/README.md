# § 6.2-831 Establishment of branch banks; redesignation of main office.

<p>A. A bank may establish and operate one or more branch offices, and a bank may relocate a main or branch office, provided the bank applies to the Commission for authority to establish or relocate any such office. Applications shall be made in writing on a form prescribed by the Commission and shall be accompanied by the fee established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-908/'>6.2-908</a>. As used in this section, "branch office" does not include any automated teller machine, cash-dispensing machine, or similar electronic or computer terminal, regardless of whether it (i) is located on bank premises or premises properly considered part of an authorized office of the bank or (ii) receives or records deposits, disburses loan proceeds, or provides for electronic fund transfers.</p><p>B. The Commission shall have 30 days from the date it receives a complete application in which to review a branch proposal or a proposed relocation. The review period may be extended for an additional 30 days. The Commission may deny such an application if the Commission finds that a proposal would have a detrimental effect on the applicant bank's safety and soundness or that it is otherwise not in the public interest. A branch office that has been denied shall not be established and a relocation that has been denied shall not be carried out. If the Commission does not issue a denial of a branch proposal or a proposed relocation within 30 days, or 60 days if the review period is extended, the proposed branch office or offices, or the proposed relocation, shall be authorized, and the branch or branches may be established and operated, or the relocation may be completed.</p><p>C. The office at which a bank begins business shall be designated initially as its main office. Thereafter, the board of directors may redesignate as the main office any authorized office of the bank in the Commonwealth. The bank shall notify the Commission of any such redesignation not later than 30 days before its effective date and confirm the redesignation to the Commission within 10 days of its occurrence.</p><p>D. A bank shall be subject to the prohibition in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-842/'>6.2-842</a> against establishing or maintaining a branch in the Commonwealth on the premises or property of an affiliate if the affiliate engages in commercial activities.</p><p>E. The Commission may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $2,000 upon any bank that it determines, in proceedings commenced in accordance with the Commission's Rules, has violated the provisions of this section.</p><p>Code 1950, § 6-29; 1966, c. 584, § 6.1-113; 1986, c. 505, § 6.1-39.3; 1987, cc. 352, 556; 1991, c. 322; 1992, c. 136; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0007'>7</a>; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0026'>26</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0545'>545</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0001'>1</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>; 2015, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0019'>19</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0445'>445</a>.</p>
