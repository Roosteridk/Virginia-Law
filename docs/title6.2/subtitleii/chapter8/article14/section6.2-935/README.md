The receiver's election to reject a lease creates no claim (a) for rent other than rent accrued to the date of termination or (b) for actual damages, if any, for such termination, not to exceed the equivalent of six months' payment. Notwithstanding any other law of the Commonwealth, the statute of limitations shall be extended for a period of six months on all causes of action which may accrue to the FDIC as receiver.</p><p>1983, c. 507, ยง 6.1-110.11; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
