A bank may acquire, own, and hold the stock, securities, or obligations of one or more controlled subsidiary corporations. Such investment in stock, securities, or obligations, together with any investment of the bank in stock, securities, or obligations of a bank service corporation, shall not exceed in the aggregate 50 percent of the bank's capital stock and permanent surplus, without the permission of the Commission, which limit on investment shall not include, but shall be in addition to, investment in (i) a real estate subsidiary as provided in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-873/'>6.2-873</a>, (ii) the stock, securities, or obligations of a building corporation under § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-870/'>6.2-870</a>, and (iii) controlled subsidiary corporations that are wholly owned by the bank.</p><p>C.

Subject to the foregoing limitations on the businesses that a controlled subsidiary corporation is authorized to conduct, and with the prior approval of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may impose, a controlled subsidiary corporation may also engage in any business that is authorized by statute, regulation, or official interpretation for a subsidiary of a national bank or an out-of-state state bank as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-836/'>6.2-836</a> to the extent such activity is financial in nature, or incidental or complimentary to a financial activity, and is not otherwise prohibited by state law. A controlled subsidiary corporation transacting business as a real estate brokerage firm shall be governed by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-888/'>6.2-888</a> and be subject to the provisions of this section. A controlled subsidiary corporation may charge and collect such finance charges and fees or interest rates as are authorized to banks by the laws of the Commonwealth or as otherwise authorized by Chapter 3 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-300/'>6.2-300</a> et seq.).</p><p>D. A controlled subsidiary corporation engaged solely in the business of international banking and finance, and subject to the regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall not be prohibited from receiving deposits or from taking any other action that any such regulated international banking and finance institution is permitted to take.</p><p>E. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-874/'>6.2-874</a> relating to investment of funds in shares of stock of another corporation shall be applicable to controlled subsidiary corporations, except that a controlled subsidiary corporation may acquire, own, and hold stock in a subsidiary corporation if a bank would be permitted to directly acquire, own, or hold the stock hereunder. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-876/'>6.2-876</a> relating to loans to officers, directors, or employees of the bank shall be applicable both to loans by the subsidiary to officers, directors, or employees of the bank and to loans by the bank to officers, directors, or employees of the subsidiary, with the approval of the board of directors of the bank only being required for purposes of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-876/'>6.2-876</a>. The limitations of §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-878/'>6.2-878</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-881/'>6.2-881</a> as they relate to appraisal value, maximum term, and amortization on loans secured by real estate shall be applicable to controlled subsidiary corporations. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, the restrictions set out in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-874/'>6.2-874</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-881/'>6.2-881</a> shall not be imposed upon any controlled subsidiary that has no state banks as shareholders.</p><p>F. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-875/'>6.2-875</a> relating to limitations upon obligations of any one borrower shall apply to the total obligations of any borrower in the aggregate to the subsidiary corporation and to any bank or bank holding company owning stock securities or obligations of such subsidiary corporation. The loan limit of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limit of each bank stockholder prorated in accordance with the percentage of stock owned by such bank. However, in the case of a subsidiary, any of the stock, securities, or other obligations of which are owned by a bank holding company, the loan limits of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limits of all bank subsidiaries of such holding company, which share shall be prorated based on the percentage of stock owned by the holding company and all subsidiary banks thereof. In computing whether a bank or a subsidiary that is not wholly owned is complying with its lending limit, the loans of the bank and the subsidiary to any common borrower shall be aggregated on a basis pro rata to the percentage of stock of the subsidiary owned by the bank. Such controlled subsidiary corporation shall not otherwise be subject to the provisions of this chapter except where it is expressly so provided. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, the restrictions set out in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-874/'>6.2-874</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-881/'>6.2-881</a> shall not be imposed upon any controlled subsidiary that has no state banks as shareholders.</p><p>1968, c. 270, § 6.1-58.1; 1978, c. 797; 1988, c. 296; 1993, c. 64; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0277'>277</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0060'>60</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0508'>508</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0536'>536</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0558'>558</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
