# § 6.2-1123 Notice of meetings of members; determining members entitled to notice or to vote.

<p>A. A mutual savings institution shall give notice of its meetings of members as required by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-842/'>13.1-842</a> and shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place in each office of the institution during the 14 days preceding the date of the meeting.</p><p>B. For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, or in order to make a determination of members for any other purpose, the board of directors of a mutual savings institution may provide that the membership shall be closed for a stated period but not to exceed, in any case, 50 days. In lieu of closing the membership, the bylaws or, in the absence of any applicable bylaw, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of membership. Such date in any case shall not be more than 50 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. If the membership is not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed shall be the record date for such determination of membership. When a determination of members entitled to vote at any meeting of members has been made as provided in this section, the determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.</p><p>Code 1950, § 6-201.38; 1960, c. 402; 1966, c. 584, § 6.1-168; 1972, c. 796, § 6.1-195.45; 1977, c. 46; 1985, c. 425, § 6.1-194.16; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
