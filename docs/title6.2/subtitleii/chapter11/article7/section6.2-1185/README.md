# ยง 6.2-1185 Trustees on loans secured by deed of trust.

<p>Any savings institution in connection with making loans secured by deed of trust is empowered to elect a trustee, which may be a service corporation, at such times and for such terms as may be prescribed by its charter or bylaws. All the rights, titles, duties, and obligations of such a trustee relating to loans secured by deed of trust shall pass by operation of law to his successor in office. Every right of the savings institution required to be exercised by or through such trustee, whether it is the sale of property or some other act, shall be done, enforced and carried out by the trustee in office at the time when such rights are exercised by or for the savings institution. All sales or conveyances heretofore or hereafter made by a trustee appointed in the manner designated in this section shall be as valid and binding as though the sale or conveyance had been made by the trustee named in the deed of trust. A majority of the trustees in office are empowered to conduct sales and make conveyances in pursuance thereof with the same force and effect as though all the trustees had acted; and when there are two trustees either one may act.</p><p>1985, c. 425, ยง 6.1-194.68; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
