At the time of origination, a real estate loan may not exceed 100 percent of the appraised fair market value of the security property. During the term of the loan, the loan-to-value ratio may increase above the maximum permissible percentage if the increase results from an adjustment authorized by ยง <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1182/'>6.2-1182</a>. In the case of a home loan secured by borrower-occupied property, the loan balance may not exceed 125 percent of the original appraised value of the property during the term of the loan, unless the loan contract provides that the payment shall be adjusted at least once every five years, beginning no later than the 10th year of the loan, to a level sufficient to amortize the loan at the then-existing interest rate and loan balance for the remaining term of the loan. The 125 percent limitation shall not apply to that portion of a loan balance that is interest received in the form of a percentage of the appreciation in value of the security property.</p><p>1985, c. 425, ยง 6.1-194.63; 1991, c. 230, ยง 6.1-194.151; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
