# ยง 6.2-1319 Involuntary dissolution.

<p>If the Commission determines that a credit union is violating any provisions of this chapter, it may, after a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing has been given to the credit union, direct that it discontinue the illegal methods or practices described in the order. If any credit union is insolvent, or has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the Commission may take possession of the business and property of the credit union and retain such possession until such time as it may permit such credit union to resume business, or until its affairs are finally liquidated under order of the Commission. Alternatively, the Commission may apply to any court in the Commonwealth having jurisdiction to appoint receivers for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the business and assets and to wind up the affairs and business of any such credit union. The receiver when appointed shall become and be assignee of the assets of such credit union.</p><p>Code 1950, ยง 6-232; 1950, c. 93; 1966, c. 584, ยง 6.1-223; 1990, c. 373, ยง 6.1-225.12; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>
