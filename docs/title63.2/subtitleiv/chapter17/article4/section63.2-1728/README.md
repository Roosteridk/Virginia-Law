Upon receipt of a complaint concerning the operation of an assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency, regardless of whether the program is subject to licensure, the Commissioner shall, for good cause shown, cause an investigation to be made, including on-site visits as he deems necessary, of the activities, services, records and facilities. The assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency shall afford the Commissioner reasonable opportunity to inspect all of the operator's activities, services, records and facilities and to interview its agents and employees and any child or other person within its custody or control. Whenever an assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency subject to inspection under this section is determined by the Commissioner to be in noncompliance with the provisions of this subtitle or with regulations adopted pursuant to this subtitle, the Commissioner shall give reasonable notice to the assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency of the nature of its noncompliance and may thereafter take appropriate action as provided by law, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency.</p><p>An incident report filed by an assisted living facility, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board, for any major incident that negatively affects or threatens the life, health, safety, or welfare of any resident of the facility shall not be considered a complaint for purposes of this section and shall not be posted by the Department on a website maintained by the Department. However, upon receipt of an incident report for any major incident that negatively affects or threatens the life, health, safety, or welfare of any resident of an assisted living facility, the Commissioner may initiate an investigation including an on-site visit to the facility if the Commissioner finds, for good cause shown based upon the seriousness of the incident and the nature of any response to the incident, including any implementation of a plan of correction to address the situation giving rise to the incident, that an investigation is required to protect the life, health, safety, or welfare of a resident of the assisted living facility.</p><p>1993, cc. 730, 742, ยง 63.1-198.03; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747'>747</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0603'>603</a>.</p>
