A human trafficking assessment requires the collection of information necessary to determine:</p><p>1. The immediate safety needs of the child;</p><p>2.

Reports or complaints for which a human trafficking assessment is completed shall not be entered into the central registry contained in § <a href='/vacode/63.2-1515/'>63.2-1515</a>.</p><p>F.
