# § 63.2-1903 Authority to issue certain orders; civil penalty.

<p>A. In the absence of a court order, the Department shall have the authority to issue orders directing the payment of child and child and spousal support and, if available at reasonable cost as defined in § <a href='/vacode/63.2-1900/'>63.2-1900</a>, to require a provision for health care coverage, including Department-sponsored health care coverage, or cash medical support, or both, for dependent children of the parents, which shall include the requirements specified for employers pursuant to subdivision B 5 of § <a href='/vacode/20-79.3/'>20-79.3</a>. The Department shall have the authority to make available Department-sponsored health care coverage for children receiving child support services from the Department. If it appears that the gross income of the custodial parent of the dependent child is equal to or less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from time to time, the Department shall refer the dependent child to the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security plan pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/32.1-351/'>32.1-351</a>. However, prior to referring the dependent child to the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security plan, the Department shall confirm that neither parent has access to health care coverage at a reasonable cost for the dependent child. If a child is enrolled in Department-sponsored health care coverage, the Department shall collect the cost of the coverage pursuant to subsection E of § <a href='/vacode/20-108.2/'>20-108.2</a>.</p><p>In ordering the payment of child support, the Department shall set such support at the amount resulting from computation pursuant to the guideline set out in § <a href='/vacode/20-108.2/'>20-108.2</a>, subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/63.2-1918/'>63.2-1918</a>.</p><p>B. When a payee no longer has physical custody of a child, the Department shall have the authority to redirect child support payments to a custodial parent who has physical custody of the child when an assignment of rights has been made to the Department or an application for services has been made by such custodial parent with the Division of Child Support Enforcement.</p><p>C. The Department shall have the authority, upon notice from the Department of Medical Assistance Services, to use any existing enforcement mechanisms provided by this chapter to collect the wages, salary, or other employment income or to withhold amounts from state tax refunds of any obligor who has not used payments received from a third party to reimburse, as appropriate, either the other parent of such child or the provider of such services, to the extent necessary to reimburse the Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p><p>D. The Department may order the obligor and payee to notify each other or the Department upon request of current gross income as defined in § <a href='/vacode/20-108.2/'>20-108.2</a> and any other pertinent information that may affect child support amounts. For good cause shown, the Department may order that such information be provided to the Department and made available to the parties for inspection in lieu of the parties' providing such information directly to each other. The Department shall record the social security number of each party or control number issued to a party by the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/46.2-342/'>46.2-342</a> in the Department's file of the case.</p><p>E. The Department shall develop procedures governing the method and timing of periodic review and adjustment of child support orders established or enforced or both pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended. If there is an assignment under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act or at the request of either parent subject to the order, the Department shall initiate a review of such order every three years without requiring proof or showing of a change in circumstances and shall initiate appropriate action to adjust such order in accordance with the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/20-108.2/'>20-108.2</a> and subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/63.2-1918/'>63.2-1918</a>.</p><p>F. In order to provide essential information for whatever establishment or enforcement actions are necessary for the collection of child support, the Commissioner, the Director of the Division of Child Support Enforcement, and district managers of Division of Child Support Enforcement offices shall have the right to (i) subpoena financial records of, or other information relating to, the noncustodial parent and obligee from any person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth and (ii) summons the noncustodial parent and obligee to appear in the Division's offices. The Commissioner, Director, and district managers may also subpoena copies of state and federal income tax returns. The district managers shall be trained in the correct use of the subpoena process prior to exercising subpoena authority. A civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 may be assessed by the Commissioner for a failure to respond to a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection.</p><p>G. In the absence of a court order, the Department may establish an administrative support order on an out-of-state obligor pursuant to subdivision A 8 or 9 of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-328.1/'>8.01-328.1</a> or § <a href='/vacode/20-88.35/'>20-88.35</a>. The Department may also take action to enforce an administrative or court order on an out-of-state obligor. Service of such actions shall be in accordance with the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-296/'>8.01-296</a>, <a href='/vacode/8.01-327/'>8.01-327</a> or <a href='/vacode/8.01-329/'>8.01-329</a> or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or electronic means in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/63.2-1917/'>63.2-1917</a>.</p><p>H. If a support order has been issued in another state but the obligor, the obligee, and the child now live in the Commonwealth, the Department may (i) enforce the order without registration, using all enforcement remedies available under this chapter, and (ii) register the order in the appropriate tribunal of the Commonwealth for enforcement or modification.</p><p>1985, c. 488, § 63.1-250.1; 1986, c. 594; 1988, cc. 906, 907; 1989, c. 599; 1990, c. 836; 1991, cc. 651, 694; 1992, c. 716; 1994, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0729'>729</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0767'>767</a>; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0595'>595</a>; 1996, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0491'>491</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0882'>882</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0925'>925</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0948'>948</a>; 1997, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0440'>440</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0467'>467</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0796'>796</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0895'>895</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0898'>898</a>; 2002, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0747'>747</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0844'>844</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0600'>600</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0125'>125</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0713'>713</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0029'>29</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0722'>722</a>; 2021, Sp.
