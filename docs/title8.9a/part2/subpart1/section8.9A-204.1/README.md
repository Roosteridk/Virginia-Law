# § 8.9A-204.1 Security interests in consumer goods.

<p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, a seller may take a security interest only in the goods sold; provided, however, this section shall apply only to the sale of consumer goods as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/8.9A-102/'>8.9A-102</a> (23). Where the unpaid debts from two or more sales of consumer goods are consolidated into one debt payable on a single schedule of payments, and the consolidated debt is secured by security interests in the consumer goods sold, the payments made by the debtor under the consolidated schedule may be applied to the payment of the debts arising from the sales either (1) in the order in which the sales were made, starting with the first sale, or (2) in the same proportion as the original debts arising from the various sales bear to one another. To the extent debts are paid according to this section, security interests in the consumer goods sold will terminate as the debt originally incurred with respect to each item is paid.</p><p>(b) This section shall not apply to a sale of consumer goods purchased pursuant to an open-end credit plan, when previously purchased consumer goods were purchased pursuant to such plan. This section shall not apply to a security interest in a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which may be the subject of a certificate of title under Title 46.2.</p><p>(c) A security interest created in violation of this section is void.</p><p>2000, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP1007'>1007</a>.</p>
