An authority may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided in Chapter 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-200/'>25.1-200</a> et seq.) of Title 25.1. In condemnation proceedings evidence may be presented as to the value of the property including but not limited to the owner's appraisal and the effect that any pending application for a zoning change, special use permit application or variance application may have on the value of the property. The court may also determine whether there has been unreasonable delay in the institution of the proceedings after public announcement by the condemnor of a project that necessitates acquisition by the condemnor of a designated land area consisting of or including the land sought to be condemned. If the court determines that such unreasonable delay has occurred, it shall instruct the commissioners or jurors in such proceedings to allow any damages proved to their satisfaction by the landowner or landowners to have been sustained to his or their land during and because of such delay, in addition to and separately from the fair market value thereof, but such damages shall not exceed the actual diminution if any in fair market value of the land in substantially the same physical condition over the period of the delay.</p><p>B.

Such notice shall not be the basis for eligibility for relocation benefits. At the time it makes its price offer, the authority shall also provide to the property owner a copy of the appraisal of the fair market value of such property upon which the authority has based the amount offered for the property, which appraisal shall be prepared by a real estate appraiser licensed in accordance with Chapter 20.1 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/54.1-2009/'>54.1-2009</a> et seq.) of Title 54.1.</p><p>C.

Thereupon, any housing authority created for each of the municipalities shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing a deed of its real property to the consolidated housing authority.

        "Body": "<p>A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an authority, or any locality, shall have the power to acquire or repair any blighted property, as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-3/'>36-3</a>, whether inside or outside of a conservation or redevelopment area, by purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain provided in Chapter 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/25.1-200/'>25.1-200</a> et seq.) of Title 25.1, and, further, shall have the power to hold, clear, repair, manage or dispose of such property for purposes consistent with this chapter. In addition, the authority and locality shall have the power to recover the costs of any repair or disposal of such property from the owner or owners of record, determined in accordance with subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-27/'>36-27</a>. This power shall be exercised only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.</p><p>B. The chief executive or designee of the locality or authority shall make a preliminary determination that a property is blighted in accordance with this chapter. It shall send notice to the owner or owners of record determined in accordance with subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-27/'>36-27</a>, specifying the reasons why the property is blighted. The owner or owners of record shall have 30 days from the date the notice is sent in which to respond in writing with a spot blight abatement plan to address the blight within a reasonable time.</p><p>C. If the owner or owners of record fail to respond within the 30-day period with a written spot blight abatement plan that is acceptable to the chief executive of the agency, authority or locality, the agency, authority or locality may request the locality to declare the property as blighted, which declaration shall be by ordinance adopted by the governing body.</p><p>D. No spot blight abatement plan shall be effective until notice has been sent to the property owner or owners of record and an ordinance has been adopted by the local governing body. Written notice to the property owner shall be sent by regular mail to the last address listed for the owner on the locality's assessment records for the property, together with a copy of such spot blight abatement plan prepared by the agency, authority, or locality. If the repair or other disposition of the property is approved, the authority, agency, or locality may carry out the approved plan to repair or acquire and dispose of the property in accordance with the approved plan, the provisions of this section, and the applicable law.</p><p>E. If the ordinance is adopted by the governing body of the locality, the locality shall have a lien on all property so repaired or acquired under an approved spot blight abatement plan to recover the cost of (i) improvements made by such locality to bring the blighted property into compliance with applicable building codes and (ii) disposal, if any. The lien on such property shall bear interest at the legal rate of interest established in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-301/'>6.2-301</a>, beginning on the date the repairs are completed through the date on which the lien is paid. The lien authorized by this subsection may be recorded as a lien among the land records of the circuit court, which lien shall be treated in all respects as a tax lien and enforceable in the same manner as provided in Articles 3 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3940/'>58.1-3940</a> et seq.) and 4 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3965/'>58.1-3965</a> et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1. The governing body may recover its costs of repair from the owner or owners of record of the property when the repairs were made at such time as the property is sold or disposed of by such owner or owners. If the property is acquired by the governing body through eminent domain, the cost of repair may be recovered when the governing body sells or disposes of the property. In either case, the costs of repair shall be recovered from the proceeds of any such sale.</p><p>F. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, unless otherwise provided for in Title 36, if the blighted property is occupied for personal residential purposes, the governing body, in approving the spot blight abatement plan, shall not acquire by eminent domain such property if it would result in a displacement of the person or persons living in the premises. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to acquisitions, under an approved spot blight abatement plan, by any locality of property which has been condemned for human habitation for more than one year. In addition, such locality exercising the powers of eminent domain in accordance with Title 25.1, may provide for temporary relocation of any person living in the blighted property provided the relocation is within the financial means of such person.</p><p>G. In lieu of the acquisition of blighted property by the exercise of eminent domain, and in lieu of the exercise of other powers granted in subsections A through H, any locality may, by ordinance, declare any blighted property as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-3/'>36-3</a> to constitute a nuisance, and thereupon abate the nuisance pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-900/'>15.2-900</a> or § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-1115/'>15.2-1115</a>. Such ordinance shall be adopted only after written notice by certified mail to the owner or owners at the last known address of such owner as shown on the current real estate tax assessment books or current real estate tax assessment records. If the owner does not abate or remove the nuisance and the locality abates or removes the nuisance at its expense, the costs of the removal or abatement of the nuisance shall be a lien on the property and such lien shall bear interest at the legal rate of interest established in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-301/'>6.2-301</a>, beginning on the date the removal or abatement is completed through the date on which the lien is paid.</p><p>H.

further, to increase the construction and rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing through the purchase from mortgage lenders authorized to make loans in the Commonwealth of mortgage loans for residential housing for persons and families of low and moderate income in the Commonwealth;

The aforesaid mortgage and instrument evidencing an HDA mortgage loan may contain exculpatory provisions relieving the housing sponsor or its principal or principals from personal liability if deemed desirable by HDA.</p><p>3. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan made to a limited profit housing sponsor, HDA may require that such limited profit housing sponsor not make distributions in any one year with respect to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan in excess of such percentage of such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing as may be determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for such mortgage loan. None of the partners, principals, stockholders or holders of a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor shall earn, accept or receive a return in any one year with respect to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan greater than his applicable proportion of any such percentage of such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing as may be determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan. The right to any such limited distribution or return may be cumulative to the extent provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan. For the purpose of this section, the terms \"distribution\" and \"return\" are intended to mean payments on account of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan resulting from the operation thereof. Any payment to a person or entity who is a partner, principal, stockholder or holder of a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor shall not be deemed a \"distribution\" or \"return\" to such person or entity if the funds with which such payment is made are funds paid or contributed to such limited profit housing sponsor by persons or entities purchasing a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor. At or after the completion of construction, rehabilitation or improvement of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan, such limited profit housing sponsor's equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing shall be established in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for such mortgage loan. Such equity shall be determined by HDA, at its option, as either (i) the difference between the total housing development costs as to the housing development or multifamily residential housing and the final principal amount of such HDA mortgage loan, or (ii) the difference between the fair market value of such housing development and the final principal amount of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may thereafter from time to time adjust such equity to be equal to the difference, as of the date of adjustment, between the fair market value of such housing development and the outstanding principal balance of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may review and regulate a proposed retirement of any capital investment in, or redemption of any stock of, such limited profit housing sponsor in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.</p><p>4. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the housing sponsor and other parties related to the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such housing sponsor and its partners, principals or stockholders to limitations established by HDA as to rentals and other charges, profits, fees, the use and disposition of the real property constituting the site of or relating to the housing development or multifamily residential housing and other property of such housing sponsor, and the use and disposition of franchises of such housing sponsor to the extent more restrictive limitations are not provided by the law under which such housing sponsor is incorporated or organized.</p><p>5. As a condition of any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA shall have the power to supervise the housing sponsor in accordance with the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.34:1/'>36-55.34:1</a> at all times during which such HDA mortgage loan is outstanding and thereafter as necessary to preserve the federal tax exemption of the notes or bonds issued by HDA to finance such HDA mortgage loan.</p><p>C. Mortgage loans made by HDA to persons and families of low and moderate income to finance the purchase or refinancing of single-family residential housing, pursuant to subdivision (11) of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.31/'>36-55.31</a>, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:</p><p>1. The amount disbursed with respect to such HDA mortgage loan shall not exceed 100 percent of the sales price or market value of the single-family residential housing, as determined or approved by or on behalf of HDA. HDA may also disburse additional amounts to finance such closing costs and fees as it may deem necessary or appropriate, and all such disbursements and financings of closing costs and fees subsequent to the enactment of this chapter are hereby validated. The amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years. If during the term of the HDA mortgage loan (i) the outstanding principal balance of the HDA mortgage loan is expected to increase to an amount in excess of the original principal balance or (ii) the amount of monthly payments on the HDA mortgage loan will or may be adjusted, HDA shall so notify the applicants prior to the execution of the HDA mortgage loan. Such notice shall describe the terms and conditions under which the outstanding principal balance or the amount of monthly payments, or both, may be so increased or adjusted, and such notice shall be signed by the applicants.</p><p>2. Such an HDA mortgage loan shall be made only after a determination that such a mortgage loan is not otherwise available from private lenders upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions, and the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan shall contain such a determination.</p><p>3. The instrument evidencing any such HDA mortgage loan and the mortgage securing any such HDA mortgage loan shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed or approved by HDA. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the person or family of low or moderate income to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such person or family of low or moderate income relating to the use, occupancy, maintenance and sale of the single-family residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan and the payment, prepayment and assignment of such HDA mortgage loan.</p><p>D. Mortgage loans made by HDA to housing sponsors or persons or families of low or moderate income to finance the construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement of housing developments or residential housing intended, upon completion of such construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement, for ownership or occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income, pursuant to subdivision (12) of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.31/'>36-55.31</a> of this chapter, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:</p><p>1. The amount disbursed with respect to such an HDA mortgage loan to a limited profit housing sponsor shall not exceed 95 percent of the total housing development costs and to a nonprofit housing sponsor or a person or family of low or moderate income shall not exceed 100 percent of the total housing development costs. Subsequent to the disbursement of such amount, additional amounts may be from time to time disbursed if the sum of the amount to be so disbursed and the then outstanding principal balance of the HDA mortgage loan does not exceed 95 percent of the market value of the housing development or residential housing as then determined by the Authority. Without regard as to whether HDA intends to remain the lender in respect to such mortgage loan throughout the amortization period thereof, the amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.</p><p>2. In considering any application for such an HDA mortgage loan, HDA shall give first priority to applications relating to housing developments or residential housing which are or will be well-planned and well-designed, and also shall give consideration to:</p><p>a. The comparative need for housing for persons and families of low and moderate income in the area proposed to be served by the housing development or residential housing;</p><p>b. The ability of the applicant to construct, rehabilitate or improve and market or operate, manage and maintain the housing development or residential housing;</p><p>c. The existence of zoning or other regulations to protect adequately the housing development or residential housing against detrimental future uses which could cause undue depreciation in the value of the housing development or residential housing;</p><p>d. The availability of adequate parks, recreational areas, utilities, schools, transportation and parking; and</p><p>e. The existence of statewide housing plans.</p><p>3. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, HDA may require the housing sponsor, person or family of low or moderate income, contractors, architects, marketing agents, management agents and other parties related to the housing development or residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan to execute such agreements, assurances, guarantees and certifications as HDA shall determine to be necessary including, without limitation, agreements between HDA and such housing sponsor and its partners, principals or stockholders or such person or family of low or moderate income to limitations established by HDA as to rentals and other charges, profits, fees, the use and disposition of the real property constituting the site of or relating to the housing development or residential housing and other property of such housing sponsor, and the use and disposition of franchises of such housing sponsor to the extent more restrictive limitations are not provided by the law under which such housing sponsor is incorporated or organized. HDA shall require the housing sponsor or person or family of low or moderate income receiving such HDA mortgage loan, or the construction contractor, or both, to furnish such assurances of completion of the construction, rehabilitation or improvement as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for, such mortgage loan.</p><p>4. As a condition of any such HDA mortgage loan to a housing sponsor, HDA shall have the power to supervise such housing sponsor in accordance with the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.34:1/'>36-55.34:1</a> at all times during which such HDA mortgage loan is outstanding and thereafter as necessary to preserve the federal tax exemption of the notes or bonds issued by HDA to finance such HDA mortgage loan.</p><p>5. With respect to any such HDA mortgage loan, the provisions of subdivisions 2 and 3 of subsection B of this section shall be applicable.</p><p>E. Mortgage loans made by HDA pursuant to subdivision 13 of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.31/'>36-55.31</a> to finance the construction, rehabilitation, preservation or improvement, or ownership and operation, of economically mixed projects or portions thereof and, if any such project is within a revitalization area designated in or pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.30:2/'>36-55.30:2</a>, any nonhousing buildings that are incidental to such project or are determined by such governing body of the city or county to be necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such area or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such area shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to those contained in subsection A of this section:</p><p>1. The principal amount of such an HDA mortgage loan shall not exceed 95 percent of the total housing development costs, and the amortization period of such an HDA mortgage loan shall be as determined by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or in the commitment for, such mortgage loan; but in no event shall such amortization period exceed 50 years.</p><p>2. Such an HDA mortgage loan shall be made only if the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.30:2/'>36-55.30:2</a> are satisfied.</p><p>3. The instrument evidencing any such HDA mortgage loan and the mortgage securing any such HDA mortgage loan shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed or approved by HDA. The aforesaid mortgage and instrument evidencing an HDA mortgage loan may contain exculpatory provisions relieving a housing sponsor, if any, or its principal or principals from personal liability if deemed desirable by HDA.</p><p>4. The nonhousing buildings shall be financed by such an HDA mortgage loan only if the HDA shall receive a certification from the housing sponsor that a mortgage loan for the financing of such nonhousing buildings is not otherwise available from private lenders upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions.</p><p>1975, c. 536; 1979, c. 374; 1982, c. 176; 1987, c. 164; 1988, c. 556; 1989, c. 161; 1991, c. 447; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0187'>187</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

HDA shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to purchase, acquire, construct, rehabilitate, own, operate, improve, repair, maintain, encumber, mortgage, lease, sell and transfer or otherwise dispose of multi-family residential housing or any part or interest therein for occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income. For the purposes of this section, HDA may form corporations, joint ventures, partnerships, trusts or other legal entities or any combination thereof, on its own behalf or in conjunction with individuals or other public or private entities, to serve as housing sponsors for multi-family residential housing developments; may acquire, own, encumber, pledge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of interests in such housing sponsors; may provide financing and other funding to such housing sponsors; and may exercise all necessary or convenient rights and powers and perform all requisite duties and obligations relating thereto. HDA shall not exercise the powers granted under this section with respect to any multi-family residential housing development, unless HDA makes the following findings:</p><p>1. That there exists a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing at rentals or prices which persons and families of low income or moderate income can afford within the general housing market area to be served by the proposed housing development.</p><p>2. That private enterprise and investment have been unable, without assistance, to provide the needed decent, safe and sanitary housing at rentals or prices which persons or families of low and moderate income can afford.</p><p>3. That private sponsors would not be willing, without assistance, to undertake the proposed housing development upon substantially similar terms and conditions.</p><p>4. That HDA has not received notification from both the local housing authority having jurisdiction over the area in which the housing development would be located and the sponsor of such development that it is the preference of both parties that the local housing authority undertake the proposed housing development.</p><p>5. That the proposed housing development will provide well-planned, well-designed housing for persons or families of low and moderate income.</p><p>6. That the housing development will be of public use and will provide a public benefit.</p><p>7. That the housing development will be undertaken within the authority conferred by this chapter upon HDA.</p><p>B. HDA shall also find, in connection with the new construction or substantial rehabilitation by HDA of any proposed multi-family residential housing development, that the governing body of the locality in which such housing development is to be located has not, within sixty days after written notification of such proposed construction or substantial rehabilitation has been sent by HDA to such governing body and to any local housing authority having jurisdiction in such locality, certified to HDA in writing its disapproval of the proposed multi-family residential housing development. The foregoing notwithstanding, no such finding need be made if HDA has received from the governing body its certified resolution approving the proposed housing development.</p><p>C. At least sixty days prior to purchasing, acquiring, constructing or rehabilitating any multi-family residential housing development pursuant to this section, HDA shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality in which such development is to be located. Such notice (i) shall state that HDA intends to purchase, acquire, construct or rehabilitate a multi-family residential housing development or developments in such locality and shall solicit proposals from interested parties for such purchase, acquisition, construction or rehabilitation or (ii) shall identify the multi-family residential housing development or developments to be purchased, acquired, constructed or rehabilitated and shall request comments from the general public with respect to such proposed purchase, acquisition, construction or rehabilitation.</p><p>D. In the event HDA or any legal entity formed by HDA is to construct or rehabilitate a multi-family residential housing development pursuant to this section, HDA or such legal entity shall contract with a private firm for the performance of such construction and rehabilitation, unless HDA determines that no responsible private firm would be willing and able to contract for such construction or rehabilitation at a price necessary for the financial feasibility of such development. HDA or any legal entity formed by HDA shall contract with a private firm or public body for the performance of management services for any multi-family residential housing development owned by HDA or such legal entity pursuant to this section, unless HDA determines that no responsible private firm and no public body would be willing and able to contract for the performance of such management services at a price necessary for the financial feasibility of such development. For the purpose of this subsection, the term \"private firm\" shall include an individual, joint venture, partnership, stock corporation, trust or other similar business entity legally authorized to perform the construction, rehabilitation or management, as may be applicable, of the proposed multi-family residential housing development.</p><p>1987, c. 254; 1991, c. 206; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0298'>298</a>.</p>"

Except in the case of a mortgage loan that, when made by the mortgage lender, is to be purchased by HDA, no obligation shall be eligible for purchase or commitment to purchase by HDA from a mortgage lender hereunder if the date of said obligation precedes the date of HDA's commitment to purchase such obligation by such number of years as shall be determined by HDA and unless at or before the time of transfer thereof to HDA such mortgage lender certifies:</p><p>1. That in its judgment the loan would in all respects be a prudent investment; and</p><p>2. That the proceeds of sale or its equivalent shall be reinvested as provided in subsection F of this section, or invested in short-term obligations pending such reinvestment. However, certification pursuant to this subsection shall not be required in the case of the purchase or commitment to purchase by HDA of a mortgage loan held, insured or assisted by the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof.</p><p>B. HDA shall purchase mortgage loans at a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal balance; however, discount from the principal balance or the payment of a premium may be employed to effect a fair rate of return which in the opinion of HDA is consistent with the obligations of the HDA hereunder and the purposes of this chapter. In addition to the aforesaid payment of outstanding principal balance HDA shall pay the accrued interest due thereon, on the date the loan or obligation is delivered against payment therefor. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the purchase by HDA of a mortgage loan held, insured or assisted by the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in which case the purchase price shall be determined by agreement of HDA and the mortgage lender.</p><p>C. Loans purchased or sold hereunder may include but shall not be limited to loans which are insured, guaranteed or assisted by the federal government or for which there is a commitment by the federal government to insure, guarantee or assist such loan.</p><p>D. HDA shall from time to time adopt, modify or repeal rules and regulations governing the making of loans to mortgage lenders and the purchase and sale of mortgage loans and the application of the proceeds thereof, including rules and regulations as to any or all of the following:</p><p>1. Procedures for the submission of requests or the invitation of proposals for the purchase and sale of mortgage loans or for loans to mortgage lenders;</p><p>2. Limitations or restrictions as to number of family units, location or other qualifications or characteristics of residences to be financed by residential mortgage loans and requirements as to the income limits of persons and families of low and moderate income occupying such residences;</p><p>3. Restrictions as to the interest rates on residential mortgage loans or the return realized therefrom by mortgage lenders;</p><p>4. Requirements as to commitments by mortgage lenders with respect to residential mortgage loans;</p><p>5. Schedules of any fees and charges necessary to provide for expenses and reserves of the HDA; and</p><p>6. Any other matters related to the duties and the exercise of the powers of HDA to purchase and sell mortgage loans or to make mortgage loans or other loans to mortgage lenders.</p><p>Such rules and regulations shall be designed to effectuate the general purposes of this chapter and the following specific objectives: (i) the expansion of the supply of funds in the Commonwealth available for residential mortgage loans; (ii) the provision of the additional housing needed to remedy the shortage of adequate housing in the Commonwealth and eliminate the existence of a large number of substandard dwellings; and (iii) the restriction of the financial return and benefit to that necessary to protect against the realization by mortgage lenders of an excessive financial return or benefit as determined by prevailing market conditions.</p><p>E. The interest rate or rates and other terms of the loans to mortgage lenders made from the proceeds of any issue of bonds of the HDA shall be at least sufficient so as to assure the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due from the amounts received by HDA in repayment of such loans and interest thereon.</p><p>F. HDA shall require as a condition of each loan to a mortgage lender and as a condition of the purchase or the making of a commitment to purchase mortgage loans from a mortgage lender that such mortgage lender within such period of time following the receipt of the proceeds as shall be prescribed by rules and regulations of HDA, shall have entered into written commitments to make, and shall thereafter proceed as promptly as practicable to make and disburse from such proceeds, residential mortgage loans in the Commonwealth of Virginia having a stated maturity of not less than twenty years from the date thereof in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of such proceeds. HDA shall not purchase nor make commitment to purchase mortgage loans or obligations from a mortgage lender from which it has previously purchased mortgage loans nor make a loan to a mortgage lender to which it has previously made a loan unless said mortgage lender has either restored or made commitments to restore to its portfolio of residential mortgage loans in the Commonwealth of Virginia, residential mortgage loans having a stated maturity of not less than twenty years from the date thereof in an aggregate principal amount equal to either the proceeds of prior sale or the amount of prior loan to said mortgage lender.

        "Body": "<p>(1) For mortgage payments to be eligible for insurance under the provisions of this chapter, the underlying mortgage loan shall: (a) be one which is made to and held by a mortgagee approved by HDA as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly; (b) not exceed (i) 100% of the estimated cost of such proposed housing development if owned or to be owned by a nonprofit mortgagor or if owned by a person or family of low or moderate income, in the case of a single-family dwelling or condominium; or, (ii) 95% of the estimated cost of the proposed housing development if owned or to be owned by any other mortgagor; (c) have a maturity satisfactory to HDA but in no case longer than 80% of HDA's estimate of the remaining useful life of said housing or 40 years from the date of the issuance of insurance, whichever is earlier; (d) contain amortization provisions satisfactory to HDA requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by HDA; (e) be in such form and contain such terms and provisions with respect to maturity, property insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes and assessments, default reserves, delinquency charges, default remedies, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, equitable and legal redemption rights, prepayment privileges and other matters as HDA may prescribe.</p><p>(2) All applications for mortgage insurance shall be forwarded, together with an application fee prescribed by HDA, to the executive director of HDA. HDA shall cause an investigation of the proposed housing to be made, review the application and the report of the investigation, and approve or deny the application. No application shall be approved unless HDA finds that it is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and further finds that the financing plan for the proposed housing is sound. HDA shall notify the applicant and the proposed lender of its decision. Any such approval shall be conditioned upon payment to HDA, within such reasonable time and after notification of approval as may be specified by HDA, of the commitment fee prescribed by HDA.</p><p>(3) HDA shall fix mortgage insurance premiums for the insurance of mortgage payments under the provisions of this chapter. Such premiums shall be computed as a percentage of the principal of the mortgage outstanding at the beginning of each mortgage year, but shall not be more than one-half of one per centum per year of such principal amount. The amount of premium need not be uniform for all insured loans. Such premiums shall be payable by mortgagors or mortgagees in such manner as prescribed by HDA.</p><p>(4) In the event of default by the mortgagor, the mortgagee shall notify HDA both of the default and the mortgagee's proposed course of action. When it appears feasible, HDA may for a temporary period upon default or threatened default by the mortgagor authorize mortgage payments to be made by HDA to the mortgagee which payments shall be repaid under such conditions as HDA may prescribe. HDA may also agree to revised terms of financing when such appear prudent. The mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance provided herein upon: (a) Any sale of the mortgaged property by court order in foreclosure or a sale with the consent of HDA by the mortgagor or a subsequent owner of the property or by the mortgagee after foreclosure or acquisition by deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising from the mortgage, foreclosure, or any deficiency judgment shall be assigned to HDA without recourse except such claims as may have been released with the consent of HDA; or (b) the expiration of six months after the mortgagee has taken title to the mortgaged property under judgment of strict foreclosure, foreclosure by sale or other judicial sale, or under a deed in lieu of foreclosure if during such period the mortgagee has made a bona fide attempt to sell the property, and thereafter conveys the property to HDA with an assignment, without recourse, to HDA of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising out of the mortgage foreclosure, or deficiency judgment; or (c) the acceptance by HDA of title to the property or an assignment of the mortgage, without recourse to HDA, in the event HDA determines it imprudent to proceed under (a) or (b) above. Upon the occurrence of either (a), (b) or (c) hereof, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay premium charges for insurance shall cease, and HDA shall, within thirty days thereafter, pay to the mortgagee ninety-eight percent of the sum of (i) the then unpaid principal balance of the insured indebtedness, (ii) the unpaid interest to the date of conveyance or assignment to HDA, as the case may be, (iii) the amount of all payments made by the mortgagee for which it has not been reimbursed for taxes, insurance, assessments and mortgage insurance premiums, and (iv) such other necessary fees, costs or expenses of the mortgagee as may be approved by HDA.</p><p>(5) Upon request of the mortgagee, HDA may at any time, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability or consent to the release of parts of the property from the lien of the mortgage, or approve a substitute mortgagor or sale of the property or part thereof.</p><p>(6) No claim for the benefit of the insurance provided in this chapter shall be accepted by HDA except within one year after any sale or acquisition of title of the mortgaged premises described in subdivision (a) or (b) of subsection (4) of this section.</p><p>1972, c. 830; 1975, c. 536.</p>"

For purposes of this section, \"diligent effort\" means a good faith search by HDA for mortgage guaranty insurance among admitted insurers resulting in declinations of coverage, by three unaffiliated insurers licensed and authorized in this Commonwealth to write the mortgage guaranty insurance coverage sought, at a premium equal to or less than the premium in force for the loans made or financed by HDA. HDA may provide financing and other funding to any such fund or corporation and may exercise all necessary or convenient rights and powers and perform all requisite duties and obligations relating thereto. Any such fund or corporation shall be subject to the direction and control of the commissioners of HDA and shall have such powers and duties as the commissioners of HDA shall prescribe. Any such fund or corporation may charge such premiums and may establish such reserves as HDA shall specify. HDA may specify that any such reserves shall be assets of such fund or corporation and shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of HDA. Any such fund or corporation, its directors, officers and employees, its assets and operations, and its policies of insurance and the premiums therefor shall not be subject to the provisions of Title 38.2 and rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. The property of any such fund or corporation and its income and operations shall be exempt from taxation or assessments of every kind by the Commonwealth and all municipalities and other political subdivisions thereof.

Defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the obligations and duties of HDA to the holders of the notes or bonds and providing for the rights and remedies of the holders of the notes or bonds in the event of such default, including as a matter of right the appointment of a receiver; provided, however, that such rights and remedies shall not be inconsistent with the general laws of the Commonwealth and the other provisions of this chapter;</p><p>11.

Any pledge made by HDA shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; HDA's interest, then existing or thereafter obtained, in the revenues, moneys, mortgage loans, receivables, contract rights or other property or proceeds so pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against HDA, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded, nor shall any filing be required with respect thereto.</p><p>E. Neither the commissioners of HDA nor any other person executing such notes or bonds shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.</p><p>F. HDA, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist, shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase notes or bonds of HDA, which shall thereupon be cancelled unless HDA shall provide written notification to the trustee pursuant to subsection J, at a price not exceeding:</p><p>1.

If the notes or bonds are not then redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after such purchase upon which the notes or bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to such date.</p><p>G. In the discretion of HDA, the bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between HDA and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of HDA in relation to the exercise of its corporate powers and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. HDA may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of HDA. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.</p><p>H. Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.</p><p>I. In case any of the commissioners or officers of HDA whose signatures appear on any notes or bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such notes or bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery.</p><p>J. Notwithstanding any statute or case law to the contrary, the purchase or actual or constructive ownership by HDA of any of its notes or bonds with the intent that such notes or bonds remain outstanding, as evidenced by written notification from HDA to the trustee under the resolution or trust indenture, shall not cause such notes or bonds or the indebtedness evidenced thereby to be canceled or extinguished, subject to such terms and conditions as may be set forth in the written notification and except as may be otherwise provided in the resolution or trust indenture.</p><p>1972, c. 830; 1978, c. 189; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0298'>298</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0442'>442</a>.</p>"

        "Title": "Reserve funds and appropriations.",
        "Body": "<p>A. 1. HDA may create and establish one or more special funds (herein referred to as \"capital reserve funds\"), and shall pay into each such capital reserve fund (i) any moneys appropriated and made available by the Commonwealth for the purpose of such fund, (ii) any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of HDA authorizing the issuance thereof, and (iii) any other moneys which may be made available to HDA for the purpose of such fund from any other source or sources. All moneys held in any capital reserve fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used, as required, solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund or of the sinking fund payments hereinafter mentioned with respect to such bonds, the purchase or redemption of such bonds, the payment of interest on such bonds or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; however, if moneys in any such fund at any time are less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement established for such fund as hereinafter provided, HDA shall not use such moneys for any optional purchase or redemption of such bonds. Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, any capital reserve fund due to the investment thereof may be transferred by HDA to other funds or accounts of HDA to the extent it does not reduce the amount of such capital reserve fund below the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund;</p><p>2. HDA shall not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a capital reserve fund, if upon the issuance of such bonds, the amount of such capital reserve fund will be less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement of such fund, unless HDA, at the time of issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, will not be less than the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. For purposes of this section, the term \"minimum capital reserve fund requirement\" shall mean, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money, as provided in the resolutions of HDA authorizing the bonds with respect to which such fund is established, equal to not more than the greatest of the respective amounts, for the current or any future fiscal year of HDA, of annual debt service on the bonds of HDA secured in whole or in part by such fund, such annual debt service for any fiscal year being the amount of money equal to the aggregate of (i) all interest payable during such fiscal year on all bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund outstanding on the date of computation, plus (ii) the principal amount of all such bonds outstanding on said date of computation which mature during such fiscal year, plus (iii) all amounts specified in any resolution of the authority authorizing any of such bonds as payable during such fiscal year as a sinking fund payment with respect to any of such bonds which mature after such fiscal year, all calculated on the assumption that such bonds will after said date of computation cease to be outstanding by reason, but only by reason, of the payment of bonds when due, and the payment when due and application in accordance with the resolution authorizing those bonds, of all of such sinking fund payments payable at or after said date of computation; however, in computing the annual debt service for any fiscal year as aforesaid, bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with the defeasance provisions of the resolution or resolutions of HDA authorizing the issuance thereof shall not be included in bonds outstanding on the date of computation aforesaid;</p><p>3. In computing the amount of any capital reserve funds for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of such funds shall be invested shall be valued at par or if purchased at less than par, at their cost to HDA;</p><p>4. To assure the continued operation and solvency of HDA for the carrying out of its corporate purposes, provision is made in subdivision 1 of this subsection for the accumulation in each capital reserve fund of an amount equal to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund.</p><p>B. In order further to assure the maintenance of the foregoing capital reserve funds, the chairman of HDA shall annually, on or before December 1, make and deliver to the Governor and Director of the Budget his certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore each such capital reserve fund to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. Within five days after the beginning of each session of the General Assembly, the Governor shall submit to the presiding officer of each house printed copies of a budget including the sum, if any, required to restore each such capital reserve fund to the minimum capital reserve fund requirement for such fund. All sums appropriated by the legislature for such restoration and paid shall be deposited by HDA in the applicable capital reserve fund.</p><p>C. HDA shall create and establish such other fund or funds as may be necessary or desirable for its corporate purposes.</p><p>D. All amounts paid over to HDA by the Commonwealth pursuant to the provisions of this section shall constitute and be accounted for as advances by the Commonwealth to HDA and, subject to the rights of the holders of any bonds or notes of HDA theretofore or thereafter issued, shall be repaid to the Commonwealth without interest from all available operating revenues of HDA in excess of amounts required for the payment of bonds, notes or other obligations of HDA, the capital reserve funds and operating expenses.</p><p>E. The outstanding principal amount of notes and bonds issued by HDA secured by capital reserve funds pursuant to this section, other than notes and bonds for which refunding obligations shall have been issued pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/36-55.42/'>36-55.42</a>, shall not exceed $1.5 billion. For the purpose of this subdivision, the outstanding principal amount of notes or bonds issued by HDA at a price less than the face amount thereof shall be deemed to be the issue price of such notes or bonds.</p><p>1972, c. 830; 1974, c. 263; 1987, c. 451; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0378'>378</a>; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0041'>41</a>.</p>"

In the case of the sale of any single-family house by a private individual-owner not residing in the house at the time of the sale or who was not the most recent resident of the house prior to sale, the exemption granted shall apply only with respect to one such sale within any 24-month period, provided that such bona fide private individual owner does not own any interest in, nor is there owned or reserved on his behalf, under any express or voluntary agreement, title to or any right to all or a portion of the proceeds from the sale or rental of, more than three such single-family houses at any one time. The sale or rental of any such single-family house shall be exempt from the application of this chapter only if the house is sold or rented (i) without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, salesperson, or of the facilities or the services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings, or of any employee, independent contractor, or agent of any broker, agent, salesperson, or person and (ii) without the publication, posting, or mailing, after notice, of any advertisement or written notice in violation of this chapter. However, nothing herein shall prohibit the use of attorneys, escrow agents, abstractors, title companies, and other professional assistance as necessary to perfect or transfer the title. This exemption shall not apply to or inure to the benefit of any licensee of the Real Estate Board or regulant of the Fair Housing Board, regardless of whether the licensee is acting in his personal or professional capacity.</p><p>B. Except for subdivision A 3 of § <a href='/vacode/36-96.3/'>36-96.3</a>, this chapter shall not apply to rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.</p><p>C. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a religious organization, association or society, or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised, or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society, from limiting the sale, rental, or occupancy of dwellings that it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose to persons of the same religion, or from giving preferences to such persons, unless membership in such religion is restricted on account of race, color, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability. Nor shall anything in this chapter apply to a private membership club not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodging that it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodgings to its members or from giving preference to its members. Nor, where matters of personal privacy are involved, shall anything in this chapter be construed to prohibit any private, state-owned, or state-supported educational institution, hospital, nursing home, or religious or correctional institution from requiring that persons of both sexes not occupy any single-family residence or room or unit of dwellings or other buildings, or restrooms in such room or unit in dwellings or other buildings, which it owns or operates.</p><p>D. Nothing in this chapter prohibits conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined in federal law.</p><p>E.

The owner or managing agent may collect from the applicant moneys to reimburse the owner or managing agent for the exact amount of the out-of-pocket costs for such criminal record checks. Nothing in this chapter shall require an owner or managing agent to rent a dwelling to an individual who, based on a prior record of criminal convictions involving harm to persons or property, would constitute a clear and present threat to the health or safety of other individuals.</p><p>G. Nothing in this chapter limits the applicability of any reasonable local, state or federal restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Owners or managing agents of dwellings may develop and implement reasonable occupancy and safety standards based on factors such as the number and size of sleeping areas or bedrooms and overall size of a dwelling unit so long as the standards do not violate local, state or federal restrictions. Nothing in this chapter prohibits the rental application or similar document from requiring information concerning the number, ages, sex and familial relationship of the applicants and the dwelling's intended occupants.</p><p>H. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a landlord from considering evidence of an applicant's status as a victim of family abuse, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/16.1-228/'>16.1-228</a>, to mitigate any adverse effect of an otherwise qualified applicant's application pursuant to subsection D of § <a href='/vacode/55.1-1203/'>55.1-1203</a>.</p><p>I.

However, if an owner, whether individually or through a business entity, owns more than a 10 percent interest in more than four rental dwelling units in the Commonwealth at the time of the alleged discriminatory housing practice, the exemption provided in this subsection shall not apply.</p><p>J.

Discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in the connection therewith to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, source of funds, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or military status;</p><p>3. Make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability. The use of words or symbols associated with a particular religion, national origin, sex, or race shall be prima facie evidence of an illegal preference under this chapter that shall not be overcome by a general disclaimer. However, reference alone to places of worship, including churches, synagogues, temples, or mosques, in any such notice, statement, or advertisement shall not be prima facie evidence of an illegal preference;</p><p>4. Represent to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available;</p><p>5. Deny any person access to membership in or participation in any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization, or other service, organization, or facility relating to the business of selling or renting dwellings or discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or participation because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability;</p><p>6. Include in any transfer, sale, rental, or lease of housing any restrictive covenant that discriminates because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability or for any person to honor or exercise, or attempt to honor or exercise, any such discriminatory covenant pertaining to housing;</p><p>7. Induce or attempt to induce to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability;</p><p>8. Refuse to sell or rent, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise discriminate or make unavailable or deny a dwelling because of a disability of (i) the buyer or renter; (ii) a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (iii) any person associated with the buyer or renter; or</p><p>9. Discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith because of a disability of (i) that person; (ii) a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it was so sold, rented, or made available; or (iii) any person associated with that buyer or renter.</p><p>B. For the purposes of this section, discrimination includes (i) a refusal to permit, at the expense of the disabled person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by any person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises; except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; (ii) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, practices, policies, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or (iii) in connection with the design and construction of covered multi-family dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct dwellings in such a manner that:</p><p>1. The public use and common use areas of the dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by disabled persons;</p><p>2. All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by disabled persons in wheelchairs; and</p><p>3. All premises within covered multi-family dwelling units contain an accessible route into and through the dwelling; light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls are in accessible locations; there are reinforcements in the bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and there are usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space. As used in this subdivision, the term \"covered multi-family dwellings\" means buildings consisting of four or more units if such buildings have one or more elevators and ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units.</p><p>C. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory housing practice for any political jurisdiction or its employees or appointed commissions to discriminate in the application of local land use ordinances or guidelines, or in the permitting of housing developments, (i) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability; (ii) because the housing development contains or is expected to contain affordable housing units occupied or intended for occupancy by families or individuals with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income of the area where the housing development is located or is proposed to be located; or (iii) by prohibiting or imposing conditions upon the rental or sale of dwelling units, provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit ordinances related to short-term rentals as defined in § <a href='/vacode/15.2-983/'>15.2-983</a>. It shall not be a violation of this chapter if land use decisions or decisions relating to the permitting of housing developments are based upon considerations of limiting high concentrations of affordable housing.</p><p>D. Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standards for Building and Facilities (commonly cited as \"ANSI A117.1\") or with any other standards adopted as part of regulations promulgated by HUD providing accessibility and usability for physically disabled people shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subdivision B 3.</p><p>E.

When a request for a reasonable accommodation may impose either (i) an undue financial and administrative burden or (ii) a fundamental alteration to the nature of the operations of the person receiving the request, the person receiving the request shall offer to engage in a good-faith interactive process to determine if there is an alternative accommodation that would effectively address the disability-related needs of the requester. An interactive process is not required when the requester does not have a disability and a disability-related need for the requested accommodation. As part of the interactive process, unless the reasonableness and necessity for the accommodation has been established by the requester, a request may be made for additional supporting documentation to evaluate the reasonableness of either the requested accommodation or any identified alternative accommodations. If an alternative accommodation is identified that effectively meets the requester's disability-related needs and is reasonable, the person receiving the reasonable accommodation request shall make the effective alternative accommodation. However, the requester shall not be required to accept an alternative accommodation if the requested accommodation is also reasonable. The various factors to be considered for determining whether an accommodation imposes an undue financial and administrative burden include (a) the cost of the requested accommodation, including any substantial increase in the cost of the owner's insurance policy; (b) the financial resources of the person receiving the request; (c) the benefits that the accommodation would provide to the person with a disability; and (d) the availability of alternative accommodations that would effectively meet the requester's disability-related needs.</p><p>D. A request for a reasonable accommodation shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and may be denied if (i) the person on whose behalf the request for an accommodation was submitted is not disabled; (ii) there is no disability-related need for the accommodation; (iii) the accommodation imposes an undue financial and administrative burden on the person receiving the request; or (iv) the accommodation would fundamentally alter the nature of the operations of the person receiving the request. With respect to a request for reasonable accommodation to maintain an assistance animal in a dwelling, the requested assistance animal shall (a) work, provide assistance, or perform tasks or services for the benefit of the requester or (b) provide emotional support that alleviates one or more of the identified symptoms or effects of such requester's existing disability. In addition, as determined by the person receiving the request, the requested assistance animal shall not pose a clear and present threat of substantial harm to others or to the dwelling itself that is not solely based on breed, size, or type or cannot be reduced or eliminated by another reasonable accommodation.</p><p>2017, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0575'>575</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0729'>729</a>; 2021, Sp.

        "Body": "<p>A. It is unlawful for any person or other entity, including any lending institution, whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, or in the manner of providing such a transaction, because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability. It is not unlawful, however, for any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate transactions to require any applicant to qualify financially for the loan or loans for which such person is making application.</p><p>B. As used in this section, the term \"residential real estate-related transaction\" means any of the following:</p><p>1. The making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance (i) for purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling or (ii) secured by residential real estate; or</p><p>2. The selling, brokering, insuring, or appraising of residential real property. However, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a person engaged in the business of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration factors other than race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or disability.</p><p>C. It shall be unlawful for any state, county, city, or municipal treasurer or governmental official whose responsibility it is to account for, to invest, or manage public funds to deposit or cause to be deposited any public funds in any lending institution provided for herein which is found to be committing discriminatory practices, where such findings were upheld by any court of competent jurisdiction. Upon such a court's judicial enforcement of any order to restrain a practice of such lending institution or for said institution to cease or desist in a discriminatory practice, the appropriate fiscal officer or treasurer of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof which has funds deposited in any lending institution which is practicing discrimination, as set forth herein, shall take immediate steps to have the said funds withdrawn and redeposited in another lending institution. If for reasons of sound economic management, this action will result in a financial loss to the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, the action may be deferred for a period not longer than one year. If the lending institution in question has corrected its discriminatory practices, any prohibition set forth in this section shall not apply.</p><p>1972, c. 591, § 36-90; 1973, c. 358; 1989, c. 88; 1991, c. 557; 2020, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1137'>1137</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1140'>1140</a>; 2021, Sp.

The provisions of the Building Code and modifications thereof shall be such as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Commonwealth, provided that buildings and structures should be permitted to be constructed, rehabilitated and maintained at the least possible cost consistent with recognized standards of health, safety, energy conservation and water conservation, including provisions necessary to prevent overcrowding, rodent or insect infestation, and garbage accumulation; and barrier-free provisions for the physically handicapped and aged. Such regulations shall be reasonable and appropriate to the objectives of this chapter.</p><p>B.

Where practical, the Code provisions shall be stated in terms of required level of performance, so as to facilitate the prompt acceptance of new building materials and methods. When generally recognized standards of performance are not available, such provisions shall provide for acceptance of materials and methods whose performance has been found by the local building department, on the basis of reliable test and evaluation data, presented by the proponent, to be substantially equal in safety to those specified.</p><p>D. The Board, upon a finding that sufficient allegations exist regarding failures noted in several localities of performance standards by either building materials, methods, or design, may conduct hearings on such allegations if it determines that such alleged failures, if proven, would have an adverse impact on the health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. After at least 21 days' written notice, the Board shall convene a hearing to consider such allegations. Such notice shall be given to the known manufacturers of the subject building material and as many other interested parties, industry representatives, and trade groups as can reasonably be identified. Following the hearing, the Board, upon finding that (i) the current technical or administrative Code provisions allow use of or result in defective or deficient building materials, methods, or designs, and (ii) immediate action is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth, may issue amended regulations establishing interim performance standards and Code provisions for the installation, application, and use of such building materials, methods or designs in the Commonwealth. Such amended regulations shall become effective upon their publication in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Any amendments to regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective upon their publication in the Virginia Register of Regulations and shall be effective for a period of 24 months or until adopted, modified, or repealed by the Board.</p><p>1972, c. 829; 1974, c. 433; 1975, c. 394; 1977, cc. 423, 613; 1978, c. 581; 1981, c. 2; 1982, c. 267; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0755'>755</a>; 2000, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0751'>751</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0555'>555</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0436'>436</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0650'>650</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0901'>901</a>.</p>"

        "Title": "Enforcement of Code; appeals from decisions of local department; inspection of buildings; inspection warrants; inspection of elevators; issuance of permits.",
        "Body": "<p>A. Enforcement generally. Enforcement of the provisions of the Building Code for construction and rehabilitation shall be the responsibility of the local building department. There shall be established within each local building department a local board of Building Code appeals whose composition, duties and responsibilities shall be prescribed in the Building Code. Any person aggrieved by the local building department's application of the Building Code or refusal to grant a modification to the provisions of the Building Code may appeal to the local board of Building Code appeals. No appeal to the State Building Code Technical Review Board shall lie prior to a final determination by the local board of Building Code appeals. Whenever a county or a municipality does not have such a building department or board of Building Code appeals, the local governing body shall enter into an agreement with the local governing body of another county or municipality or with some other agency, or a state agency approved by the Department for such enforcement and appeals resulting therefrom.</p><p>For the purposes of this section, towns with a population of less than 3,500 may elect to administer and enforce the Building Code; however, where the town does not elect to administer and enforce the Building Code, the county in which the town is situated shall administer and enforce the Building Code for the town. In the event that such town is situated in two or more counties, those counties shall administer and enforce the Building Code for that portion of the town situated within their respective boundaries. Additionally, the local governing body of a county or municipality may enter into an agreement with the governing body of another county or municipality for the provision to such county or municipality's local building department of technical assistance with administration and enforcement of the Building Code.</p><p>B. New construction. Any building or structure may be inspected at any time before completion, and shall not be deemed in compliance until approved by the inspecting authority. Where the construction cost is less than $2,500, however, the inspection may, in the discretion of the inspecting authority, be waived. A building official may issue an annual permit for any construction regulated by the Building Code. The building official shall coordinate all reports of inspections for compliance with the Building Code, with inspections of fire and health officials delegated such authority, prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. Fees may be levied by the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such enforcement and appeals. With the exception of the levy imposed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/36-137/'>36-137</a>, any fees levied pursuant to this subsection shall be used only to support the functions of the local building department.</p><p>C. Existing buildings and structures.</p><p>1. Inspections and enforcement of the Building Code. The local governing body may also inspect and enforce the provisions of the Building Code for existing buildings and structures, whether occupied or not. Such inspection and enforcement shall be carried out by an agency or department designated by the local governing body.</p><p>2. Complaints by tenants. However, upon a finding by the local building department, following a complaint by a tenant of a residential dwelling unit that is the subject of such complaint, that there may be a violation of the unsafe structures provisions of the Building Code, the local building department shall enforce such provisions.</p><p>3. Inspection warrants. If the local building department receives a complaint that a violation of the Building Code exists that is an immediate and imminent threat to the health or safety of the owner, tenant, or occupants of any building or structure, or the owner, occupant, or tenant of any nearby building or structure, and the owner, occupant, or tenant of the building or structure that is the subject of the complaint has refused to allow the local building official or his agent to have access to the subject building or structure, the local building official or his agent may make an affidavit under oath before a magistrate or a court of competent jurisdiction and request that the magistrate or court grant the local building official or his agent an inspection warrant to enable the building official or his agent to enter the subject building or structure for the purpose of determining whether violations of the Building Code exist. After issuing a warrant under this section, the magistrate or judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § <a href='/vacode/19.2-54/'>19.2-54</a>. After executing the warrant, the local building official or his agents shall return the warrant to the clerk of the circuit court of the city or county wherein the inspection was made. The local building official or his agent shall make a reasonable effort to obtain consent from the owner, occupant, or tenant of the subject building or structure prior to seeking the issuance of an inspection warrant under this section.</p><p>4. Transfer of ownership. If the local building department has initiated an enforcement action against the owner of a building or structure and such owner subsequently transfers the ownership of the building or structure to an entity in which the owner holds an ownership interest greater than 50 percent, the pending enforcement action shall continue to be enforced against the owner.</p><p>5. Elevator, escalator, or related conveyance inspections. The local governing body shall, however, inspect and enforce the Building Code for elevators, escalators, or related conveyances, except for elevators in single- and two-family homes and townhouses. Such inspection shall be carried out by an agency or department designated by the local governing body.</p><p>6. A locality may require by ordinance that any landmark, building or structure that contributes to a district delineated pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2306/'>15.2-2306</a> shall not be razed, demolished or moved until the razing, demolition or moving thereof is approved by the review board, or, on appeal, by the governing body after consultation with the review board unless the local maintenance code official consistent with the Uniform Statewide Building Code, Part III Maintenance, determines that it constitutes such a hazard that it shall be razed, demolished or moved.</p><p>For the purpose of this subdivision, a contributing landmark, building or structure is one that adds to or is consistent with the historic or architectural qualities, historic associations, or values for which the district was established pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/15.2-2306/'>15.2-2306</a>, because it (i) was present during the period of significance, (ii) relates to the documented significance of the district, and (iii) possesses historic integrity or is capable of yielding important information about the period.</p><p>7. Fees may be levied by the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such enforcement and appeals. For purposes of this section, \"defray the cost\" may include the fair and reasonable costs incurred for such enforcement during normal business hours, but shall not include overtime costs unless conducted outside of the normal working hours established by the locality. A schedule of such costs shall be adopted by the local governing body in a local ordinance. A locality shall not charge an overtime rate for inspections conducted during the normal business hours established by the locality. With the exception of the levy imposed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/36-137/'>36-137</a>, any fees levied pursuant to this subdivision shall be used only to support the functions of the local building department. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a private entity from conducting such inspections, provided the private entity has been approved to perform such inspections in accordance with the written policy of the maintenance code official for the locality.</p><p>D. Issuance of permits.</p><p>1. Fees may be levied by the local governing body to be paid by the applicant for the issuance of a building permit as otherwise provided under this chapter; however, notwithstanding any provision of law, general or special, if the applicant for a building permit is a tenant or the owner of an easement on the owner's property, such applicant shall not be denied a permit under the Building Code solely upon the basis that the property owner has financial obligations to the locality that constitute a lien on such property in favor of the locality. If such applicant is the property owner, in addition to payment of the fees for issuance of a building permit, the locality may require full payment of any and all financial obligations of the property owner to the locality to satisfy such lien prior to issuance of such permit. For purposes of this subdivision, \"property owner\" means the owner of such property as reflected in the land records of the circuit court clerk where the property is located, the owner's agent, or any entity in which the owner holds an ownership interest greater than 50 percent.</p><p>2. In the event that a local building department denies an application for the issuance of a building permit, the local building department shall provide to the applicant a written explanation detailing the reasons for which the application was denied. The applicant may submit a revised application addressing the reasons for which the application was previously denied, and if the applicant does so, the local building department shall be encouraged, but not required, to limit its review of the revised application to only those portions of the application that were previously deemed inadequate and that the applicant has revised.</p><p>1972, c. 829; 1974, c. 433; 1977, cc. 423, 613; 1978, c. 578; 1981, c. 498; 1982, c. 267; 1992, c. 73; 1993, c. 328; 1994, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0214'>214</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0256'>256</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0574'>574</a>; 1995, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0095'>95</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0523'>523</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0702'>702</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0827'>827</a>; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0333'>333</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0341'>341</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0119'>119</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0720'>720</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0650'>650</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0851'>851</a>; 2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0424'>424</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0291'>291</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0181'>181</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0184'>184</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0551'>551</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0586'>586</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0063'>63</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0494'>494</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0607'>607</a>; 2014, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0354'>354</a>; 2018, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0222'>222</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0698'>698</a>.</p>"

        "Body": "<p>A. For purposes of this section:</p><p>\"Dwelling unit\" means a building or structure or part thereof that is used for a home or residence by one or more persons who maintain a household.</p><p>\"Owner\" means the person shown on the current real estate assessment books or current real estate assessment records.</p><p>\"Residential rental dwelling unit\" means a dwelling unit that is leased or rented to one or more tenants. However, a dwelling unit occupied in part by the owner thereof shall not be construed to be a residential rental dwelling unit unless a tenant occupies a part of the dwelling unit which has its own cooking and sleeping areas, and a bathroom, unless otherwise provided in the zoning ordinance by the local governing body.</p><p>B. Localities may inspect residential rental dwelling units. The local governing body may adopt an ordinance to inspect residential rental dwelling units for compliance with the Building Code and to promote safe, decent and sanitary housing for its citizens, in accordance with the following:</p><p>1. Except as provided in subdivision B 3, the dwelling units shall be located in a rental inspection district established by the local governing body in accordance with this section, and</p><p>2. The rental inspection district is based upon a finding by the local governing body that (i) there is a need to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the occupants of dwelling units inside the designated rental inspection district; (ii) the residential rental dwelling units within the designated rental inspection district are either (a) blighted or in the process of deteriorating, or (b) the residential rental dwelling units are in the need of inspection by the building department to prevent deterioration, taking into account the number, age and condition of residential dwelling rental units inside the proposed rental inspection district; and (iii) the inspection of residential rental dwelling units inside the proposed rental inspection district is necessary to maintain safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for tenants and other residents living in the proposed rental inspection district. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize one or more locality-wide rental inspection districts and a local governing body shall limit the boundaries of the proposed rental inspection districts to such areas of the locality that meet the criteria set out in this subsection, or</p><p>3. An individual residential rental dwelling unit outside of a designated rental inspection district is made subject to the rental inspection ordinance based upon a separate finding for each individual dwelling unit by the local governing body that (i) there is a need to protect the public health, welfare and safety of the occupants of that individual dwelling unit; (ii) the individual dwelling unit is either (a) blighted or (b) in the process of deteriorating; or (iii) there is evidence of violations of the Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for tenants living in such individual dwelling unit.</p><p>For purposes of this section, the local governing body may designate a local government agency other than the building department to perform all or part of the duties contained in the enforcement authority granted to the building department by this section.</p><p>C. 1. Notification to owners of dwelling units. Before adopting a rental inspection ordinance and establishing a rental inspection district or an amendment to either, the governing body of the locality shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance. Notice of the hearing shall be published once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the locality.</p><p>Upon adoption by the local governing body of a rental inspection ordinance, the building department shall make reasonable efforts to notify owners of residential rental dwelling units in the designated rental inspection district, or their designated managing agents, and to any individual dwelling units subject to the rental inspection ordinance, not located in a rental inspection district, of the adoption of such ordinance, and provide information and an explanation of the rental inspection ordinance and the responsibilities of the owner thereunder.</p><p>2. Notification by owners of dwelling units to locality. The rental inspection ordinance may include a provision that requires the owners of dwelling units in a rental inspection district to notify the building department in writing if the dwelling unit of the owner is used for residential rental purposes. The building department may develop a form for such purposes. The rental inspection ordinance shall not include a registration requirement or a fee of any kind associated with the written notification pursuant to this subdivision. A rental inspection ordinance may not require that the written notification from the owner of a dwelling unit subject to a rental inspection ordinance be provided to the building department in less than 60 days after the adoption of a rental inspection ordinance. However, there shall be no penalty for the failure of an owner of a residential rental dwelling unit to comply with the provisions of this subsection, unless and until the building department provides personal or written notice to the property owner, as provided in this section. In any event, the sole penalty for the willful failure of an owner of a dwelling unit who is using the dwelling unit for residential rental purposes to comply with the written notification requirement shall be a civil penalty of up to $50. For purposes of this subsection, notice sent by regular first class mail to the last known address of the owner as shown on the current real estate tax assessment books or current real estate tax assessment records shall be deemed compliance with this requirement.</p><p>D. Initial inspection of dwelling units when rental inspection district is established. Upon establishment of a rental inspection district in accordance with this section, the building department may, in conjunction with the written notifications as provided for in subsection C, proceed to inspect dwelling units in the designated rental inspection district to determine if the dwelling units are being used as a residential rental property and for compliance with the provisions of the Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for the tenants of such property.</p><p>E. Provisions for initial and periodic inspections of multifamily dwelling units. If a multifamily development has more than 10 dwelling units, in the initial and periodic inspections, the building department shall inspect only a sampling of dwelling units, of not less than two and not more than 10 percent of the dwelling units, of a multifamily development, which includes all of the multifamily buildings which are part of that multifamily development. In no event, however, shall the building department charge a fee authorized by this section for inspection of more than 10 dwelling units. If the building department determines upon inspection of the sampling of dwelling units that there are violations of the Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for the tenants of such multifamily development, the building department may inspect as many dwelling units as necessary to enforce the Building Code, in which case, the fee shall be based upon a charge per dwelling unit inspected, as otherwise provided in subsection H.</p><p>F. 1. Follow-up inspections. Upon the initial or periodic inspection of a residential rental dwelling unit subject to a rental inspection ordinance, the building department has the authority under the Building Code to require the owner of the dwelling unit to submit to such follow-up inspections of the dwelling unit as the building department deems necessary, until such time as the dwelling unit is brought into compliance with the provisions of the Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for the tenants.</p><p>2. Periodic inspections. Except as provided in subdivision F 1, following the initial inspection of a residential rental dwelling unit subject to a rental inspection ordinance, the building department may inspect any residential rental dwelling unit in a rental inspection district, that is not otherwise exempted in accordance with this section, no more than once each calendar year.</p><p>G. Exemptions from rental inspection ordinance.</p><p>1. Upon the initial or periodic inspection of a residential rental dwelling unit subject to a rental inspection ordinance for compliance with the Building Code, provided that there are no violations of the Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for the tenants of such residential rental dwelling unit, the building department shall provide, to the owner of such residential rental dwelling unit, an exemption from the rental inspection ordinance for a minimum of four years. Upon the sale of a residential rental dwelling unit, the building department may perform a periodic inspection as provided in subdivision F 2, subsequent to such sale. If a residential rental dwelling unit has been issued a certificate of occupancy within the last four years, an exemption shall be granted for a minimum period of four years from the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the building department. If the residential rental dwelling unit becomes in violation of the Building Code during the exemption period, the building department may revoke the exemption previously granted under this section.</p><p>2. The local governing body may exempt a residential rental unit otherwise subject to a rental inspection ordinance provided such unit is managed by (i) any person licensed under the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/54.1-2106.1/'>54.1-2106.1</a>; (ii) any (a) property manager or (b) managing agent of a landlord as defined in § 551-1200; (iii) any owner of a publicly traded entity that manages its own multifamily residential rental units; or (iv) any owner or managing agent who, in the determination of the local governing body, has achieved a satisfactory designation as a professional property manager.</p><p>H. A local governing body may establish a fee schedule for enforcement of the Building Code, which includes a per dwelling unit fee for the initial inspections, follow-up inspections and periodic inspections under this section.</p><p>I. The provisions of this section shall not, in any way, alter the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 12 (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-1200/'>55.1-1200</a> et seq.) or Chapter 14 (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-1400/'>55.1-1400</a> et seq.) of Title 55.1.</p><p>J.

        "Body": "<p>A. It shall be unlawful for any owner or any other person, firm or corporation, on or after the effective date of any Code provisions, to violate any such provisions. Any such violation shall be deemed a misdemeanor and any owner or any other person, firm or corporation convicted of such a violation shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500. In addition, each day the violation continues after conviction or the court-ordered abatement period has expired shall constitute a separate offense. If the violation remains uncorrected at the time of the conviction, the court shall order the violator to abate or remedy the violation in order to comply with the Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator shall abate or remedy the violation within six months of the date of conviction. Each day during which the violation continues after the court-ordered abatement period has ended shall constitute a separate offense. Any person convicted of a second offense committed within less than five years after a first offense under this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500. Any person convicted of a second offense committed within a period of five to 10 years of a first offense under this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $2,500. Any person convicted of a third or subsequent offense involving the same property committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter after having been at least twice previously convicted shall be punished by confinement in jail for not more than 10 days and a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $5,000, either or both. No portion of the fine imposed for such third or subsequent offense committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter shall be suspended.</p><p>B. Violations of any provision of the Building Code, adopted and promulgated pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/36-103/'>36-103</a>, that results in a dwelling not being a safe, decent and sanitary dwelling, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/25.1-400/'>25.1-400</a>, in a locality where the local governing body has taken official action to enforce such provisions, shall be deemed a misdemeanor and any owner or any other person, firm, or corporation convicted of such a violation shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500. In addition, each day the violation continues after conviction or the expiration of the court-ordered abatement period shall constitute a separate offense. If the violation remains uncorrected at the time of the conviction, the court shall order the violator to abate or remedy the violation in order to comply with the Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator shall abate or remedy the violation within six months of the date of conviction. Each day during which the violation continues after the court-ordered abatement period has ended shall constitute a separate offense. Any person convicted of a second offense, committed within less than five years after a first offense under this chapter shall be punished by confinement in jail for not more than five days and a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, either or both. Provided, however, that the provision for confinement in jail shall not be applicable to any person, firm, or corporation, when such violation involves a multiple-family dwelling unit. Any person convicted of a second offense committed within a period of five to 10 years of a first offense under this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $2,500. Any person convicted of a third or subsequent offense involving the same property, committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter after having been at least twice previously convicted, shall be punished by confinement in jail for not more than 10 days and a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $5,000, either or both. No portion of the fine imposed for such third or subsequent offense committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter shall be suspended.</p><p>C. Any locality may adopt an ordinance which establishes a uniform schedule of civil penalties for violations of specified provisions of the Code which are not abated, or otherwise remedied through hazard control, promptly after receipt of notice of violation from the local enforcement officer.</p><p>This schedule of civil penalties shall be uniform for each type of specified violation, and the penalty for any one violation shall be a civil penalty of not more than $100 for the initial summons and not more than $350 for each additional summons. Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more frequently than once in any 10-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $4,000. Designation of a particular Code violation for a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions, and except for any violation resulting in injury to persons, such designation shall preclude the prosecution of a violation as a misdemeanor.</p><p>Any person summoned or issued a ticket for a scheduled violation may make an appearance in person or in writing by mail to the department of finance or the treasurer of the locality prior to the date fixed for trial in court. Any person so appearing may enter a waiver of trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense charged. Such persons shall be informed of their right to stand trial and that a signature to an admission of liability will have the same force and effect as a judgment of court. As a condition of waiver of trial, admission of liability, and payment of a civil penalty, the violator and a representative of the locality shall agree in writing to terms of abatement or remediation of the violation within six months after the date of payment of the civil penalty.</p><p>If a person charged with a scheduled violation does not elect to enter a waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violation authorized by this section, it shall be the burden of the locality to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose.</p><p>If the violation concerns a residential unit, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court shall order the violator to abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation in order to comply with the Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within six months of the date of the assessment of the civil penalty.</p><p>If the violation concerns a nonresidential building or structure, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court may order the violator to abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation in order to comply with the Code. Any such violator so ordered shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within the time specified by the court.</p><p>D. Any owner or any other person, firm or corporation violating any Code provisions relating to lead hazard controls that poses a hazard to the health of pregnant women and children under the age of six years who occupy the premises shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not more than $2,500. If the court convicts pursuant to this subsection and sets a time by which such hazard must be controlled, each day the hazard remains uncontrolled after the time set for the lead hazard control has expired shall constitute a separate violation of the Uniform Statewide Building Code.</p><p>The landlord shall maintain the painted surfaces of the dwelling unit in compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The landlord's failure to do so shall be enforceable in accordance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code and shall entitle the tenant to terminate the rental agreement.</p><p>Termination of the rental agreement or any other action in retaliation against the tenant after written notification of (i) a lead hazard in the dwelling unit or (ii) that a child of the tenant, who is an authorized occupant in the dwelling unit, has an elevated blood lead level, shall constitute retaliatory conduct in violation of § <a href='/vacode/55.1-1258/'>55.1-1258</a>.</p><p>E.

There is hereby created and set apart a special, permanent, perpetual, and nonreverting fund to be known as the Virginia Defective Drywall Correction and Restoration Assistance Fund for the purposes of promoting the correction and restoration of residential property affected by the environmental problems attributable to defective drywall or overcoming obstacles to the remediation of such properties attributable to the real or presumed presence of defective drywall. The Fund shall consist of such sums that may be appropriated to the Fund by the General Assembly, sums from all receipts by the Fund from loans made by it, all income from the investment of moneys held in the Fund, and any other sums designated for deposit to the Fund from any source, public or private, including any federal grants, awards, or other forms of financial assistance received by the Commonwealth.</p><p>B.

The Department of Housing and Community Development shall direct the distribution of loans or grants from the Fund to particular recipients based upon guidelines developed for this purpose. With approval from the Department of Housing and Community Development, the Authority may disperse moneys from the Fund for the payment of reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred in the administration and management of the Fund. The Authority may establish and collect a reasonable fee on outstanding loans for its management services.</p><p>C. All money belonging to the Fund shall be deposited in an account or accounts in banks or trust companies organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or in national banking associations located in Virginia or in savings institutions located in Virginia organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States. The money in these accounts shall be paid by check and signed by the Executive Director of the Authority or other officers or employees designated by the Board of Directors of the Authority. All deposits of money shall, if required by the Authority, be secured in a manner determined by the Authority to be prudent, and all banks, trust companies, and savings institutions are authorized to give security for the deposits. Money in the Fund shall not be commingled with other money of the Authority. Money in the Fund not needed for immediate use or disbursement may be invested or reinvested by the Authority in obligations or securities that are considered lawful investments for public funds under the laws of the Commonwealth. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the Authority upon written request signed by the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development.</p><p>D. The Authority is empowered to collect, or to authorize others to collect on its behalf, amounts due to the Fund under any loan including, if appropriate, taking the action required by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/15.2-2659/'>15.2-2659</a> to obtain payment of any amounts in default. Proceedings to recover amounts due to the Fund may be instituted by the Authority in the name of the Fund in the appropriate circuit court.</p><p>E. The Department of Housing and Community Development may approve grants to local governments for the purposes of promoting the correction or restoration of residential real property and addressing environmental problems or obstacles to the correction or restoration of such properties. The grants may be used to pay the reasonable and necessary costs associated with the remediation of a contaminated property to remove hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or solid wastes or the stabilization or restoration of these structures or the demolition and removal of the existing structures or other work necessary to remediate or reuse the real property. The Department of Housing and Community Development may establish such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate and shall evaluate each grant request in accordance with the guidelines developed for this purpose. The Authority shall disburse grants from the Fund in accordance with a written request from the Department of Housing and Community Development.</p><p>F. The Authority may make loans to local governments, public authorities, corporations, partnerships, or innocent landowners to finance or refinance the cost of any defective drywall restoration or remediation project for the purposes of promoting the restoration and redevelopment of residential real property and addressing real environmental problems or obstacles to reuse of these properties. The loans shall be used to pay the reasonable and necessary costs related to the restoration and redevelopment of residential real property for the remediation of a contaminated property to remove hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or solid wastes; stabilization or restoration of the affected properties; demolition and removal of existing structures; or other work necessary to remediate or reuse the real property.</p><p>The Department of Housing and Community Development shall designate in writing the recipient of each loan, the purposes of the loan, and the amount of each such loan. No loan from the Fund shall exceed the total cost of the project to be financed or the outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness to be refinanced plus reasonable financing expenses.</p><p>G. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Authority shall determine the interest rate and terms and conditions of any loan from the Fund, which may vary between local governments. Each loan shall be evidenced by appropriate bonds or notes of the loan recipient payable to the Fund. The bonds or notes shall have been duly authorized by the local government and executed by its authorized legal representatives. The Authority is authorized to require in connection with any loan from the Fund such documents, instruments, certificates, legal opinions, and other information as it may deem necessary or convenient. In addition to any other terms or conditions that the Authority may establish, the Authority may require, as a condition to making any loan from the Fund, that the entity receiving the loan covenant and perform any of the following:</p><p>1. Establish and collect rents, rates, fees, taxes, and charges to produce revenue sufficient to pay all or a specified portion of (i) the costs of the project, (ii) any outstanding indebtedness incurred for the purposes of the project, including the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the loan from the Fund to the local government, and (iii) any amounts necessary to create and maintain any required reserve.</p><p>2. Levy and collect ad valorem taxes on all property within the jurisdiction of the local government subject to local taxation sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the loan from the Fund to the local government.</p><p>3.

Create and maintain other special funds as required by the Authority.</p><p>5. Perform other acts otherwise permitted by applicable law to secure payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the loan from the Fund to the local government and to provide for the remedies of the Fund in the event of any default by the local government in the payment of the loan, including, without limitation, any of the following:</p><p>a. The conveyance of, or the granting of liens on or security interests in, real and personal property, together with all rights, title, and interest therein, to the Fund;</p><p>b. The procurement of insurance, guarantees, letters of credit, and other forms of collateral, security, liquidity arrangements, or credit supports for the loan from any source, public or private, and the payment therefor of premiums, fees, or other charges;</p><p>c. The combination of one or more projects, or the combination of one or more projects with one or more other undertakings, for the purpose of financing, and the pledging of the revenues from such combined projects and undertakings to secure the loan from the Fund to the local government made in connection with such combination or any part or parts thereof;</p><p>d. The maintenance, replacement, renewal, and repair of the project; and</p><p>e. The procurement of casualty and liability insurance.</p><p>6. Obtain a review of the accounting and the internal controls from the Auditor of Public Accounts or his legally authorized representatives.

All local governments borrowing money from the Fund are authorized to perform any acts, take any action, adopt any proceedings, and make and carry out any contracts that are contemplated by this chapter. Such contracts need not be identical among all local governments, but may be structured as determined by the Authority according to the needs of the contracting local governments and the Fund.</p><p>I. Subject to the rights, if any, of the registered owners of any of the bonds of the Authority, the Authority may consent to and approve any modification in the terms of any loan to any local government.</p><p>J. The Department of Housing and Community Development, through its Director, shall have the authority to access and release moneys in the Fund for purposes of this section as long as the disbursement does not exceed the balance of the Fund. If the Department of Housing and Community Development, through its Director, requests a disbursement in an amount exceeding the current Fund balance, the disbursement shall require the written approval of the Governor. Disbursements from the Fund may be made for the purposes outlined in this section, including, but not limited to, personnel, administrative, and equipment costs and expenses directly incurred by the Partnership or the Authority, or by any other agency or political subdivision acting at the direction of the Department of Housing and Community Development.</p><p>K. The Authority is empowered at any time and from time to time to sell, upon such terms and conditions as the Authority shall deem appropriate, any loan, or interest therein, made pursuant to this chapter. The net proceeds of sale remaining after the payment of the costs and expenses of the sale shall be designated for deposit to, and become part of, the Fund.</p><p>L. The Authority may, with the approval of the Department of Housing and Community Development, pledge, assign, or transfer from the Fund to banks or trust companies designated by the Authority any or all of the assets of the Fund to be held in trust as security for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on any or all of the bonds, as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-199/'>62.1-199</a>, issued to finance any project. The interests of the Fund in any assets so transferred shall be subordinate to the rights of the trustee under the pledge, assignment, or transfer. To the extent funds are not available from other sources pledged for such purpose, any of the assets or payments of principal and interest received on the assets pledged, assigned, or transferred or held in trust may be applied by the trustee thereof to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such bonds of the Authority secured thereby, and, if such payments are insufficient for such purpose, the trustee is empowered to sell any or all of such assets and apply the net proceeds from the sale to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such bonds of the Authority. Any assets of the Fund pledged, assigned, or transferred in trust as set forth above and any payments of principal, interest, or earnings received thereon shall remain part of the Fund but shall be subject to the pledge, assignment, or transfer to secure the bonds of the Authority and shall be held by the trustee to which they are pledged, assigned, or transferred until no longer required for such purpose by the terms of the pledge, assignment, or transfer.</p><p>M. The Department of Housing and Community shall develop guidelines governing the use of the Fund and including criteria for project eligibility that considers the extent to which a grant or loan will facilitate the use or reuse of the existing residential property, the extent to which a grant or loan will meet the needs of a recipient, the potential restoration of the property, the economic and environmental benefits to the surrounding community, and the extent of the perceived or real environmental contamination at the site.</p><p>2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0820'>820</a>.</p>"
