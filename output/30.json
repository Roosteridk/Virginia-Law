The Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission shall prepare a fiscal impact statement reflecting the operating costs attributable to and necessary appropriations for any bill which would result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities. The Department of Planning and Budget shall annually provide the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission with the operating cost per inmate.</p><p>B. The Department of Planning and Budget, in conjunction with the Department of Juvenile Justice, shall prepare a fiscal impact statement reflecting the operating costs attributable to and necessary appropriations for any bill that would result in a net increase in periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.</p><p>C. The requirement for a fiscal impact statement includes, but is not limited to, those bills which add new crimes for which imprisonment or commitment is authorized, increase the periods of imprisonment or commitment authorized for existing crimes, impose minimum or mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment or commitment, or modify the law governing release of prisoners or juveniles in such a way that the time served in prison, or the time committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, will increase.</p><p>D. The fiscal impact statement of any bill introduced on or after July 1, 2002, that would result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities or periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, shall include an analysis of the fiscal impact on local and regional jails, state and local pretrial and community-based probation services agencies and juvenile detention facilities.</p><p>E. The amount of the estimated appropriation reflected in the fiscal impact statement shall be printed on the face of each such bill, but shall not be codified. If the agency responsible for preparing the fiscal impact statement does not have sufficient information to project the impact, the fiscal impact statement shall state this, and the words \"Cannot be determined\" shall be printed on the face of each such bill.</p><p>F. The fiscal impact statement shall include, but not be limited to, details as to any increase or decrease in the offender population. Statements prepared by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission shall detail any necessary adjustments in guideline midpoints for the crime or crimes affected by the bill as well as adjustments in guideline midpoints for other crimes affected by the implementation of the bill that, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary and appropriate.</p><p>G. The agency preparing the fiscal impact statement shall forward copies of such impact statements to the Clerk of the House of Delegates and the Clerk of the Senate for transmittal to each patron of the legislation and to the chairman of each committee of the General Assembly to consider the legislation.</p><p>H. For each law enacted which results in a net increase in periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities or a net increase in periods of commitment or the time committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, a one-year appropriation shall be made from the general fund equal to the estimated increase in operating costs of such law, in current dollars, of the highest of the next six fiscal years following the effective date of the law. \"Operating costs\" means all costs other than capital outlay costs.</p><p>I. The Corrections Special Reserve Fund (the Fund) is hereby established as a nonreverting special fund on the books of the Comptroller. The Fund shall consist of all moneys appropriated by the General Assembly under the provisions of this section and all interest thereon. Any moneys deposited in the Fund shall remain in the Fund at the end of the biennium. Moneys in the Fund shall be expended solely for capital expenses, including the cost of planning or preplanning studies that may be required to initiate capital outlay projects.</p><p>1993, c. 804; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0972'>972</a>; 2000, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0825'>825</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0833'>833</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0461'>461</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0133'>133</a>.</p>"

Any legislator who knowingly and intentionally makes a false statement of a material fact on the Statement of Economic Interests is guilty of a Class 5 felony and shall be subject to disciplinary action for such violations by the house in which the legislator sits.</p><p>C. The Statement of Economic Interests of all members of each house shall be reviewed by the Council. If a legislator's Statement is found to be inadequate as filed, the legislator shall be notified in writing and directed to file an amended Statement correcting the indicated deficiencies, and a time shall be set within which such amendment shall be filed. If the Statement of Economic Interests, in either its original or amended form, is found to be adequate as filed, the legislator's filing shall be deemed in full compliance with this section as to the information disclosed thereon.</p><p>D. Ten percent of the membership of a house, on the basis of newly discovered facts, may in writing request the house in which those members sit, in accordance with the rules of that house, to review the Statement of Economic Interests of another member of that house in order to determine the adequacy of his filing. In accordance with the rules of each house, each Statement of Economic Interests shall be promptly reviewed, the adequacy of the filing determined, and notice given in writing to the legislator whose Statement is in issue. Should it be determined that the Statement requires correction, augmentation or revision, the legislator involved shall be directed to make the changes required within such time as shall be set under the rules of each house.</p><p>If a legislator, after having been notified in writing in accordance with the rules of the house in which he sits that his Statement is inadequate as filed, fails to amend his Statement so as to come into compliance within the time limit set, he shall be subject to disciplinary action by the house in which he sits.

A scholarship award made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be reduced by the educational agency upon receipt of any other financial assistance on behalf of the student. However, the scholarship award may be reduced by the Committee to ensure that, when such award is added to other financial assistance, the award does not produce a total of financial assistance that exceeds the annual total costs of tuition, a book allowance, and fees, pursuant to this section. Beginning on July 1, 2008, every educational agency acting as an agent for students receiving awards under this chapter shall notify the Committee and the State Council of Higher Education upon request concerning the type and total of other financial assistance received by such students. In addition, every educational agency accepting for admission persons awarded a Brown v. Board of Education scholarship shall, upon request, provide the Committee information concerning the accreditation status of the school and academic programs offered, and other relevant information as the Committee may require to evaluate the person's eligibility for the scholarship and to determine the eligibility of the educational agency for participation in the Program. Whenever a student withdraws from an educational agency or otherwise fails, regardless of reason, to complete the program in which he is enrolled, the educational agency shall surrender promptly to the Commonwealth the balance of the scholarship award, in accordance with the tuition refund policy in effect at the time of the student's admission to the educational agency.</p><p>F. Any person who uses a false or fictitious name or gives a false or fictitious address in any application for a scholarship or knowingly makes a false statement or conceals a material fact or otherwise commits a fraud in any such application shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.</p><p>G. This chapter shall not be construed as creating any legally enforceable right or entitlement on the part of any person or any right or entitlement to participation in the Program.

Whenever a legislative measure containing a mandated health insurance benefit or provider is proposed that is not identical or substantially similar to a legislative measure previously reviewed by the Commission within the three-year period immediately preceding the then-current session of the General Assembly, the Chair of the House Committee on Labor and Commerce or Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor having jurisdiction over the proposal shall (i) request that the Commission assess the proposal and (ii) send a copy of such request to the Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission (the Bureau). The Commission shall be given a period of 24 months to complete and submit its assessment. A report summarizing the Commission's assessment shall be forwarded to the Chairman of the standing committee that requested the assessment. For the purposes of this section, \"mandated health insurance benefit or provider\" has the same meaning as \"state-mandated health benefit\" provided in § <a href='/vacode/38.2-3406.1/'>38.2-3406.1</a>.</p><p>B. Upon receipt of a copy of such a request, the Bureau shall prepare an analysis of the extent to which the proposed mandate is currently available under qualified health plans in the Commonwealth and advise the Commission as to whether, on the basis of that analysis, the applicable agency has determined or would likely determine, in accordance with applicable federal rules, that the proposed mandate exceeds the scope of the essential health benefits. The Bureau's analysis shall be advisory only and not binding upon the Commission, the Bureau, the State Corporation Commission, or any other parties. As used in this section, \"applicable agency\" means the governmental agency that in accordance with applicable federal rules is responsible for identifying state-mandated benefits that are in addition to the essential health benefits. If the applicable federal rules require an agency of the Commonwealth to identify the state-mandated benefits that are in addition to the essential health benefits but do not identify a specific agency that is responsible for making such identification, the Bureau shall be the applicable agency.</p><p>C. Upon request of the Commission, the Bureau and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission shall jointly assess the social and financial impact and the medical efficacy of the proposed mandate, which assessment shall include an estimate of the effects of enactment of the proposed mandate on the costs of health coverage in the Commonwealth, including any estimated additional costs that the Commonwealth may be responsible for pursuant to § 1311(d)(3)(B) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act should the proposed mandate ultimately be determined by the applicable agency to be a benefit that exceeds the scope of the essential health benefits. Upon completion of the assessment by the Bureau and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the Commission may make a recommendation regarding its support of or opposition to the enactment of the proposed mandate. The Commission's recommendation may address whether the proposed mandate should be provided under health care plans offered through a health benefit exchange or outside a health benefit exchange.</p><p>The Commission shall be given a period of 24 months to complete and submit its assessment. A report summarizing the Commission's study shall be forwarded to the Governor and the General Assembly.</p><p>D. Whenever a legislative measure containing a mandated health insurance benefit or provider is identical or substantially similar to a legislative measure previously reviewed by the Commission within the three-year period immediately preceding the then-current session of the General Assembly, the standing committee may request the Commission to study the measure as provided in subsection A.</p><p>2013, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0709'>709</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0698'>698</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0570'>570</a>; 2017, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0485'>485</a>; 2021, Sp.
