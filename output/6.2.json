        "Body": "<p>A. Any seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or arrangement may impose finance charges at such rate or rates as the seller and the purchaser have agreed. Deferrals and extensions of the time for payment, if allowed by a seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or his assignee, may be subject to a finance charge if agreed to in the original contract or at the time of the renewal or extension. No additional finance charge shall be made for the extension of credit under such a plan or arrangement. If the total finance charge on the transaction is precomputed according to the actuarial method, the finance charge shall be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due. The balance on which such finance charge may be imposed may include the deferred portion of the sales price, costs and charges incidental to the transaction, including (i) any insurance premium financed in connection therewith and (ii) the amount actually paid or to be paid by the seller to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in. The payment by a lessor to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in may be included in the gross capitalized cost of the goods leased and, for purposes of this chapter and Chapter 6 (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-600/'>55.1-600</a> et seq.) of Title 55.1, shall not constitute a loan.</p><p>B. The debtor shall have the right to prepay in full on precomputed transactions and receive a rebate of unearned finance charge determined in accordance with the Rule of 78, as illustrated in § <a href='/vacode/6.2-403/'>6.2-403</a>, or other method elected by the seller under which the finance charge imposed does not exceed the amount that results from application of the Rule of 78 on extensions of credit with an initial maturity of 61 months or less. On extensions of credit with an initial maturity of more than 61 months, the debtor shall receive a rebate computed under a method at least as favorable to the debtor as the actuarial method. The seller may also condition such rebate upon receiving a minimum of $25 in finance charges. This amount, to the extent not earned, may be withheld from the rebate required hereunder.</p><p>C. In connection with such a credit plan, the seller may also:</p><p>1. Impose a late charge pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/6.2-400/'>6.2-400</a>; and</p><p>2. Charge and collect a document fee as may be agreed upon by the seller and purchaser in connection with such credit plan. The document fee shall (i) be for the preparation, handling, and processing of documents relating to the goods or services and to the closing of the transaction and (ii) not be considered a finance charge for the purposes of this chapter.</p><p>D. Premiums for credit life insurance and credit accident and health insurance purchased by the debtor shall not be construed as an additional charge for the extension of credit if such insurance coverage is purchased voluntarily by the debtor. Premiums for property insurance on the goods purchased or leased, including vendor's single interest insurance on such goods, shall not be construed as additional charges for the extension of credit if a clear and conspicuous statement in writing is furnished by the seller or lessor to the buyer or lessee setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the seller or lessor and stating that the buyer or lessee may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.</p><p>1987, c. 622, § 6.1-330.77; 1988, c. 145; 1990, c. 338; 1999, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0062'>62</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0373'>373</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

Upon an order of garnishment, attachment, or other levy addressed to a party to a joint account as mentioned in subsection A, or a trust account as mentioned in subsection C, the financial institution shall:</p><p>1. File an answer setting forth the form of account, whether it has funds responsive to the process, and such information as it has as to the names and addresses of the parties to the account;</p><p>2.

No bank shall make any loan secured by real estate when such loan, together with all prior liens or encumbrances on such real estate, exceeds 90 percent of the appraised value of the real estate securing such loan.</p><p>C. The appraisals necessitated by this section shall be required if the loan shall equal or exceed an amount established from time to time by the Commissioner. In establishing such amount, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the requirements imposed on banks under applicable federal regulations. Such appraisals shall be in writing, signed by the appraisers, and shall be retained in the files of the bank, subject to examination of bank examiners. The appraisers so appointed shall be experienced persons competent to appraise real estate in the locality where the real estate is located.</p><p>D. Any bank may make loans secured by real estate that do not comply with the limitations and restrictions in this section if the total unpaid amount of such loans, exclusive of the loans that subsequently comply with such limitations and restrictions, does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of loans secured by real estate.</p><p>E. The provisions of this section relating to ratio of loan to appraised value and appraisal shall not apply if:</p><p>1. The real estate security is taken solely as an abundance of caution on terms which are not more favorable than they would be in absence of such a lien on real estate;</p><p>2. A real estate security conveyance is taken by or ancillary to the assignment of lease obligations upon which the bank is relying primarily and prudently;</p><p>3. A subsequent transaction results from an existing extension of credit providing (i) that the borrower has performed satisfactorily, (ii) there is no advance of new money, except as formerly agreed, (iii) the credit standing of the borrower is not deteriorating, and (iv) there is no obvious and noticeable deterioration of marketing conditions or the physical assets which provide collateral security to the bank; or</p><p>4. A lien upon real estate is taken to secure a prior advance which was not secured by such real estate.</p><p>F. In cases where an appraisal by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser is not required, under this section or other sections of this chapter in a real estate-related financial transaction, the bank as a matter of prudence may take and preserve a reasonable appraisal, valuation, or analysis of real estate or real property in connection with such transaction.</p><p>G. The Commission may by order or regulation eliminate loans or specific categories of loans from the requirements of this section.</p><p>H. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit any bank from accepting, as security for a loan that it had made in good faith without security or upon security since found to be inadequate, an obligation or obligations secured by mortgage, deed of trust, or other such instrument upon real estate.</p><p>Code 1950, § 6-78; 1952, c. 25; 1956, c. 622; 1960, c. 23; 1964, c. 150; 1966, c. 584, §§ 6.1-63, 6.1-65; 1968, c. 549; 1972, c. 189; 1976, c. 487; 1978, c. 624; 1979, c. 375; 1981, c. 271; 1982, c. 263; 1984, c. 133; 1988, c. 170; 1991, c. 160; 1992, c. 68; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0501'>501</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0263'>263</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

Subject to the foregoing limitations on the businesses that a controlled subsidiary corporation is authorized to conduct, and with the prior approval of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may impose, a controlled subsidiary corporation may also engage in any business that is authorized by statute, regulation, or official interpretation for a subsidiary of a national bank or an out-of-state state bank as defined in § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-836/'>6.2-836</a> to the extent such activity is financial in nature, or incidental or complimentary to a financial activity, and is not otherwise prohibited by state law. A controlled subsidiary corporation transacting business as a real estate brokerage firm shall be governed by § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-888/'>6.2-888</a> and be subject to the provisions of this section. A controlled subsidiary corporation may charge and collect such finance charges and fees or interest rates as are authorized to banks by the laws of the Commonwealth or as otherwise authorized by Chapter 3 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-300/'>6.2-300</a> et seq.).</p><p>D. A controlled subsidiary corporation engaged solely in the business of international banking and finance, and subject to the regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall not be prohibited from receiving deposits or from taking any other action that any such regulated international banking and finance institution is permitted to take.</p><p>E. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-874/'>6.2-874</a> relating to investment of funds in shares of stock of another corporation shall be applicable to controlled subsidiary corporations, except that a controlled subsidiary corporation may acquire, own, and hold stock in a subsidiary corporation if a bank would be permitted to directly acquire, own, or hold the stock hereunder. The provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-876/'>6.2-876</a> relating to loans to officers, directors, or employees of the bank shall be applicable both to loans by the subsidiary to officers, directors, or employees of the bank and to loans by the bank to officers, directors, or employees of the subsidiary, with the approval of the board of directors of the bank only being required for purposes of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-876/'>6.2-876</a>.

The loan limit of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limit of each bank stockholder prorated in accordance with the percentage of stock owned by such bank. However, in the case of a subsidiary, any of the stock, securities, or other obligations of which are owned by a bank holding company, the loan limits of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limits of all bank subsidiaries of such holding company, which share shall be prorated based on the percentage of stock owned by the holding company and all subsidiary banks thereof. In computing whether a bank or a subsidiary that is not wholly owned is complying with its lending limit, the loans of the bank and the subsidiary to any common borrower shall be aggregated on a basis pro rata to the percentage of stock of the subsidiary owned by the bank. Such controlled subsidiary corporation shall not otherwise be subject to the provisions of this chapter except where it is expressly so provided. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, the restrictions set out in §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-874/'>6.2-874</a> through <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-881/'>6.2-881</a> shall not be imposed upon any controlled subsidiary that has no state banks as shareholders.</p><p>1968, c. 270, § 6.1-58.1; 1978, c. 797; 1988, c. 296; 1993, c. 64; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0277'>277</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0060'>60</a>; 2001, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0508'>508</a>; 2003, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0536'>536</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0558'>558</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with the approval of the Commission, and in accordance with the provisions of this section and any regulations adopted pursuant to this section, any mutual association may reorganize to become a mutual holding company by:</p><p>1. Causing a stock association to be formed by incorporating a stock corporation and obtaining a certificate of authority to begin business as a savings institution pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-601/'>13.1-601</a> et seq.) of Title 13.1 and Article 2 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1114/'>6.2-1114</a> et seq.) of this chapter;</p><p>2. Transferring the substantial part of its assets and liabilities, including all of its deposit liabilities, to the stock association created, in exchange for receipt of no less than 51 percent of the capital stock of the stock association; and</p><p>3. Adopting an amended charter changing its name and conforming its organization, governance, and powers to those prescribed hereunder for a mutual holding company.</p><p>B. In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities, the resulting mutual holding company may retain assets to the extent such assets are not required to be transferred to the stock association created in order to satisfy any capital or reserve requirements imposed by applicable state or federal law.</p><p>C. Upon such transfer, all persons who prior thereto held depository rights with respect to or other rights as creditors of the reorganized mutual association shall have such rights solely with respect to the stock association created, and the corresponding liability or obligation of the reorganized mutual association to such persons shall be assumed by the stock association. Persons who prior thereto had any ownership, liquidation, or voting rights with respect to the reorganized mutual association, in their capacities as savings depositors, and pursuant to provision of law, or pursuant to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of that association, shall continue to have such rights but solely with respect to the mutual association in its reorganized form as a mutual holding company. The ownership or liquidation interest of any savings depositor of the subsidiary stock association in the net earnings and net worth of the resulting mutual holding company, and the voting rights of any such depositor in the mutual holding company, shall terminate, or otherwise be limited, in the same manner and on the happening of the same events as was the case prior thereto with the interest held by that depositor in the mutual association.</p><p>D. The reorganization of a mutual association into a mutual holding company shall be conducted in a manner that is equitable to all parties. The board of directors of the mutual association shall first adopt by a two-thirds vote a plan of reorganization, the provisions of which shall comply with requirements set forth in regulations adopted by the Commission. Such plan shall provide that holders of savings deposits in the reorganized mutual association shall be afforded an opportunity to preserve their interests by subscribing to the minority stock of the subsidiary stock association. The Commission shall approve any such plan of reorganization if the Commission ascertains that the reorganization shall not have an adverse effect on the stability of the association and that the reorganized mutual association has complied with all laws and regulations of the Commission relating to the reorganization of a mutual association into a mutual holding company. The Commission shall adopt regulations governing the procedures to be followed in completing the reorganization after the Commission has approved a plan of reorganization. Such regulations shall ensure that the subsidiary association resulting from such reorganization shall continue to have its accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency.</p><p>E. Upon reorganization, the resulting mutual holding company (i) shall continue to possess and may exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges, except deposit-taking powers, of a mutual association under the laws of the Commonwealth and (ii) shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed on savings institution holding companies by §§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1147/'>6.2-1147</a> and <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1192/'>6.2-1192</a>, as well as all limitations and restrictions applicable to mutual savings institutions.</p><p>F. Upon reorganization, the association chartered as a stock corporation shall have the power to issue to persons other than the mutual holding company of which it is a subsidiary, an amount of common stock which in the aggregate does not exceed 49 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of the association. For purposes of this percentage limitation, any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock shall be considered as issued and outstanding common stock. If at any time, the mutual holding company resulting from reorganization sells or otherwise disposes of outstanding shares in its stock association subsidiary, and as a result such mutual holding company no longer owns more than 51 percent of the outstanding shares of such association, or if the subsidiary stock association sells substantially all of its assets in a transaction in which substantially all deposit liabilities of such association are assumed and become liabilities of the purchaser of those assets, the Commission, on application of the Commissioner, may, after reasonable notice to the mutual holding company and its subsidiary stock association, appoint a receiver to wind up the affairs of the mutual holding company.</p><p>G. Any mutual holding company having its principal place of business in the Commonwealth may convert into a stock savings institution holding company, with the approval of the Commissioner, and in accordance with any regulations adopted by the Commission.</p><p>1989, c. 205, § 6.1-194.32:1; 1990, c. 3; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

        "Body": "<p>A. If the Commission finds that: (i) the laws of the Commonwealth are not being fully observed by a savings institution doing business in the Commonwealth; (ii) a savings institution is being operated in an unsafe or unsound manner; (iii) the institution has failed to comply with the lawful orders of the Commission; (iv) the reserve of the institution is insufficient for the protection of account holders; or (v) a savings institution is, or is about to become, insolvent, it shall give immediate notice thereof to the officers and directors of the institution. If necessary to conserve the assets of the institution or to protect the interests of its account holders or the public interest, the Commission may, after reasonable notice to the institution and opportunity for it to be heard:</p><p>1. Close the institution for a period not exceeding 60 days, which period may be further extended for a like period or periods as the Commission deems necessary;</p><p>2. Require the officers and directors of the institution to liquidate, insofar as is required, its outstanding loans;</p><p>3. Require that all lawful orders of the Commission be complied with;</p><p>4. Require the institution to make reports daily or at such other times as it may require as to the results achieved in carrying out its orders;</p><p>5. Temporarily suspend the right of such institution to receive any further deposits;</p><p>6. Without examination, close, for such period or periods as the Commission may deem necessary, any savings institution facing an emergency due to withdrawal of deposits or otherwise, or, without closing such savings institution, grant to it the right to suspend or limit the withdrawal of deposits, for such period as the Commission may determine; or</p><p>7. Require that the savings institution desist from those activities that have resulted in the unsafe or unsound operation of the institution.</p><p>B. If the Commission determines that a receiver should be appointed for a savings institution, the Commission may close the doors of the institution, take charge of the books, assets and affairs of the institution, and apply to any court in the Commonwealth having jurisdiction to appoint receivers for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the institution's business and assets. Proceedings for the appointment of a receiver of a savings institution shall not be entertained by any court except on the application of the Commission.</p><p>C. In any case where the Commission finds that an insured savings institution is insolvent or about to become insolvent, the Commission may seek the appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for the savings institution. The court may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for the savings institution if it finds that to do so would be in the public interest. Upon its being appointed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall not be required to post bond, and it shall have as receiver all those powers afforded under federal law.</p><p>D. The Commissioner may issue and serve upon an association an order to cease and desist from an unsafe or unsound practice or a violation if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, an association (i) is engaging or has engaged, or there is reasonable cause to believe is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the association; or (ii) is violating or has violated, or there is reasonable cause to believe is about to violate, this chapter or any other applicable law, regulation, or order. An order to cease and desist shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or unsafe or unsound practice, and it may require, in terms that may be mandatory or otherwise, an association, its directors, officers, employees, or agents to cease and desist from such violation or practice. The order shall specify the effective date thereof and shall contain a notice to the association of its right to request a hearing on the order in accordance with the Commission's Rules.</p><p>E. When the unsafe or unsound practice or the violation specified in an order to cease and desist, or any continuation thereof, is likely to prejudice the interests of the account holders or the stockholders of an association, the Commissioner may issue his order effective immediately. An order to cease and desist shall remain in effect until it is withdrawn by the Commissioner or is terminated by the Commission after a hearing on the matter. A request for hearing under this section shall be given expeditious treatment on the docket of the Commission, and the Commission need not allow for 10 days' notice to the parties.</p><p>Code 1950, § 6-201.60; 1960, c. 402; 1966, c. 584, § 6.1-190; 1972, c. 796, § 6.1-195.70; 1983, c. 506; 1985, c. 425, § 6.1-194.83; 1990, c. 3; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

In such event, the approval by the Commission of such plan of merger or consolidation shall be the equivalent of approval by the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of such state savings institution for all purposes of Article 12 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-715.1/'>13.1-715.1</a> et seq.) of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 or the approval of two-thirds of the members for all purposes of Article 11 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-893.1/'>13.1-893.1</a> et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 13.1.</p><p>C. If the Commission finds that (i) a state savings institution is insolvent, or in its opinion, the financial stability of a state savings institution is threatened, (ii) the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of such savings institution by another savings institution or by a bank is in the best interests of the stockholders, members or depositors of such state savings institution, and that such acquisition of the assets and liabilities is in the public interest, and (iii) an emergency exists, it may, with the consent of the board of directors of both institutions as to the terms and conditions of such transfer, including the assumption of all or certain liabilities, enter an order transferring some or all of the assets and liabilities of such state savings institution to such other savings institution or bank. In such event, compliance with the provisions of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-723/'>13.1-723</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-724/'>13.1-724</a>, <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-899/'>13.1-899</a>, or <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-900/'>13.1-900</a> shall not be required, and § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-730/'>13.1-730</a> shall not be applicable to such transfer.</p><p>D. In the case either of such a merger, consolidation or a transfer of assets and liabilities, the Commission shall provide that prompt notice of its findings, and plan of merger, consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities, be sent to the stockholders or members of record of such insolvent savings institution or savings institution threatened with financial instability for the purpose of providing such shareholders or members an opportunity to challenge the findings of the Commission and the plan of merger, consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities. The relevant books and records of such state savings institution shall remain intact and be made available to such shareholders or members for a period of 30 days after such notice is sent. The Commission's findings and plan of merger, consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities shall become final if a hearing before the Commission is not requested by any such shareholder or member in a written request delivered to the Commission within 15 days after the notice specified by this section is sent. Any such request for a hearing shall contain a statement of the specific grounds for such shareholder's or member's challenge to the Commissioner's findings and plan of merger, or consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities.</p><p>E. If, after a hearing as provided in subsection D, the Commission finds that good cause has been shown for the reversal or modification of its initial findings, or for rescission or modification of its initial plan for merger, consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities, the Commission shall enter its final order accordingly. If, after such hearing, the Commission affirms its original findings and plan for merger, or consolidation or transfer of assets and liabilities, its order shall be final.</p><p>F. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any institution resulting from a merger, consolidation or a transfer of assets and liabilities under the provisions of this section shall have the right to retain and operate all offices of the institution so merged, consolidated or acquired that were in operation at the time of such merger, or consolidation or acquisition. This section shall not be construed to allow the establishment of additional branches by any institution resulting from such merger, consolidation or transfer than would otherwise be allowed by the laws of the Commonwealth.</p><p>G. The Commission shall authorize transactions under this section in the following order of priority:</p><p>1. Between financial institutions of the same type located within the Commonwealth;</p><p>2. Between financial institutions of different types located within the Commonwealth;</p><p>3. Between financial institutions of the same type including depository institutions located outside the Commonwealth; and</p><p>4. Between financial institutions of different types including depository institutions located outside the Commonwealth.</p><p>H. In considering transactions involving financial institutions located outside the Commonwealth, the Commission shall give priority to plans of merger, consolidation or asset acquisition involving financial institutions located in states adjoining the Commonwealth or located in the District of Columbia.</p><p>I. Any institution resulting from a transaction authorized by this section whose main office is located outside of the Commonwealth shall, as a condition of being able to do business in the Commonwealth, allow the Commission to examine such institution from time to time as the Commission deems necessary. In conducting such examinations, the Commission shall have all of the powers provided by this title relating to the examination of financial institutions.</p><p>J. The provisions of Article 5 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1148/'>6.2-1148</a> et seq.) of this chapter shall not apply to mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions authorized by the provisions of this section.</p><p>1983, c. 450, § 6.1-195.70:2; 1985, c. 425, § 6.1-194.88; 1991, c. 230, § 6.1-194.150; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0353'>353</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>.</p>"

If necessary to conserve the assets of the credit union or protect the interests of the members of the credit union, the Commission may, after reasonable notice to the credit union and an opportunity for it to be heard, do any one or more of the following:</p><p>1. Close the credit union for a period not exceeding 60 days, which period may be extended for additional like periods as the Commission may deem necessary;</p><p>2. Require the officers and directors of the credit union to liquidate outstanding loans;</p><p>3. Require that all lawful orders of the Commission be complied with;</p><p>4.

In the case of a federally insured credit union, the court shall appoint the National Credit Union Administration Board as receiver if it finds that the National Credit Union Administration Board is willing to accept the appointment. In the case of a credit union that is not federally insured, the court shall appoint a receiver if it finds that to do so will be in the public interest.</p><p>C.

No member shall be so expelled until he has been informed in writing of the charges against him, and an opportunity has been given to him, after reasonable notice, to be heard.</p><p>E. Members of the credit union shall not be personally liable for payment of the debts of the credit union.</p><p>F. The surviving spouse of a deceased credit union member shall be eligible to become a member of the credit union to which the deceased member belonged. In no other instance shall an individual be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the individual's relationship to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household of such person. The board of directors of a credit union may provide in the bylaws for a less inclusive policy governing membership by virtue of relationship to another person, and such policy shall be effective.</p><p>G. Societies, associations, organizations, partnerships, and corporations composed of persons who are eligible for membership may be admitted to membership in the same manner and under the same conditions as such persons.</p><p>H.

In any case in which the surviving credit union will be a Virginia state-chartered credit union, a merger application, accompanied by an application fee of $300, shall be filed with the Commission. The Commission shall approve the application if the Commission finds that:</p><p>1. The field of membership of the credit union which is proposed to result from the merger satisfies the requirements of subsection B of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1327/'>6.2-1327</a>, unless the merger application is exempt from this condition pursuant to subsection B;</p><p>2. The plan of merger will promote the best interests of the members of the credit unions; and</p><p>3. The members of the merging credit unions have approved the plan of merger in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding subsection D of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-895/'>13.1-895</a>, the members of a Virginia state-chartered credit union may authorize a plan of merger by vote of at least a majority of all votes cast thereon at an annual or special meeting at which a quorum is present. Notwithstanding the terms of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-895/'>13.1-895</a>, in a merger where a Virginia credit union will be the resulting credit union, the adoption of the plan of merger by the board of directors of that credit union shall be sufficient approval of the plan, and approval of the plan of merger by the members of that credit union shall not be required. Notice of the meeting may be given in a manner prescribed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, notwithstanding the terms of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-842/'>13.1-842</a> relating to the manner of notice. A federal credit union merging with a state credit union may give notice to its members as prescribed by federal regulation.</p><p>B.

If the Commission finds that the applicable requirements of subsection A have been met and all required fees have been paid, it shall approve the merger and issue a certificate of merger, which shall be admitted to record in its office and in the office for the recording of deeds in the city or county in which the registered office of each credit union is located. No such further recordation shall be required in the City of Richmond or the Counties of Chesterfield or Henrico.</p><p>D.

For the purposes of this section, a member entitled to vote may vote in person or, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws otherwise provide, by proxy.

An appointment of a proxy becomes effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes.

A state credit union is authorized to convert to a mutual savings institution organized under Chapter 11 (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1100/'>6.2-1100</a> et seq.) of this title.</p><p>B. As a condition to converting to a mutual savings institution, a credit union shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p>1. At least 60 days prior to a final vote by the board of directors to formally adopt a conversion proposal, the credit union shall send notice to the Commissioner and each member advising that the board is considering a possible conversion to a mutual savings institution. Such notice also shall be (i) published concurrently in a newspaper of general circulation in the credit union's service area; (ii) posted on the credit union's website; and (iii) posted in a conspicuous place in the lobby of each of the credit union's offices. The notice shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:</p><p>a. A prominent legend in bold-face type that advises the members of a potential conversion;</p><p>b. The electronic availability of information related to a potential conversion;</p><p>c. A telephone number and e-mail address that members may use to request copies of the potential conversion information that is available by electronic means;</p><p>d. The ability of members to submit written comments on the potential conversion; and</p><p>e. A clear, concise, and impartial description of the potential conversion to be considered by the board.</p><p>2. The credit union shall post information related to a potential conversion on the credit union's principal Internet web site at least 60 days prior to a vote by the board of directors to adopt a proposal of conversion. The posted information shall, at a minimum, discuss:</p><p>a. The business purposes that might be accomplished by a conversion;</p><p>b. The differences between and similarities of a credit union and a mutual savings institution;</p><p>c. An estimate of the anticipated conversion expenses;</p><p>d. The methods by which a member may request a copy of the posted information;</p><p>e. The method and timeline for members to submit written comments on the potential conversion; and</p><p>f. The process that will be followed if the board formally adopts a conversion proposal.</p><p>3. The board shall provide members a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments relating to a potential conversion. The board may hold a special meeting to receive member input regarding the potential conversion. It is within the board's discretion to determine the type, number, duration, and location of any special meeting. Before taking a final vote on a conversion proposal, the board shall review and consider all written comments and any other member input received at any special meeting. The conversion resolution shall state that the board has reviewed and considered all such comments and input and has determined affirmatively that the conversion is in the best interests of the members.</p><p>4. Subsequent to the written comment period, the credit union shall adopt, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of its board of directors, a conversion proposal consistent with this section. The credit union shall notify the Commissioner of the board's approval of the proposal, and shall file an application in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1118/'>6.2-1118</a> and pay the accompanying fee in accordance with § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1202/'>6.2-1202</a>. In addition, the credit union shall send to the Commissioner as soon as reasonably practical (i) a budget of the anticipated conversion expenses including legal, postage and mailing, advertising, printing, consulting fees, examination and operating fees, and any overtime or other employee compensation to be paid exclusively as a result of the conversion and (ii) any other information reasonably requested by the Commissioner.</p><p>5. At least 30 days prior to a vote by the members to formally adopt the conversion proposal, the credit union shall mail to each member a notice of a meeting of the members to consider the conversion proposal, advising the members of the board's adoption of the conversion proposal. The notice must include a prominent statement that the conversion will be decided by a vote of members eligible to vote on the proposal under the credit union's bylaws and that the affirmative votes of two-thirds of those eligible members voting are required for approval unless the articles of incorporation require a greater or lesser vote in which case the notice shall specify that percentage. However, in no case shall the percentage vote be less than a majority of the members voting notwithstanding what is specified in the articles of incorporation. The notice shall clearly inform the members that they may vote at the members' meeting on the proposal or submit the written ballot included with the notice. Each eligible member is entitled to one vote. With the notice, members shall be provided plain language disclosures of material facts and information to be used as a basis for reaching an informed decision to vote on the conversion, including but not limited to a summary of all information required by subdivision B 2. The disclosures shall be submitted to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may suggest changes in the disclosures prior to the documents being mailed to members.</p><p>6. A director, officer, committee member, agent, or senior management employee of the credit union, and immediate family members of any such individuals, shall not, directly or indirectly, receive a fee, commission, or other consideration, other than that person's usual salary or compensation, for aiding, promoting, or assisting in a conversion under this section. A violation of this subdivision shall constitute a prima facie violation of subsection A of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-870/'>13.1-870</a>.</p><p>7. The corporate existence of a credit union converting under this section shall continue in its successor. Each member shall be entitled to receive a share or deposit account or accounts in the converted institution equal in amount to the value of accounts held in the former credit union subject to any lien or right of offset held by the credit union.</p><p>8. The Commission shall approve the conversion if all of the conditions required by this section and § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1118/'>6.2-1118</a> have been met, unless the Commission determines that, because of a concern over the safety and soundness of the credit union, the conversion is not in the best interest of the credit union or its members.</p><p>9. The eligible and voting members of the credit union must approve the conversion proposal by a two-thirds affirmative vote of those voting, or such greater or lesser vote provided for under the articles of incorporation, but in no event less than a majority of the members voting notwithstanding what the articles of incorporation may specify. Such vote shall be by secret ballot and shall be conducted by an independent entity, which may be such credit union's legal or accounting firm.</p><p>10. Following approval of the conversion by the members, the conversion shall become effective when (i) the Commission shall have approved it and (ii) any amendment of the articles of incorporation of the credit union necessary to effect the conversion shall have become effective.</p><p>C. If any requirements for notice, meetings, voting or other requirements in this section are inconsistent with the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-801/'>13.1-801</a> et seq.), the provisions of this section shall control.</p><p>2010, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0230'>230</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0372'>372</a>, § 6.1-225.30:1.</p>"

Upon payment of the full amount of principal due plus accrued interest and any other applicable fees within the first 30 days, whether through outside funds or a refinancing under a new loan advance, the borrower shall be entitled to a full rebate of the loan processing fee less an amount not to exceed $50 or the actual loan processing fee, whichever is less. If a loan is refinanced or renewed, a licensee may assess an additional loan processing fee on the loan no more than once during any 12-month period.</p><p>D.

The following provisions shall apply to the database:</p><p>1. Before making a short-term loan, a licensee shall query the database through a Commission-certified database provider and shall retain evidence of the query for the Commission's supervisory review. The database shall allow a licensee to make a short-term loan only if making the loan is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. During any period that the database is unavailable due to technical problems beyond the licensee's control, a licensee may rely on the loan applicant's written representations, rather than the database's information, to verify that making the loan applied for is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. Because a licensee may rely on the accuracy of the applicant's representations and the database's information, a licensee is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability if that information is later determined to be inaccurate.</p><p>2. The database provider shall maintain the database, take all actions it deems necessary to protect the confidentiality and security of the information contained in the database, be responsible for the confidentiality and security of such information, and own the information contained in the database. The Commission shall have access to and utilize the database as a supervision and enforcement tool to ensure licensees' compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</p><p>3. Upon a licensee's query, the database shall advise the licensee whether the applicant is eligible for a new short-term loan and, if the applicant is ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility. If the database advises the licensee that the applicant is ineligible for a short-term loan, then the applicant shall direct any inquiry regarding the specific reason for such ineligibility to the database provider rather than to the licensee. The information contained in the database is confidential and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (§ <a href='/vacode/2.2-3700/'>2.2-3700</a> et seq.).</p><p>4. If a licensee and borrower consummate a loan, then the licensee shall pay a fee to defray the costs of submitting the database inquiry. The amount of the database inquiry fee shall be calculated in accordance with a schedule set by the Commission. The schedule shall bear a reasonable relationship to actual cost of the operation of the database. If a licensee submits a database inquiry but does not consummate a loan with the applicant, then the licensee shall not pay the database inquiry fee. Each licensee shall remit all database inquiry fees directly to the database provider on a weekly basis.</p><p>5. If a borrower enters into a short-term loan or pays or otherwise satisfies a short-term loan in full, then the licensee making the loan shall report such event or other information to the database not later than the close of business on the date of such event.</p><p>2008, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0849'>849</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0876'>876</a>, § 6.1-453.1; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1215'>1215</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1258'>1258</a>.</p>"

A licensee shall not charge, collect, or receive, directly or indirectly, credit insurance premiums, charges for any ancillary product sold, charges for disbursing loan proceeds or refunds including check-cashing charges and any other charges for negotiating forms of payment other than cash, charges for brokering or obtaining a loan, or any fees, interest, or charges in connection with a loan, other than fees and charges permitted by § <a href='/vacode/6.2-1817/'>6.2-1817</a>.</p><p>3. A licensee shall not obtain any agreement from the borrower (i) giving the licensee or any third person power of attorney or authority to confess judgment for the borrower; (ii) authorizing the licensee or any third party to bring suit against the borrower in a court outside the Commonwealth; or (iii) waiving the borrower's right to legal recourse or any other right the borrower has under any otherwise applicable provision of state or federal law.</p><p>4. A licensee shall not make a loan to a person if that person is obligated upon any loan to a person licensed under Chapter 22 (§ <a href='/vacode/6.2-2200/'>6.2-2200</a> et seq.). Prior to making a loan, a licensee shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the borrower's eligibility under this subsection that includes reviewing the files of any affiliate that is licensed under Chapter 22. Unless the Commission requires otherwise by administrative rule or policy statement, a licensee may rely on the loan applicant's written representations with respect to the applicant's obligations to lenders that are licensed under Chapter 22 (§ <a href='/vacode/6.2-2200/'>6.2-2200</a> et seq.) but are not affiliates of the licensee, and a licensee is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability if such representations are later determined to be inaccurate.</p><p>5. A licensee shall not cause any person to be obligated to the licensee in any capacity at any time in the principal amount of more than $2,500.</p><p>6. Except as provided in § <a href='/vacode/6.2-1818.1/'>6.2-1818.1</a>, a licensee shall not refinance, renew, or extend any short-term loan or make a loan to a person if the loan would cause the person to have more than one short-term loan from any licensee outstanding at the same time.</p><p>7. A licensee shall not cause a borrower to be obligated upon more than one loan at any time.</p><p>8. A check accepted by a licensee as security for any loan shall be dated no earlier than the date of the first required loan payment shown in the loan agreement.</p><p>9. Notwithstanding any provision of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-226.10/'>8.01-226.10</a> to the contrary, a licensee shall not threaten, or cause to be instigated, criminal proceedings against a borrower if a check given as security for a loan is dishonored or for any reason related to the borrower's failure to pay any sum due under a loan agreement.</p><p>10. A licensee shall not (i) accept the title or registration of a vehicle, real or personal property, or any interest in any property other than a check payable to the licensee as security for a loan; (ii) create or accept any remotely created check, as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 229.2(fff), in connection with a loan; (iii) draft funds electronically from a borrower's account without express written authorization from the borrower; or (iv) fail to stop attempts to draft funds electronically from a borrower's account upon request from the borrower or his agent. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the conversion of a negotiable instrument into an electronic form for processing through the automated clearing house system.</p><p>11. A licensee shall not present a check, negotiable order of withdrawal, share draft, or other negotiable instrument that has been previously presented by the licensee and subsequently returned dishonored for any reason, unless the licensee obtains new written authorization from the borrower to present the previously returned item.</p><p>12. A licensee shall not attempt to draft funds electronically from a borrower's account after two consecutive attempts have failed, unless the licensee obtains new written authorization from the borrower to transfer or withdraw funds electronically from the borrower's account.</p><p>13. A licensee shall not make a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to (i) pay for any other product or service sold at the licensee's office location or (ii) repay any amount owed to the licensee or an affiliate of the licensee in connection with another credit transaction.</p><p>14. Loan proceeds shall be disbursed in cash or by the licensee's business check. No fee shall be charged by the licensee or an affiliate for cashing a loan proceeds check.</p><p>15. A check given as security for a loan shall not be negotiated to a third party.</p><p>16. Upon receipt of a check given as security for a loan, the licensee shall stamp the check with an endorsement stating: \"This check is being negotiated as part of a short-term loan pursuant to Chapter 18 (§ <a href='/vacode/6.2-1800/'>6.2-1800</a> et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia, and any holder of this check takes it subject to all claims and defenses of the maker.\"</p><p>17. Before entering into a short-term loan, the licensee shall provide each borrower with a pamphlet, in form consistent with regulations adopted by the Commission, explaining in plain language the rights and responsibilities of the borrower and providing a toll-free number at the Commission for assistance with complaints.</p><p>18. Each licensee shall conspicuously post in each approved office (i) a schedule of fees and interest charges, which shall include examples using a $300 loan repaid in three months, a $500 loan repaid in five months, and a $1,000 loan repaid in 10 months, and (ii) a notice containing the following statement: \"If you wish to file a complaint against us, you may contact the Bureau of Financial Institutions at [insert contact information].\" The Commission shall furnish licensees with the appropriate contact information.</p><p>19. A licensee shall not knowingly make a short-term loan to a person who is a member of the military services of the United States or the spouse or other dependent of a member of the military services of the United States. Prior to making a short-term loan, every licensee shall inquire of every prospective borrower if he is a member of the military services of the United States or the spouse or other dependent of a member of the military services of the United States. The loan documents shall include verification that the borrower is not a member of the military services of the United States or the spouse or other dependent of a member of the military services of the United States.</p><p>20. In collecting or attempting to collect a short-term loan, a licensee shall comply with the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to debt collectors contained in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.) regarding harassment or abuse, false or misleading misrepresentations, and unfair practices in collections.</p><p>21. A licensee shall not contact a borrower for any reason other than (i) for the borrower's benefit regarding upcoming payments, options for obtaining loans, payment options, payment due dates, the effect of default, or, after default, receiving payments or other actions permitted by the licensee; (ii) to advise the borrower of missed payments or dishonored checks; or (iii) to assist the transmittal of payments via a third-party mechanism.</p><p>22. A short-term loan agreement shall not be sold or otherwise assigned to any other person who is not also a licensee, and if a loan agreement or its servicing is sold or assigned to another licensee, the buyer or assignee of the loan agreement shall be subject to the same obligations under this chapter that apply to the selling or assigning licensee. If a licensee sells or assigns a short-term loan or its servicing, the licensee shall provide to the borrower written notice and the information needed to make future payments no later than 10 days before the borrower's next payment due date.</p><p>23. A licensee shall not make a loan to a borrower that includes an acceleration clause or demand feature that permits the licensee, in the event the borrower fails to meet the repayment terms for any outstanding balance, to terminate the loan in advance of the original maturity date and to demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance, unless both of the following conditions are met: (i) not earlier than 10 days after the borrower's payment was due, the licensee provides written notice to the borrower of the termination of the loan and (ii) in addition to the outstanding balance, the licensee collects only prorated interest and the fees earned up to termination of the loan. For purposes of this subdivision, the outstanding balance and prorated interest and fees shall be calculated as if the borrower had voluntarily prepaid the loan in full on the date of termination.</p><p>24. A licensee may not file or initiate a legal proceeding of any kind against a borrower until 60 days after the date of default on a short-term loan, during which period the licensee and borrower may voluntarily enter into a repayment arrangement.</p><p>25. A licensee shall not recommend to a borrower that the borrower obtain a loan for a dollar amount that is higher than the borrower has requested.</p><p>26. A licensee may not engage in any unfair, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent acts or practices in the conduct of its business.</p><p>2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0897'>897</a>, § 6.1-459; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0593'>593</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0295'>295</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0571'>571</a>; 2008, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0849'>849</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0876'>876</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0794'>794</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0501'>501</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1215'>1215</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1258'>1258</a>.</p>"

Except as provided in this section, no person shall acquire directly or indirectly 25 percent or more of the voting shares of a corporation or 25 percent or more of the ownership of any other entity licensed to conduct business under this chapter unless such person first:</p><p>1. Files an application with the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe from time to time;</p><p>2. Delivers such information as the Commission may require concerning the financial responsibility, background, experience, and activities of the applicant, its directors, senior officers, principals, and members, and of any proposed new directors, senior officers, principals, or members of the licensee;</p><p>3. Furnishes to the Commissioner information concerning the identity of the directors, senior officers, principals, and members of the applicant, and of any proposed new directors, senior officers, principals, or members of the licensee.

In the case of directors, senior officers, principals, and members who have resided in the United States at any time within the previous 10 years, such individuals shall consent to a national and state criminal history records check and submit to fingerprinting. Each director, senior officer, principal, and member shall pay for the cost of such fingerprinting and criminal records check. Such individuals shall cause their fingerprints, personal descriptive information, and records check fees to be submitted to either of the following, as prescribed by the Commissioner:</p><p>(1) The Bureau, which shall forward these items to the Central Criminal Records Exchange. The Central Criminal Records Exchange shall (i) conduct a search of its own criminal history records and forward such individuals' fingerprints and personal descriptive information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining national criminal history record information regarding such individuals, and (ii) forward the results of the state and national records search to the Commissioner or his designee, who shall be an employee of the Commission; or</p><p>(2) The Registry, provided that it is capable of processing such criminal history records check.</p><p>b. In the case of directors, senior officers, principals, and members who have resided outside of the United States at any time within the previous 10 years, such individuals shall cause an investigative background report to be submitted to the Commissioner. The report shall be prepared by an independent search firm that is acceptable to the Commissioner and be in the English language. Each director, senior officer, principal, and member shall pay for the cost of such report, and the report shall be sent directly by the search firm to the Commissioner or his designee, who shall be an employee of the Commission; and</p><p>4. Pays such application fee as the Commission may prescribe.</p><p>B. If any material information provided by the applicant changes during the investigation period, the applicant shall immediately notify the Commissioner.</p><p>C. Upon the filing and investigation of an application, the Commission shall permit the applicant to acquire the interest in the licensee if it finds that the applicant, its members if applicable, its directors, senior officers, and principals, and any proposed new directors, members, senior officers, and principals have the financial responsibility, character, reputation, experience, and general fitness to warrant belief that the business will be operated efficiently and fairly, in the public interest, and in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. The Commission shall grant or deny the application within 90 days from the date a completed application, accompanied by the required fee, is filed unless the period is extended by the Commission. If the application is denied, the Commission shall notify the applicant of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p><p>D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the acquisition of an interest in a licensee directly or indirectly by merger, consolidation, or otherwise, (i) by or with a person licensed under this chapter, (ii) by or with a person affiliated through common ownership with the licensee, or (iii) by bequest, descent, survivorship, or by operation of law. The person acquiring an interest in a licensee in a transaction which is exempt from filing an application by this subsection shall send written notice to the Commission of such acquisition within 30 days after its closing.</p><p>E. If any person acquires an ownership interest in a licensee without obtaining prior approval from the Commission as required by this section, the Commission may for good cause shown order such person to divest himself or itself of such ownership interest.</p><p>F. The Commission may not enter an order requiring divestiture pursuant to subsection E until it has given the person 21 days' notice in writing of the reasons for the proposed divestiture and has given the person an opportunity to introduce evidence and be heard. The notice shall be sent by certified mail to such person and shall state with particularity the grounds for the contemplated action. Within 14 days of mailing the notice, the person named therein may file with the clerk of the Commission a written request for a hearing.

Each debt settlement services agreement shall be evidenced by a written agreement, which shall be maintained in either a hard copy, including a faxed copy, or electronic version and which shall be signed by the consumer and a person authorized by the licensee to sign such agreements and dated the same day the debt settlement services agreement is executed by the consumer. The agreement may be signed by the parties either originally or by electronic signature. The agreement shall set forth, at a minimum, (i) the name and address of both the consumer and the licensee; (ii) a full description of all services to be performed for the consumer by the licensee; (iii) a clear explanation, highlighted in bold type, of the costs to the consumer; (iv) a statement that the debt settlement services agreement may be terminated for any reason by the consumer and that the consumer has no obligation to continue the arrangement unless satisfied with the services provided; (v) an explanation of the method of dispute resolution under the agreement; (vi) an explanation of the obligations of the consumer and the licensee that are subject to the agreement; and (vii) notification of privacy policies in compliance with state and federal laws and regulations.</p><p>2.

The licensee has negotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt pursuant to a debt settlement services agreement it executed with a consumer; and</p><p>b. The consumer has made at least one payment to a creditor following the licensee's negotiation, settlement, reduction, or other alteration of at least one debt owned by the consumer to that creditor.</p><p>4.

The amount of time necessary to achieve the represented results and, to the extent that the services may include a settlement offer to any of the customer's creditors or debt collectors, the time by which the licensee will make a bona fide settlement offer to each of them;</p><p>b. To the extent that the services may include a settlement offer to any of the customer's creditors or debt collectors, the amount of money or the percentage of each outstanding debt that the customer must accumulate before the licensee will make a bona fide settlement offer to each of them; and</p><p>c. To the extent that any aspect of the debt settlement services relies upon or results in the consumer's failure to make timely payments to creditors or debt collectors, that the use of the debt settlement services will likely adversely affect the consumer's creditworthiness, may result in the consumer being subject to collections or sued by creditors or debt collectors, and may increase the amount of money the consumer owes due to the accrual of fees and interest.</p><p>5. A licensee shall not require a consumer to execute a power of attorney, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/64.2-1600/'>64.2-1600</a>, as a condition of receiving debt settlement services.</p><p>6.

The entity administering the account does not give or accept any money or other compensation in exchange for referrals of business involving the debt settlement services provider; and</p><p>e. The consumer may withdraw from the debt settlement services at any time without penalty and must receive all funds in the account, other than the fee earned by the debt settlement services provider for completed services, if any, subject to the limitations imposed in § <a href='/vacode/6.2-2041/'>6.2-2041</a>.</p><p>7.

A licensee shall not charge, collect, or receive, directly or indirectly, credit insurance premiums, charges for any ancillary product sold, charges for disbursing loan proceeds or refunds including check-cashing charges and any other charges for negotiating forms of payment other than cash, charges for brokering or obtaining a loan, or any fees, interest, or charges in connection with a loan, other than fees and charges permitted by § <a href='/vacode/6.2-2216/'>6.2-2216</a>;</p><p>3. A licensee shall not make a loan to a person if that person is obligated upon any loan to a person licensed under Chapter 18 (§ <a href='/vacode/6.2-1800/'>6.2-1800</a> et seq.). Prior to making a loan, a licensee shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the prospective borrower's eligibility under this section which shall include reviewing the files of any affiliate that is licensed under Chapter 18. Unless the Commission requires otherwise by administrative rule or policy statement, a licensee may rely on the loan applicant's written representations with respect to the applicant's obligations to lenders that are licensed under Chapter 18 but are not affiliates of the licensee and a licensee is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability if such representations are later determined to be inaccurate;</p><p>4. Except as provided in § <a href='/vacode/6.2-2216.2/'>6.2-2216.2</a>, a licensee shall not refinance, renew, or extend any title loan or make a loan to a person if the loan would cause the person to have more than one title loan from any licensee outstanding at the same time;</p><p>5.

A licensee shall not obtain any agreement from the borrower (i) giving the licensee or any third person power of attorney or authority to confess judgment for the borrower; (ii) authorizing the licensee or any third party to bring suit against the borrower in a court outside the Commonwealth; or (iii) waiving the borrower's right to legal recourse or any other right the borrower has under any otherwise applicable provision of state or federal law;</p><p>8. A motor vehicle title loan agreement shall not (i) contain a provision by which a person acting on behalf of the licensee is treated as an agent of the borrower in connection with its formation or execution other than for purposes of filing or releasing a lien with the state where the motor vehicle is registered or (ii) be sold or otherwise assigned to any other person who is not also a licensee, and if a loan agreement is sold or assigned to another licensee, the buyer or assignee of the loan agreement shall be subject to the same obligations under this chapter that apply to the selling or assigning licensee. If a motor vehicle title loan or its servicing is sold or assigned, a licensee shall provide to the borrower written notice and the information needed to make future payments no later than 10 days before the borrower's next payment due date;</p><p>9. Loan proceeds shall be disbursed (i) in cash, (ii) by the licensee's business check, or (iii) by debit card provided that the borrower will not be directly charged a fee by the licensee in connection with the withdrawal of the funds. No fee shall be charged by the licensee or affiliate for cashing a title loan proceeds check;</p><p>10. A licensee shall not (i) accept a check, real or personal property, or any interest in any property other than the title of one motor vehicle owned by the borrower as security for a title loan; (ii) create or accept any remotely created check, as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 229.2(fff), in connection with a loan; (iii) draft funds electronically from a borrower's account without express written authorization from the borrower; (iv) fail to stop attempts to draft funds electronically from a borrower's account upon request from the borrower or his agent; or (v) require or accept from a borrower a set of keys to a motor vehicle that secures a loan. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the conversion of a negotiable instrument into an electronic form for processing through the automated clearing house system.

A licensee shall not attempt to draft funds electronically from a borrower's account after two consecutive attempts have failed, unless the licensee obtains new written authorization from the borrower to transfer or withdraw funds electronically from the borrower's account;</p><p>12. A licensee shall not make a motor vehicle title loan if, on the date the loan agreement is signed by the borrower, the motor vehicle's certificate of title evidences that the motor vehicle is security for another loan or otherwise is encumbered by a lien;</p><p>13. A licensee shall (i) hold the certificate of title to the motor vehicle throughout the period that the loan agreement is in effect and (ii) within seven days following the date of the motor vehicle title loan agreement, file to have its security interest in the motor vehicle added to its certificate of title by complying with the requirements of § <a href='/vacode/46.2-637/'>46.2-637</a>, or in the case of a motor vehicle registered in a state other than the Commonwealth by complying with that state's requirements for perfecting a security interest in a motor vehicle;</p><p>14.

Prior to making a motor vehicle title loan, every licensee or affiliate shall inquire of every prospective borrower if the individual is a covered member of the armed forces or a dependent of a covered member. The prospective borrower shall affirm in writing to the licensee or affiliate if he is not a covered member of the armed forces or a dependent of a covered member. For purposes of this section, \"covered member of the armed forces\" means a person on active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less or on active guard and reserve duty. For purposes of this section, \"dependent of a covered member of the armed forces\" means the member's spouse, the member's child as defined by 38 U.S.C. § 101 (4), or an individual for whom the member provided more than one-half of the individual's support for 180 days immediately preceding the date the motor vehicle title loan is sought;</p><p>17. In collecting or attempting to collect a motor vehicle title loan, a licensee shall comply with the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to debt collectors contained in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.) regarding harassment or abuse, false, misleading or deceptive statements or representations, and unfair practices in collections;</p><p>18. A licensee shall not contact a borrower for any reason other than (i) for the borrower's benefit regarding upcoming payments, options for obtaining loans, payment options, payment due dates, the effect of default, or, after default, receiving payments or other actions permitted by the licensee; (ii) to advise the borrower of missed payments or dishonored checks; (iii) to advise the borrower regarding a repossessed or surrendered vehicle; or (iv) to assist the transmittal of payments via a third-party mechanism;</p><p>19. A licensee shall not make a loan to a borrower that includes an acceleration clause or a demand feature that permits the licensee, in the event the borrower fails to meet the repayment terms for any outstanding balance, to terminate the loan in advance of the original maturity date and to demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance, unless both of the following conditions are met: (i) not earlier than 10 days after the borrower's payment was due, the licensee provides written notice to the borrower of the termination of the loan and (ii) in addition to the outstanding balance, the licensee collects only prorated interest and the fees earned up to the date the loan was terminated or the borrower's vehicle was repossessed or surrendered, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this subsection, the outstanding balance and prorated interest and fees shall be calculated as if the borrower had voluntarily prepaid the loan in full on the date of termination, repossession, or surrender;</p><p>20. A licensee shall not recommend to a borrower that the borrower obtain a loan for a dollar amount that is higher than the borrower has requested;</p><p>21. A licensee shall not (i) engage in any unfair, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent acts or practices in the conduct of its business or (ii) threaten, or cause to be instigated, criminal proceedings against a borrower arising from the borrower's failure to pay any sum due under a loan agreement;</p><p>22. A licensee shall provide a safe place for the keeping of all certificates of title while they are in its possession;</p><p>23. A licensee may require a borrower to purchase or maintain property insurance upon a motor vehicle securing a title loan made pursuant to this chapter. A licensee may not require the borrower to obtain such insurance from a particular provider; and</p><p>24. If a licensee or any person acting at its direction takes possession of a motor vehicle securing a title loan, the vehicle and any personal items in it shall be stored in a secure location.</p><p>2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0477'>477</a>, § 6.1-495; 2011, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0418'>418</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0501'>501</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1215'>1215</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1258'>1258</a>.</p>"

Respond to a written inquiry from a qualified education loan borrower or the representative of a qualified education loan borrower within 10 business days after receipt of the request and, within 30 business days after receipt of the request, provide information relating to the request and, if applicable, to the action the qualified education loan servicer will take to correct the account or an explanation for the qualified education loan servicer's position that the borrower's account is correct. Such 30-day period may be extended for not more than 15 days if, before the end of the 30-day period, the qualified education loan servicer notifies the borrower, or the borrower's representative, as applicable, of the extension and the reasons for the delay in responding;</p><p>3. Not furnish to a consumer reporting agency, during 60 days following receipt of a written request related to a dispute on a borrower's payment on a qualified education loan, information regarding a payment that is the subject of the written request;</p><p>4. Except as provided in federal law or required by a qualified education loan agreement, inquire of a borrower how to apply an overpayment to a qualified education loan. A borrower's direction on how to apply an overpayment to a qualified education loan shall remain in effect for any future overpayments during the term of a qualified education loan or until the borrower provides different directions. As used in this subdivision, \"overpayment\" means a payment on a qualified education loan that exceeds the monthly amount due from a borrower on the qualified education loan, which payment may be referred to as a prepayment;</p><p>5. Apply partial payments in a manner that minimizes late fees and negative credit reporting. If loans on a borrower's qualified education loan account have an equal level of delinquency, a qualified education loan servicer shall apply partial payments to satisfy as many individual loan payments as possible on a borrower's account. As used in this subdivision, \"partial payment\" means a payment on a qualified education loan account that contains multiple individual loans in an amount less than the amount necessary to satisfy the outstanding payment due on all loans in the qualified education loan account, which payment may be referred to as an underpayment;</p><p>6. Require, as a condition of a sale, an assignment, or any other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan, that the new loan servicer honor all benefits originally represented as available to a qualified education loan borrower during the repayment of the qualified education loan and preserve the availability of the benefits, including any benefits for which the qualified education loan borrower has not yet qualified. If a qualified education loan servicer is not also the loan holder or is not acting on behalf of the loan holder, the loan servicer satisfies the requirement of this subsection by providing the new loan servicer with information necessary for the new loan servicer to honor all benefits originally represented as available to a qualified education loan borrower during the repayment of the qualified education loan and preserve the availability of the benefits, including any benefits for which the loan borrower has not yet qualified; and</p><p>7. In the event of a sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan that results in a change in the identity of the person to whom a qualified education loan borrower is required to send payments or direct any communication concerning the qualified education loan:</p><p>a. Transfer to the new loan servicer all records regarding the qualified education loan borrower, the account of the loan borrower, and the qualified education loan of the loan borrower. Such records include the repayment status of the qualified education loan borrower and any benefits associated with the qualified education loan of the loan borrower. The transfer of records shall be completed within 45 days after the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan;</p><p>b. Notify affected qualified education loan borrowers of the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan at least seven days before the next payment on the loan is due. The notice shall include (i) the identity of the new qualified education loan servicer; (ii) the effective date of the transfer of the borrower's qualified education loan to the new loan servicer; (iii) the date on which the existing loan servicer will no longer accept payments; and (iv) the contact information for the new loan servicer; and</p><p>c. Adopt policies and procedures to verify that the new qualified education loan servicer has received all records regarding the qualified education loan borrower, the account of the qualified education loan borrower, and the qualified education loan of the borrower, including the repayment status of the qualified education loan borrower and any benefits associated with the qualified education loan of the borrower.</p><p>2020, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1198'>1198</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1250'>1250</a>.</p>"
