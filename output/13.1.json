        "Body": "<p>A. No certificate for membership or stock shall be issued until fully paid for, but promissory notes may be accepted by the association as full or partial payment. The association shall hold the stock as security for the payment of the note, but such retention as security shall not affect the member's right to vote and hold office.</p><p>Fractional shares may be issued by capital stock associations. Certificates representing shares and certificates of membership or other evidence of the patron's equity in any fund, capital investment or other assets of the association shall be signed by the president or a vice-president or treasurer or assistant treasurer and the secretary or an assistant secretary of the association, or by facsimiles of their signatures, and may be sealed with the seal of the association, or a facsimile thereof.</p><p>B. Certificates of membership of a nonstock association shall not be transferred without the consent of the association's board of directors.</p><p>C. Voting stock in capital stock associations shall not be transferable to persons not eligible to membership in the association and such restrictions must be set forth in the bylaws of each capital stock association and printed on every stock certificate subject thereto.</p><p>D. The board of directors of an association, from time to time, may declare and the association may pay dividends on the stock or membership capital except when the declaration or payment thereof would be contrary to any restrictions contained in the articles of incorporation.</p><p>E. Net savings (which are hereby defined as being the excess of receipts over costs and expenses for each year of operations) in excess of dividends on outstanding stock or membership capital and additions to reserves shall be distributed on the basis of patronage, and the books of the association shall provide the basis for determining the interest of members and other patrons in the reserves. The distribution of patronage refunds may be restricted to members or be made at the same or a different rate for members and nonmembers. The bylaws may provide that any distribution to a nonmember, eligible for membership may be credited to such nonmember, until the amount thereof equals the value of a membership certificate or a share of the association's voting stock.</p><p>F. After a member has notified the association of his withdrawal, or after the adoption of a resolution by the board terminating his membership, the board shall appraise the value in money of his membership interest in the association and shall determine and fix the time when the association shall pay him the value of his interest, unless the member, with the consent of the board, transfers his certificate of membership.</p><p>G. An association may issue nonvoting stock to members and nonmembers. Nonvoting stock may be redeemed or retired by the association on such terms and conditions as may be provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and printed on the stock certificates. Payment for nonvoting stock may be made in cash, services or property as determined by the board.</p><p>Voting stock may be issued only for money or notes or in payment of patronage refunds at par.</p><p>H. Except when its debts exceed fifty per centum of its assets, an association may purchase for cash its voting stock at book value or par value, whichever is less, and may call such stock for redemption on the same basis pursuant to a plan for rotating ownership of such stock set forth in its articles of incorporation or in its bylaws. The determination of book value by the board of directors shall be incontestable except for fraud.</p><p>I. The association may from time to time issue to each patron a certificate or other evidence of the patron's equity in any fund, capital investment or other assets of the association. Such certificate or other evidence of such equity may be transferred only to the association, or to such other purchaser as may be approved by the board of directors, upon such terms and conditions as shall be provided in the bylaws and printed thereon.</p><p>J. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when there is held by any association any membership or patronage equity, including but not limited to membership stock, patronage refunds, patronage refund allocations, or any credit or distribution attributable to business done with or for patrons, to the credit of a person who has not had a current address on file with the association for a period of not less than three consecutive years, then the bylaws or member agreements of the association may provide that such equity shall be deemed to have been transferred by forfeiture to the association and shall thereafter be the property of the association; however, such membership or patronage equity shall be deemed forfeited to the association only if (i) the association publishes conspicuous notice of such pending forfeiture in its regular member publication, if any, and a publication of general circulation and (ii) such equity is not claimed by such person or, if such person is deceased, such person's next of kin within 180 days of such publication or such longer period as set out in the bylaws or member agreements of the association. If there is no such provision in the association's bylaws or member agreements, or if there is no publication, then any unclaimed membership or patronage equity shall be treated in accordance with the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ <a href='/vacode/55.1-2500/'>55.1-2500</a> et seq.).</p><p>K. Any association organized with capital stock under this article may accept registrations of such stock in the names of two or more persons, payable to any one of them, or to any one of them or the survivor; and any person so named, whether the others be living or not, may accept dividend payments and withdraw from the association and receive the amount payable on withdrawal in the same manner and on the same terms as are allowed by law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws in case of any other member or stockholder and the receipt or acceptance of dividends or amounts payable on withdrawal by the person so paid shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge of the association for any payment so made.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 13-269, 13-270, 13-273 to 13-277; 1952, c. 166; 1956, c. 428; 1975, c. 403; 1981, c. 51; 2001, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0797'>797</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0838'>838</a>.</p>"

The prohibitions of this subdivision shall not apply to any transaction with a customer of a broker-dealer if such broker-dealer is not acting as an investment advisor in relation to such transaction, or</p><p>4. To engage in dishonest or unethical practices as the Commission may define by rule.</p><p>B.

Except as may be permitted by rule or order of the Commission, it shall be unlawful for any investment advisor to enter into, extend, or renew any investment advisory contract unless it provides in writing:</p><p>1. That the investment advisor shall not be compensated on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client;</p><p>2.

Any security whose issuer (which, for the purposes of this subsection, shall include any predecessor by merger, consolidation or acquisition of assets) has been in continuous operation for at least five years if there has been no default within the past three fiscal years in the payment of principal, interest or dividends on any security of the issuer with a fixed maturity or a fixed interest or dividend provision, and (where the security being registered does not have a fixed maturity or a fixed interest or dividend provision) (a) the issuer is a corporation which has assets of at least $500,000 after deduction of depreciation and other reserves, which has a net worth of at least $10,000, which is incorporated under the laws of this Commonwealth and which conducts a substantial portion of its business in this Commonwealth, or (b) the issuer during its past three fiscal years has had average net earnings applicable to all securities without a fixed maturity or a fixed interest or dividend provision (whether of one or more classes) outstanding at the date when the registration statement is filed (i) aggregating at least five percent of the amount of such outstanding securities as measured by their maximum public offering price or their market price on a day within 30 days of the date of filing the registration statement, whichever is higher, or their book value on a day within 90 days of the date of filing the registration statement if there is neither a readily determinable market price nor a public offering price or (ii) if no such securities are outstanding, then aggregating at least five percent of the amount of such securities then offered for sale based upon the maximum price at which such securities are to be offered for sale; and all accounting determinations required by this section shall be made in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices. Noncumulative preferred stock shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection a security with a fixed dividend provision.</p><p>2. Any security registered for nonissuer distribution if (i) any security of the same class has ever been registered or (ii) the security being registered was originally issued pursuant to an exemption in this chapter.</p><p>B. A registration statement under this section shall state the facts showing eligibility of the securities for registration by notification, the amount and maximum offering price of the securities proposed to be offered in this Commonwealth, and a copy of any prospectus to be used in connection with the offering.

The Commission may require that a prospectus be used in connection with the offering. If the Commission requires the use of a prospectus, it shall be unlawful to sell any security registered under this section except upon delivery of a prospectus to each person to whom an offer is made. The prospectus shall contain such information specified in subsection (b) of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-510/'>13.1-510</a> as may be designated by the Commission as necessary for the protection of investors and such additional information as the Commission may require.</p><p>1956, c. 428; 1981, c. 168; 1984, c. 771; 1993, c. 179; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0595'>595</a>.</p>"

The Commission may require that it also include the articles of incorporation and bylaws, any agreements with underwriters, any indenture or any other instrument governing the issuance of the security to be registered, a specimen of the security and any other information documents filed under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement shall be accompanied by a fee of one-twentieth of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price of the securities proposed to be offered in this Commonwealth; provided that the fee shall not be less than $200 nor more than $700, except that in the case of a unit investment trust, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fee shall not be less than $400 nor more than $1,000.</p><p>C. A registration statement under this section shall automatically become effective at the moment the federal registration statement becomes effective if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) No stop order is in effect and no proceeding for the issuance of a stop order is pending and (ii) the registration statement and all amendments other than a final amendment (hereinafter termed the \"price amendment\") which is limited substantially to information concerning the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, and other matters dependent upon the offering price have been on file with the Commission, or any entity designated by order or rule of the Commission, for at least three full business days. Unless the definitive information concerning price and other matters dependent thereon has been so on file with the Commission or such entity, the registrant shall promptly notify the Commission by telephone, telegram, or electronic means of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the federal price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file a post-effective amendment containing the information in the federal price amendment but exclusive of exhibits. Failure to receive such notification or such post-effective amendment if required shall be grounds for the entry of a stop order retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement, without notice or hearing, if the Commission promptly notifies the registrant by telephone, telegram, or electronic means (and promptly confirms by letter, telegram, or electronic means when it notifies by telephone) of the issuance of such an order. If the registrant proves that he complied with the requirements of this subsection as to notice and post-effective amendment, the stop order shall be void as of the time of its entry. The Commission may, by order, letter, telegram, or electronic means, accelerate the effectiveness of any registration statement and may waive any or all of the conditions specified in clause (ii) above. If the federal registration has become effective before all of such conditions have been satisfied and they are not so waived, the registration statement under this section shall automatically become effective as soon as all of such conditions have been satisfied.</p><p>1956, c. 428; 1984, c. 771; 1990, c. 90; 1994, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?941+ful+CHAP0010'>10</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0595'>595</a>.</p>"

The Commission may assess and collect in connection with any filing pursuant to this exemption a nonrefundable fee not to exceed $250;</p><p>20.

The aggregate price of securities in an offering under this exemption does not exceed $2 million, which sum the Commission, by rule or order, may increase or decrease;</p><p>d. The total consideration paid by any purchaser of securities in an offering under this exemption does not exceed $10,000, unless the purchaser is an accredited investor as defined by Rule 501 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation D (17 C.F.R. § 230.501). The Commission, by rule or order, may increase or decrease such limit on the total consideration to be paid by any purchaser of securities in an offering under this exemption;</p><p>e. No compensation is paid to employees, agents, or other persons for the solicitation of, or based on the sale of, securities in connection with an offering of securities under this exemption to any person who is not registered as a broker-dealer or agent, except to the extent permitted by rule or order of the Commission;</p><p>f. Neither the issuer nor any person related to the issuer is subject to disqualification as established by the Commission by rule or order; and</p><p>g.

However, for an offering conducted in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 147A, the entity issuing the security may be formed or organized outside the Commonwealth, provided that the entity has its principal place of business in the Commonwealth and satisfies at least one of the doing business requirements in 17 C.F.R. § 230.147A (c) 2.</p><p>The Commission may assess and collect in connection with any filing pursuant to this exemption a nonrefundable fee in an amount to be set by the Commission by rule or order, provided such amount shall not exceed $500;</p><p>22. Any offer or sale of securities conducted in accordance with Tier 2 of federal Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 to 230.263) promulgated under § 3(b)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-9741, 80 Fed.

        "Body": "<p>A. For purposes of this chapter, except for notice to or from the Commission:</p><p>1. A notice shall be in writing except that oral notice of any meeting of the board of directors may be given if expressly authorized by the articles of incorporation or bylaws.</p><p>2. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, words in a notice or other communication under this chapter shall be in the English language. A notice or other communication may be given by any method of delivery, except that electronic transmissions shall be in accordance with this section. If the methods of delivery are impracticable, a notice or other communication may be given by a broad non-exclusionary dissemination to the public, which may include a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the notice is intended to be given, or by radio, television, or other form of public communication in the area where the notice is intended to be given or other methods of distribution that the corporation has previously identified to its shareholders.</p><p>3. A notice or other communication to a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth may be delivered to the corporation's registered agent at its registered office or to the secretary at the corporation's principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authority.</p><p>4. A notice or other communication may be delivered by electronic transmission if consented to by the recipient or if otherwise authorized by subsection B.</p><p>5. Any consent under subdivision 4 may be revoked by the person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmissions given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications; however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p><p>6. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic transmission is received when:</p><p>a. It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions or information of the type sent, and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic transmission; and</p><p>b. It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</p><p>7. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subdivision 6 a establishes that an electronic transmission was received. However, such receipt of an electronic acknowledgment, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.</p><p>8. An electronic transmission is received under this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.</p><p>9. A notice or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is effective at the earliest of the following:</p><p>a. If in physical form, the earliest of when it is actually received or when it is left at:</p><p>(1) A shareholder's address shown on the corporation's record of shareholders maintained by the corporation pursuant to subsection C of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-770/'>13.1-770</a>;</p><p>(2) A director's residence or usual place of business;</p><p>(3) The corporation's principal office; or</p><p>(4) The corporation's registered office when left with the corporation's registered agent;</p><p>b. If mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a shareholder, upon deposit in the United States mail;</p><p>c. If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient other than a shareholder, the earliest of when it is actually received or: (i) if sent by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, the date shown on the return receipt, signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (ii) five days after it is deposited in the United States mail;</p><p>d. If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subdivision 7; and</p><p>e. If oral, when communicated.</p><p>10. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if (i) the electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form, and (ii) the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.</p><p>B. If this chapter prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements govern. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize or require delivery of notices of meetings of directors by electronic transmission.</p><p>C. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to shareholders, any notice to shareholders given by a public corporation, under any provision of this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, shall be effective if given in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided that the corporation has first received any affirmative written consent or implied consent required under those rules and regulations.</p><p>D. If any provisions of this chapter are deemed to modify, limit, or supersede the federal General Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq., the provisions of this chapter shall control to the maximum extent permitted by § 102(a)(2) of that federal act or any successor provision of that federal act.</p><p>E. Whenever notice would otherwise be required to be given under any provision of this chapter to a shareholder, the notice need not be given if:</p><p>1. Notices to shareholders of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings during the period between two consecutive annual meetings, have been sent, other than by electronic transmission, to such shareholder at such shareholder's address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable or could not be delivered; or</p><p>2. All, but not less than two, distributions to shareholders during a 12-month period, or two consecutive distributions to shareholders during a period of more than 12 months, have been sent to such shareholder at such shareholder's address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable or could not be delivered.</p><p>If any shareholder, for which notice is not required, delivers to the corporation a written notice setting forth such shareholder's then-current address, the requirement that notice be given shall be reinstated.</p><p>1985, c. 522; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0285'>285</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0728'>728</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0165'>165</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0782'>782</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1226'>1226</a>; 2021, Sp.

No corporation organized under this chapter to conduct the business of a public service company shall have general business powers in this Commonwealth. Corporations organized under this chapter to conduct the business of a public service company may, however, conduct in this Commonwealth other public service business or nonpublic service business so far as may be related to or incidental to its stated business as a public service company and in any other state such business as may be authorized or permitted by the laws thereof.

A requirement that if the corporation solicits proxies or consents with respect to an election of directors, the corporation include in its proxy statement and any form of its proxy or consent, to the extent and subject to such procedures or conditions as are provided in the bylaws, one or more individuals nominated by a shareholder in addition to individuals nominated by the board of directors; and</p><p>2. A requirement that any or all internal corporate claims shall be brought exclusively in a circuit court or a federal district court in the Commonwealth and, if so specified, in any additional courts in the Commonwealth or in any other jurisdictions in which the corporation maintains its principal office.

A provision of the bylaws adopted under subdivision C 2 shall not have the effect of conferring jurisdiction on any court or over any person or claim, and shall not apply if none of the courts specified by such provision has the requisite personal and subject matter jurisdiction. If the court or courts specified in a provision adopted under subdivision C 2 do not have the requisite personal and subject matter jurisdiction and another court of the Commonwealth does have such jurisdiction, then the internal corporate claim may be brought in such other court of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that such other court of the Commonwealth is not specified in such provision, and in any other court specified in such provision that has the requisite jurisdiction. No provision of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws may prohibit bringing an internal corporate claim in the courts of the Commonwealth or require any such claim to be determined by arbitration.</p><p>E.

One or more officers of the corporation present at a meeting of the board of directors may be deemed by a majority of the directors present at the meeting to be directors for the meeting, in order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, as necessary to achieve a quorum.</p><p>C. During such an emergency, the board of directors, or, if a quorum cannot be readily convened for a meeting, a majority of the directors present, may:</p><p>1. Take any action that it determines to be practical and necessary to address circumstances of the emergency with respect to a meeting of shareholders notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, including (i) to postpone any such meeting to a later time or date, with the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting applying to the postponed meeting irrespective of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-660/'>13.1-660</a>, unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, and (ii) with respect to a corporation subject to the reporting requirements of § 13(a) or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to notify shareholders of any postponement, a change of the place of the meeting, or a change to hold the meeting solely by means of remote communication pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-660.2/'>13.1-660.2</a> solely by a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to § 13, 14, or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and</p><p>2.

Such notice, in the case of a corporation subject to the reporting requirements of § 13(a) or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may be given solely by a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to § 13, 14, or 15(d) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</p><p>No person shall be liable and no meeting of shareholders shall be postponed or voided for the failure to make a list of shareholders available pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-661/'>13.1-661</a> if it was not practicable to allow inspection during such an emergency.</p><p>D. Corporate action taken in good faith during such an emergency under this section to further the ordinary business affairs of the corporation:</p><p>1. Binds the corporation; and</p><p>2. May not be used to impose liability on a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation.</p><p>1985, c. 522; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2021, Sp.

The board of directors may fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution. If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, the record date is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.</p><p>C. No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:</p><p>1. The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or</p><p>2. The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.</p><p>D. The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection C either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. For any public corporation, reliance upon the most recent financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States shall be deemed to be reasonable in the circumstances if the financial statements have been audited by independent certified public accountants whose certification does not include a going concern qualification.</p><p>E. Except as provided in subsection G, the effect of a distribution under subsection C is measured:</p><p>1. In the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date cash or other property is transferred or debt to a shareholder incurred by the corporation or (ii) the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;</p><p>2. In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and</p><p>3. In all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or (ii) the date payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</p><p>F. A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.</p><p>G. Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection C if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If such indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.</p><p>H.

Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, in which case no action by the board of directors shall be required. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents bearing the date of signature and describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action and delivered to the corporation's secretary for filing by the corporation with the minutes of the meeting or corporate records.</p><p>B. The articles of incorporation may authorize action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent, provided that the taking of such action is consistent with any requirements that may be set forth in the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or this section; however, unless the articles of incorporation of a public corporation authorized action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent as of April 1, 2018, the shareholders of the public corporation shall not be entitled to act by less than unanimous written consent even if so authorized by the articles of incorporation if the articles of incorporation or bylaws of such public corporation allow the holders of 30 percent or fewer of all votes entitled to be cast to demand the calling of a special meeting of shareholders. For action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent to be valid:</p><p>1. It shall be an action that this chapter requires or permits to be taken at a shareholders' meeting;</p><p>2. The articles of incorporation shall authorize action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent and, if a public corporation at the time of such authorization in addition to the other limitations in this subsection B, the inclusion of the authorization in the articles of incorporation was approved by each voting group entitled to vote by the greater of:</p><p>a. The vote of that voting group required by the articles of incorporation to amend the articles of incorporation; or</p><p>b. More than two-thirds of all votes that the voting group is entitled to cast on the amendment;</p><p>3. At least 10 days before the holders of more than 10 percent of the outstanding shares of any voting group entitled to vote on the action to be taken have signed the written consent, the corporation's secretary shall have received a copy of the form of written consent setting forth the action to be taken;</p><p>4. If required by this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, the board of directors shall have approved this action; and</p><p>5. The holders of not less than the minimum number of outstanding shares of each voting group entitled to vote on the action that would be required to take the action at a shareholders' meeting at which all shares of each voting group entitled to vote on the action were present and voted shall have signed written consents setting forth the action to be taken.</p><p>C.

If not otherwise fixed under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-656/'>13.1-656</a> or <a href='/vacode/13.1-660/'>13.1-660</a> and if prior action by the board of directors is not required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation's secretary. If not otherwise fixed under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-656/'>13.1-656</a> or <a href='/vacode/13.1-660/'>13.1-660</a> and if prior action by the board of directors is required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day the action of the board is taken. No written consent shall be effective to take the action referred to in such consent unless, within 60 days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered to the corporation's secretary as required by this section was signed, written consents signed by the holders of shares having sufficient votes to take the corporate action have been delivered to the corporation's secretary. A written consent may be revoked by a writing to that effect delivered to the corporation's secretary before unrevoked written consents sufficient in number to take the corporate action are delivered to the corporation.</p><p>E. A consent signed pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any document. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors provides for a reasonable delay to permit tabulation of written consents, the action taken by written consent shall be effective when (i) written consents signed by the holders of shares having sufficient votes to adopt or take the action are delivered to the corporation's secretary or (ii) if an effective date is specified therein, as of such date provided such consent states the date of execution by the consenting shareholder.</p><p>F. For purposes of this section, a written consent and the signing thereof may be accomplished by one or more electronic transmissions.</p><p>G. Any person, whether or not then a shareholder, may provide that a consent in writing as a shareholder shall be effective at a future time, including the time when an event occurs, but such future time shall not be more than 60 days after such provision is made. Any such consent shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of this section at the future time so specified for the consent to be effective, provided that (i) the person is a shareholder at such future time and (ii) the person did not revoke the consent prior to such future time. Any such consent may be revoked, in the manner provided in subsection D, prior to its becoming effective.</p><p>H. If this chapter requires that notice of a proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action not more than 10 days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation's secretary, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection E. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this chapter, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.</p><p>I. If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonconsenting voting shareholders written notice of the action not more than 10 days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation's secretary or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection E. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material, that under any provision of this chapter, would have been required to be sent to voting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.</p><p>J. The notice requirements in subsections H and I shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent, and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a failure to give such notice within the required time period.</p><p>Code 1950, § 13.1-28; 1956, c. 428; 1985, c. 522; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0416'>416</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0728'>728</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0165'>165</a>; 2008, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0091'>91</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0782'>782</a>; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0706'>706</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>; 2018, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0267'>267</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0308'>308</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1226'>1226</a>.</p>"

After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. If the board of directors fixes a different record date under subsection E of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-660/'>13.1-660</a> to determine the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, a corporation also shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting. A list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Nothing contained in this subsection shall require the corporation to include on such list the electronic mail address or other electronic contact information of a shareholder.</p><p>B. The shareholders' list for notice shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, (i) at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the county or city where the meeting will be held or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the corporation. A shareholders' list for voting shall be similarly available for inspection promptly after the record date for voting. The original share transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be open to such inspection during the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.</p><p>D. If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder or the shareholder's agent or attorney to inspect a shareholders' list before or at the meeting, or to copy a list as permitted by subsection B, the circuit court of the county or city where the corporation's principal office, or if none in the Commonwealth its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.</p><p>E.

Only shares are entitled to vote.</p><p>B. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, in the election of directors each outstanding share, regardless of class or series, is entitled to one vote for as many persons as there are directors to be elected at that time and for whose election the shareholder has a right to vote.</p><p>C. Redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after delivery of written notice of redemption is effective and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company, or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares.</p><p>D. Shares of a corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned directly or indirectly through an entity of which a majority of the voting power is held directly or indirectly by the corporation or that is otherwise controlled by the corporation.</p><p>E. If a corporation holds in a fiduciary capacity its own shares directly, or indirectly through an entity of which a majority of the voting power is held directly or indirectly by the corporation or that is otherwise controlled by the corporation, such shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding and entitled to vote unless:</p><p>1. The corporation has authority to vote the shares only in accordance with directions of the principal or beneficiary; or</p><p>2. A co-fiduciary exists, pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/6.2-1011/'>6.2-1011</a> or otherwise, in which event the co-fiduciary may vote the shares.</p><p>F. Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officers, agent, or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.</p><p>G. Shares standing in the name of a partnership may be voted by any partner. Shares standing in the name of a limited liability company may be voted as the articles of organization or an operating agreement may prescribe, or in the absence of any such provision as the managers, or if there are no managers, the members of the limited liability company may determine.</p><p>H. Shares held by three or fewer persons as joint tenants or tenants in common or tenants by the entirety may be voted by any of such persons. If more than one of such tenants votes such shares, the vote shall be divided among them in proportion to the number of such tenants voting.</p><p>I. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, committee, or curator representing the shareholder may be voted by such person without a transfer of such shares into such person's name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, but no trustee is entitled to vote shares held by the trustee without a transfer of such shares into the trustee's name.</p><p>J. Shares standing in the name of a receiver or a trustee in proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 may be voted by such person. Shares held by or under the control of a receiver or a trustee in proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 may be voted by such person without the transfer thereof into such person's name if authority to do so is contained in an order of the court by which such person was appointed.</p><p>K. Nothing herein contained shall prevent trustees or other fiduciaries holding shares registered in the name of a nominee pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/6.2-1010/'>6.2-1010</a> from causing such shares to be voted by such nominee as the trustee or other fiduciary may direct. Such nominee may vote shares as directed by a trustee or other fiduciary without the necessity of transferring the shares to the name of the trustee or other fiduciary.</p><p>L. A shareholder whose shares are pledged is entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee is entitled to vote the shares so transferred.</p><p>M. The articles of incorporation may provide that the holders of bonds or debentures shall be entitled to vote on specified matters and such right shall not be terminated except upon consent of the holders of two-thirds in aggregate principal amount.</p><p>N. Subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-665/'>13.1-665</a>, when shares are held by more than one of the fiduciaries referred to in this section, the shares shall be voted as determined by a majority of such fiduciaries, except that (i) if they are equally divided as to a vote, the vote of the shares is divided equally and (ii) if only one of such fiduciaries is present in person or by proxy at a meeting, the fiduciary shall be entitled to vote all the shares. A proxy apparently executed by one of several of such fiduciaries shall be presumed to be valid until challenged and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 13-192 to 13-198, 13-203, 13.1-32; 1956, c. 428; 1958, c. 564; 1975, c. 500; 1984, c. 366; 1985, c. 522; 1990, c. 267; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0801'>801</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of:</p><p>1. A pledgee;</p><p>2. A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares;</p><p>3.

An appointment made irrevocable under subsection D is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished.</p><p>G. Unless it otherwise provides, an appointment made irrevocable under subsection D continues in effect after a transfer of the shares and a transferee takes subject to the appointment, except that a transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when acquiring the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates.</p><p>H.

The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;</p><p>2. The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, committee, or curator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment;</p><p>3. The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment;</p><p>4. The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder has been presented with respect to the vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; or</p><p>5. Three or fewer persons are the shareholder as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the co-owners.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions B 2 and B 5, in any case in which the will, trust agreement, or other instrument under which a fiduciary purports to act contains directions for the voting of shares in any corporation, or for the execution and delivery of proxies for the voting thereof, such directions shall be binding upon the fiduciary and upon the corporation if a copy thereof has been furnished to the corporation.</p><p>D. The corporation is entitled to reject a vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the person authorized to accept or reject such instrument or count votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.</p><p>E. Neither the corporation nor the person authorized to count votes, including an inspector of election under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-664.1/'>13.1-664.1</a>, that accepts or rejects a vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section or subsection B of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-663/'>13.1-663</a> is liable in damages to the shareholder for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.</p><p>F. Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a vote, ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.</p><p>G. If an inspector of election has been appointed under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-664.1/'>13.1-664.1</a>, the inspector of election also has the authority to request information and make determinations under subsections A, B, C, and D.</p><p>H. If authorized by the board of directors, any shareholder vote to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be voted upon by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission by the shareholder or the shareholder's proxy, provided that any such electronic transmission shall either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder or the shareholder's proxy. A share that is voted by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission as permitted by this subsection is deemed present at the shareholders' meeting.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 13-193 to 13-198, 13-203, 13.1-32; 1956, c. 428; 1958, c. 564; 1975, c. 500; 1984, c. 366; 1985, c. 522; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

        "Body": "<p>A. Except where shareholder approval of an amendment of the articles of incorporation is not required by this chapter, an amendment of the articles of incorporation shall be adopted in the following manner:</p><p>1. The proposed amendment shall first be adopted by the board of directors.</p><p>2. After adopting the proposed amendment the board of directors shall submit the amendment to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also recommend that the shareholders approve the amendment, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination; and</p><p>3. The shareholders entitled to vote on the amendment shall approve the amendment as provided in subsection D.</p><p>B. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the amendment by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the amendment.</p><p>C. If shareholder approval is to be sought at a shareholders' meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders' meeting in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/13.1-658/'>13.1-658</a>. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the amendment and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy of the amendment.</p><p>D. Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection B, requires a greater vote, approval of the amendment requires the approval of each voting group entitled to vote on the amendment by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote on the amendment at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p><p>E. If as a result of an amendment of the articles of incorporation one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new interest holder liability, approval of the amendment requires the signing in connection with the amendment, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such new interest holder liability, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has interest holder liability the terms and conditions of the new interest holder liability (i) are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability or (ii) are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability other than changes that eliminate or reduce such interest holder liability.</p><p>F. For purposes of subsection E, \"new interest holder liability\" means interest holder liability of a person resulting from an amendment of the articles of incorporation if (i) the person did not have interest holder liability before the amendment becomes effective or (ii) the person had interest holder liability before the amendment becomes effective, the terms and conditions of which are changed when the amendment becomes effective.</p><p>G. When an exchange, reclassification, or change of shares is effected by amendment of the articles of incorporation, and a material difference in right results, or the corporate name is changed, the action of the board of directors or shareholders authorizing the amendment may prescribe a time after which the holders of the old shares shall no longer be entitled to receive distributions or to vote or to exercise any other rights as shareholders until certificates, if any, representing the old shares are surrendered in exchange for certificates representing the new shares. But upon such surrender all distributions not paid because of this provision shall be paid without interest.</p><p>H. An amendment of the articles of incorporation may be further amended prior to the effective date of the certificate of amendment of the articles of incorporation; however, if the shareholders of the corporation are required by any provision of this chapter or the articles of incorporation to vote on the amendment of the articles of incorporation, the amendment of the articles of incorporation may not be further amended subsequent to approval of the amendment by such shareholders without the approval of the shareholders.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 13-37, 13.1-19, 13.1-56; 1956, c. 428; 1972, c. 580; 1975, c. 500; 1985, c. 522; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

Subject to the provisions of subdivision F 4, in the case of a domestic corporation that is (i) a party to a merger, (ii) an acquired entity in a share exchange, or (iii) the acquiring entity in a share exchange:</p><p>1.

The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan or, in the case of an offer referred to in subsection G, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.</p><p>B. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of merger or share exchange.</p><p>C. If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity and its shareholders are to receive shares or other eligible interests or the right to receive shares or other eligible interests in the survivor, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or organic rules of the survivor. If the corporation is to be merged into a domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity and a new domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or organic rules of the new corporation or eligible entity.</p><p>D. Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection B, require a greater vote, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the approval of each voting group entitled to vote on the plan by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the plan by each voting group entitled to vote on the plan of merger or share exchange at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p><p>E. Separate voting by voting groups is required:</p><p>1. Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, on a plan of merger by each class or series of shares that:</p><p>a. Is to be converted under the plan of merger into shares, other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or eligible interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, or is proposed to be eliminated without being converted into any of the foregoing; or</p><p>b. Would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under § <a href='/vacode/13.1-708/'>13.1-708</a>;</p><p>2. Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, on a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group;</p><p>3. On a plan of merger, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger; and</p><p>4. On a plan of share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of share exchange.</p><p>F. Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation's shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange is not required if:</p><p>1. The corporation will survive the merger or is the acquiring corporation in a share exchange;</p><p>2. Except for amendments permitted by § <a href='/vacode/13.1-706/'>13.1-706</a>, its articles of incorporation will not be changed;</p><p>3. Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger or share exchange will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, limitations, and rights immediately after the effective time of the merger or share exchange; and</p><p>4. With respect to shares of the surviving corporation in a merger or the shares of the acquiring entity in a share exchange entity that are entitled to vote unconditionally in the election of directors, the number of shares outstanding immediately after the merger or share exchange, plus the number of shares issuable as a result of the merger or share exchange, either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or share exchange or the exercise of options, rights, and warrants issued pursuant to the merger or share exchange, will not exceed by more than 20 percent the total number of shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately before the merger or share exchange.</p><p>G. Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation's shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange is not required if:</p><p>1. The plan of merger or share exchange expressly (i) permits or requires such a merger or share exchange to be effected under this subsection and (ii) provides that such merger or share exchange be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the offer referred to in subdivision 3 if such merger or share exchange is effected under this subsection;</p><p>2. Another party to the merger, the acquiring entity in the share exchange, or a parent of another party to the merger or the acquiring entity in the share exchange, makes an offer to purchase, on the terms provided in the plan of merger or share exchange, any and all of the outstanding shares of the corporation that, absent this subsection, would be entitled to vote on the plan of merger or share exchange, except that the offer may exclude shares of the corporation that are owned at the commencement of the offer by the corporation, the offeror, or any parent of the offeror, or by any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing;</p><p>3. The offer discloses that the plan of merger or share exchange provides that the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the requirement set forth in subdivision 6 and that the shares of the corporation that are not tendered in response to the offer will be treated as set forth in subdivision 8;</p><p>4. The offer remains open for at least 10 business days;</p><p>5. The offeror purchases all shares properly tendered in response to the offer and not properly withdrawn;</p><p>6. The shares listed below are collectively entitled to cast at least the minimum number of votes on the merger or share exchange that, absent this subsection, would be required by this chapter and by the articles of incorporation for the approval of the merger or share exchange by the shareholders and by any other voting group entitled to vote on the merger or share exchange at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the approval were present and voted:</p><p>a. Shares purchased by the offeror in accordance with the offer;</p><p>b. Shares otherwise owned by the offeror or by any parent of the offeror or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing; and</p><p>c. Shares subject to an agreement that they are to be transferred, contributed, or delivered to the offeror, any parent of the offeror, or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the foregoing in exchange for shares or eligible interests in such offeror, parent, or subsidiary;</p><p>7. The offeror or a wholly owned subsidiary of the offeror merges with or into, or effects a share exchange in which it acquires shares of, the corporation; and</p><p>8. Each outstanding share of each class or series of shares of the corporation that the offeror is offering to purchase in accordance with the offer, and that is not purchased in accordance with the offer, is to be converted in the merger into, or into the right to receive, or is to be exchanged in the share exchange for, or for the right to receive, the same amount and kind of securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights, cash, or other property to be paid or exchanged in accordance with the offer for each share of that class or series of shares that is tendered in response to the offer, except that shares of the corporation that are owned by the corporation or that are described in subdivision 6 a or c need not be converted into or exchanged for the consideration described in this subdivision.</p><p>H. As used in subsections G and K:</p><p>\"Offer\" means the offer referred to in subdivision 3.</p><p>\"Offeror\" means the person making the offer.</p><p>\"Parent\" of any entity means a person that owns, directly or indirectly, through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares or eligible interests in that entity.</p><p>\"Wholly owned subsidiary\" of a person means an entity of or in which that person owns, directly or indirectly, through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares or eligible interests.</p><p>I. If a corporation has not yet issued shares and its articles of incorporation do not otherwise provide, its board of directors may adopt and approve a plan of merger or share exchange on behalf of the corporation without shareholder action.</p><p>J. If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new interest holder liability, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the signing in connection with the transaction, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such new interest holder liability, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has interest holder liability with respect to such domestic corporation, (i) the new interest holder liability is with respect to a domestic or foreign corporation, which may be a different or the same domestic corporation in which the person is a shareholder, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the new interest holder liability are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability, other than for changes that eliminate or reduce such interest holder liability.</p><p>K. Shares tendered in response to an offer shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection G, to have been purchased in accordance with the offer at the earliest time as of which the offeror has irrevocably accepted those shares for payment and either (i) in the case of shares represented by certificates, the offeror, or the offeror's designated depository or other agent, has physically received the certificates representing those shares or (ii) in the case of shares without certificates, those shares have been transferred into the account of the offeror or its designated depository or other agent, or an agent's message relating to those shares has been received by the offeror or its designated depository or other agent.</p><p>Code 1950, § 13.1-70; 1956, c. 428; 1975, c. 500; 1985, c. 522; 1991, c. 109; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2006, cc. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0363'>363</a>, <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0663'>663</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0165'>165</a>; 2010, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0782'>782</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1226'>1226</a>; 2021, Sp.

        "Title": "Formation of a holding company.",
        "Body": "<p>A. As used in this section:</p><p>\"Constituent corporation\" means a corporation which, from the incorporation of the holding company until consummation of a merger governed by this section, was at all times the sole direct parent of the holding company and whose shares are converted into shares of the holding company in such merger.</p><p>\"Holding company\" means a corporation which, from its incorporation until consummation of a merger governed by this section, was at all times a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation and whose shares are issued in such merger in exchange for the shares of the constituent corporation.</p><p>\"Indirect subsidiary\" means a corporation which, from its incorporation until consummation of a merger governed by this section, was at all times a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company.</p><p>B. Unless its articles of incorporation otherwise provide, a constituent corporation may merge an indirect subsidiary into itself, or may merge itself into an indirect subsidiary, without the approval of the shareholders of the constituent corporation or the board of directors or shareholders of the indirect subsidiary, if:</p><p>1. Such constituent corporation and indirect subsidiary are the only parties to the merger;</p><p>2. The provisions in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the constituent corporation and the holding company immediately before the effective time of the merger are identical as they relate to:</p><p>a. The designation, number, and par value of each class and series of shares that are authorized, and the preferences, rights, and limitations of each class and series of shares;</p><p>b. Any terms of the shares that are dependent upon facts objectively ascertainable outside of the articles of incorporation or that vary among the holders of the same class or series;</p><p>c. The preemptive right of the shareholders to acquire unissued shares, provided, however, that if the constituent corporation was formed on or before December 31, 2005, and its articles of incorporation do not deny the preemptive right of its shareholders, and the holding company was formed after December 31, 2005, the articles of incorporation of the holding company must provide that its shareholders have the preemptive right to acquire the holding company's unissued shares to the same extent the shareholders of the constituent corporation had a preemptive right to acquire unissued shares of the constituent corporation;</p><p>d. The definition, limitation, and regulation of the powers of the corporation, its directors, and shareholders;</p><p>e. The management of the business and regulation of the affairs of the corporation; and</p><p>f. For purposes of subdivision 2 c, shares include any warrants, rights, or options to acquire any such shares or any security or other obligation of the corporation convertible into any such shares or into warrants, rights, or options to acquire any such shares;</p><p>3. Each share or fraction of a share of the constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger is converted in the merger into a share or equal fraction of a share of the holding company having the same preferences, rights, and limitations as the share or fraction of a share of the constituent corporation being converted in the merger;</p><p>4. Each right to acquire shares of the constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger is converted in the merger into a right to acquire shares of the holding company having the same preferences, rights, and limitations as the right to acquire shares of the constituent corporation being converted in the merger; and</p><p>5. The directors of the constituent corporation become or remain the directors of the holding company upon the effective time of the merger.</p><p>C. Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, a plan of merger adopted pursuant to this section may include:</p><p>1. If the indirect subsidiary is the survivor:</p><p>a. An amendment or restatement of the indirect subsidiary's articles of incorporation to change the name of the indirect subsidiary to a name that satisfies the requirements of this chapter; and</p><p>b. A provision that the shares of the holding company into which the shares of the constituent corporation are converted in the merger may be represented by the share certificates that previously represented shares of the constituent corporation, if the holding company adopts the former name of the constituent corporation by filing articles of amendment that are effective immediately following consummation of the merger; and</p><p>2. If the constituent corporation is the survivor:</p><p>a. An amendment or restatement of the constituent corporation's articles of incorporation:</p><p>(1) To change the name of the constituent corporation to a name that satisfies the requirements of this chapter;</p><p>(2) To delete any existing provisions that authorize the issuance of or relate to multiple classes or series of shares and to add one or more provisions that authorize a new, single class of shares with unlimited voting rights in lieu thereof;</p><p>(3) To delete any existing provision that provides for staggering the terms of directors pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-678/'>13.1-678</a>; or</p><p>(4) To make any change permitted by § <a href='/vacode/13.1-706/'>13.1-706</a>;</p><p>b. A provision that one or more of the directors of the constituent corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will no longer be directors of the constituent corporation immediately following the effective time of the merger; and</p><p>c. A provision that the shares of the holding company into which the shares of the constituent corporation are converted in the merger may be represented by the share certificates that previously represented shares of the constituent corporation, if the constituent corporation adopts a new name in the merger that is distinguishable upon the records of the Commission and if the board of directors of the holding company, acting pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/13.1-706/'>13.1-706</a>, adopts the former name of the constituent corporation by filing articles of amendment that are effective immediately following consummation of the merger.</p><p>D. Articles of merger filed with respect to a merger authorized by this section shall include a statement that the plan of merger did not require approval by the shareholders of the constituent corporation or by the board of directors or shareholders of the indirect subsidiary because the merger was authorized by this section and that the conditions specified in subsection B have been satisfied.</p><p>E. Except as provided in this section, a merger governed by this section shall comply with the provisions of this article applicable to mergers generally.</p><p>F. From and after the effective time of a merger adopted by a constituent corporation pursuant to this section:</p><p>1. To the extent the restrictions of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-725.1/'>13.1-725.1</a> or <a href='/vacode/13.1-728.2/'>13.1-728.2</a> applied to the constituent corporation and its shareholders immediately prior to the merger, such restrictions shall apply to the holding company and its shareholders immediately after the effective time of the merger as though it were the constituent corporation, and all shares of the holding company acquired in the merger shall for purposes of §§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-725.1/'>13.1-725.1</a> and <a href='/vacode/13.1-728.2/'>13.1-728.2</a> be deemed to have been acquired at the time that the shares of the constituent corporation converted in the merger were acquired, and provided further that:</p><p>a. Any shareholder who immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was not an interested shareholder within the meaning of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-725/'>13.1-725</a> shall not solely by reason of the merger become an interested shareholder of the holding company; and</p><p>b. Any shares which immediately prior to the effective time of the merger were not interested shares within the meaning of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-728.1/'>13.1-728.1</a> shall not solely by reason of the merger become interested shares of the holding company.</p><p>2. To the extent a shareholder of the constituent corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the merger had standing to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding on behalf of the constituent corporation, consummation of the merger shall not be deemed to limit or extinguish such standing.</p><p>3. To the extent a voting trust authorized by § <a href='/vacode/13.1-670/'>13.1-670</a>, a voting agreement authorized by § <a href='/vacode/13.1-671/'>13.1-671</a>, a shareholder agreement authorized by § <a href='/vacode/13.1-671.1/'>13.1-671.1</a>, a proxy or any similar agreement or instrument applied to the constituent corporation, its shares or its shareholders immediately prior to the merger, such voting trust, voting agreement, shareholder agreement, proxy or other agreement or instrument shall apply to the holding company and its shares and shareholders immediately following consummation of the merger to the same extent that it applied to the constituent corporation and its shares and shareholders immediately prior to consummation of the merger.</p><p>2006, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0363'>363</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

The domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is designated in the plan of merger as the survivor continues or comes into existence as the case may be;</p><p>2. The separate existence of every domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor ceases;</p><p>3. All property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that merges into the survivor is vested in the survivor without transfer, reversion or impairment;</p><p>4. All debts, obligations, and liabilities of each domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor are debts, obligations, or liabilities of the survivor;</p><p>5. The name of the survivor may, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased in the merger;</p><p>6. If the survivor is a domestic corporation, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the survivor are amended to the extent provided in the plan of merger;</p><p>7. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of a survivor that is a domestic corporation created by the merger become effective;</p><p>8. The shares of each domestic or foreign corporation that is a party to the merger, and the eligible interests in a domestic or foreign eligible entity that is a party to the merger, that are to be converted under the plan of merger into shares, other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities, or eligible interests, cash, other property or any combination of the foregoing, are converted, and the former holders of such shares or eligible interests are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of merger or to any rights they may have under Article 15 (§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-729/'>13.1-729</a> et seq.) or the organic law governing the foreign corporation or domestic or foreign eligible entity;</p><p>9. Except as provided by law or the plan of merger, all the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities of each entity that was a party to the merger, other than the survivor, are the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities of the survivor; and</p><p>10. If the survivor existed before the merger:</p><p>a. All the property and contract rights of the survivor remain its property and contract rights without transfer, reversion, or impairment;</p><p>b. The survivor remains subject to all its debts, obligations, and other liabilities; and</p><p>c. Except as provided by law or the plan of merger, the survivor continues to hold all of its rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities.</p><p>B. When a share exchange becomes effective, the shares or eligible interests in the acquired entity that are to be exchanged for shares and other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities, eligible interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of share exchange or to any rights they may have under Article 15 (§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-729/'>13.1-729</a> et seq.) or under the organic law governing the acquired entity.</p><p>C. Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation of a domestic corporation or the organic law governing or organic rules of a foreign corporation or a domestic or foreign eligible entity, the effect of a merger or share exchange on interest holder liability is as follows:</p><p>1. A person who becomes subject to a new interest holder liability in respect of an entity as a result of a merger or share exchange shall have that new interest holder liability only in respect of interest holder liabilities that arise after the merger or share exchange becomes effective.</p><p>2. If a person had interest holder liability with respect to a party to the merger or the acquired entity before the merger or share exchange becomes effective with respect to shares or eligible interests of such party or acquired entity that were (i) exchanged in the merger or share exchange, (ii) were canceled in the merger, or (iii) the terms and conditions of which relating to interest holder liability were amended pursuant to the merger:</p><p>a. The merger or share exchange does not discharge that prior interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arose before the merger or share exchange becomes effective.</p><p>b. The provisions of the organic law governing any entity for which the person had that prior interest holder liability shall continue to apply to the collection or discharge of any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision C 2 a, as if the merger or share exchange had not occurred.</p><p>c. The person shall have such rights of contribution from other persons as are provided by the organic law governing the entity for which the person had that prior interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision C 2 a, as if the merger or share exchange had not occurred.</p><p>d. The person shall not, by reason of such prior interest holder liability, have interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arise after the merger or share exchange becomes effective.</p><p>3. If a person has interest holder liability both before and after a merger becomes effective with unchanged terms and conditions with respect to the entity that is the survivor by reason of owning the same shares or eligible interests before and after the merger becomes effective, the merger has no effect on such interest holder liability.</p><p>4. A share exchange has no effect on interest holder liability related to shares or eligible interests of the acquired entity that were not exchanged in the share exchange.</p><p>D. Upon a merger becoming effective, a foreign corporation or a foreign eligible entity that is the survivor of the merger is deemed to:</p><p>1. Appoint the clerk of the Commission as its agent for service of process in any proceeding (i) to enforce the rights of shareholders of each domestic corporation that was a party to the merger who exercise appraisal rights or (ii) based on a cause of action against a nonsurviving domestic corporation arising during the time it was in existence under the laws of the Commonwealth, which service of process shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/12.1-19.1/'>12.1-19.1</a>; and</p><p>2. Agree that it will promptly pay the amount, if any, to which such shareholders are entitled under Article 15 (§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-729/'>13.1-729</a> et seq.).</p><p>E. No corporation that is required by law to be a domestic corporation, may, by merger, cease to be a domestic corporation, but every such corporation, even though a corporation of some other state, the United States or another country, shall also be a domestic corporation of the Commonwealth.</p><p>F.

The plan of domestication shall first be adopted by the board of directors.</p><p>2. After adopting the plan of domestication the board of directors shall submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval.</p><p>In submitting the plan of domestication to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.</p><p>3. The board of directors may set conditions for approval of the plan of domestication by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of domestication.</p><p>4. If the approval of the shareholders is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of domestication is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of domestication and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.

A sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of the corporation's assets, other than a disposition described in § <a href='/vacode/13.1-723/'>13.1-723</a>, requires approval of the corporation's shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. The corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity if it retains a business activity that represented, for the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (i) at least 20 percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and (ii) at least 20 percent of either (a) income from continuing operations before taxes or (b) revenues from continuing operations, in each case for the most recently completed fiscal year.</p><p>B. A disposition that requires approval of the shareholders under subsection A shall be initiated by adoption of a resolution by the board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also submit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.</p><p>C. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of a disposition by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the disposition.</p><p>D. If a disposition is required to be approved by the shareholders and if the approval is to be sought at a shareholders' meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the shareholders' meeting at which the disposition is to be submitted for approval in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/13.1-658/'>13.1-658</a>. The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the agreement pursuant to which the disposition will be effected. If only a summary of the agreement is sent to shareholders, the corporation also shall send a copy of the agreement to any shareholder who requests it.</p><p>E. Unless the articles of incorporation or board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection C, requires a greater vote or a greater quorum, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require at a meeting at which a quorum exists the approval of the holders of more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the disposition. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the disposition by each voting group entitled to vote on the disposition at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p><p>F. Unless the parties to the disposition have agreed otherwise, after a disposition has been approved by the shareholders, and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of the parties to the disposition.</p><p>G. A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under Article 16 (§ <a href='/vacode/13.1-742/'>13.1-742</a> et seq.) is not governed by this section.</p><p>H. The assets of a direct or indirect consolidated subsidiary shall be deemed to be the assets of the parent corporation for the purposes of this section.</p><p>I. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no corporation organized to conduct the business of a railroad or other public service or a banking business, or a savings institution, an industrial loan association or a credit union may sell, lease or exchange its properties for the conduct of such business in the Commonwealth except to a corporation of the Commonwealth organized for the same purpose or in the case of a bank to a savings and loan association or a corporation of the United States, and in the case of a savings and loan association to a bank or a corporation of the United States.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 13-83, 13-84, 13.1-77; 1954, c. 499; 1956, c. 428; 1968, c. 109; 1971, Ex.

During such portion of the three-year period preceding the announcement date that such interested shareholder has been an interested shareholder, except as approved by a majority of the disinterested directors:</p><p>(1) There shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date therefor any full periodic dividends, whether or not cumulative, on any outstanding shares of the corporation;</p><p>(2) There shall have been (i) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on any class or series of voting shares, except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the class or series, and (ii) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification, including any reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction that has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of the class or series; and</p><p>(3) Such interested shareholder shall not have become the beneficial owner of any additional voting shares except as part of the transaction that results in such interested shareholder becoming an interested shareholder;</p><p>d. During such portion of the three-year period preceding the announcement date that such interested shareholder has been an interested shareholder, except as approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, such interested shareholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such affiliated transaction or otherwise; and</p><p>e. Except as otherwise approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, a proxy or information statement describing the affiliated transaction and complying with the requirements of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules, or regulations) is mailed to holders of voting shares of the corporation at least 25 days before the consummation of such affiliated transaction, whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act, rules, regulations, or subsequent provisions.</p><p>B. The provisions of this article do not apply to a particular affiliated transaction if the conditions specified in any one of the following subdivisions are met:</p><p>1. The affiliated transaction is with (i) an interested shareholder who has been an interested shareholder continuously or who would have been such but for the unilateral action of the corporation since the latest of (a) January 26, 1988, (b) the date the corporation first became subject to this article by virtue of its becoming a public corporation or having 300 shareholders of record, or (c) the date such person became an interested shareholder with the prior or contemporaneous approval of a majority of the disinterested directors, (ii) any person who becomes an interested shareholder as a result of acquiring shares from a person specified in (i) of this subdivision by gift, testamentary bequest or the laws of descent and distribution or in a transaction in which consideration was not exchanged and who continues thereafter to be an interested shareholder, or who would have so continued but for the unilateral action of the corporation, (iii) a person who became an interested shareholder inadvertently or as a result of the unilateral action of the corporation and who, as soon as practicable thereafter, divested beneficial ownership of sufficient shares so that such person ceased to be an interested shareholder, and who would not, at any time within the three-year period immediately preceding the announcement date have been an interested shareholder but for such inadvertency or the unilateral action of the corporation, or (iv) an interested shareholder whose acquisition of voting shares making such person an interested shareholder was approved by a majority of the disinterested directors prior to such shareholder's determination date.</p><p>2. The corporation (i) is not a public corporation and (ii) does not have more than 300 shareholders of record, unless its loss of that status results from action taken by or on behalf of an interested shareholder or a transaction in which a person becomes an interested shareholder.</p><p>3. The corporation is an investment company registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940.</p><p>4. The corporation's articles of incorporation initially filed with the Commission expressly provide that the corporation shall not be governed by this article and such provision in the articles of incorporation has not subsequently been amended to be eliminated.</p><p>5. The corporation, by action of its shareholders, adopts an amendment of its articles of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to be governed by this article, provided that, in addition to any other vote required by law, such amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws shall be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote that are not beneficially owned by an interested shareholder. An amendment adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall not be effective until 18 months after the date such amendment was approved by the shareholders and shall not apply to any affiliated transaction between the corporation and any person who became an interested shareholder of such corporation on or prior to the date of such amendment. A bylaw amendment adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall not be further amended by the board of directors. In the event the articles of incorporation or bylaws are subsequently amended to eliminate a prior amendment electing not to be governed by this article, such subsequent amendment shall not restrict an affiliated transaction between the corporation and any person who became an interested shareholder at a time after such prior amendment became effective and who continued to be an interested shareholder immediately before and immediately after the adoption of such subsequent amendment, provided such person thereafter remains an interested shareholder continuously, or would have so remained but for the unilateral action of the corporation.</p><p>1985, c. 522; 1988, c. 442; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person until the tendered shares are accepted for purchase or exchange. A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares as to which such person may exercise voting power solely by virtue of a revocable proxy conferring the right to vote. A member of a national securities exchange shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record holder of such securities and, pursuant to the rules of such exchange, may direct the vote of such shares, without instructions, on other than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the shares to be voted but is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instructions.</p><p>\"Control share acquisition\" means the direct or indirect acquisition, other than in an excepted acquisition, by any person of beneficial ownership of shares of a public corporation that, except for this article, would have voting rights and would, when added to all other shares of such public corporation which then have voting rights and are beneficially owned by such person, would cause such person to become entitled, immediately upon acquisition of such shares, to vote or direct the vote of, shares having voting power within any of the following ranges of the votes entitled to be cast in an election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third of such votes; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority of such votes; or (iii) a majority or more of such votes. If voting rights are granted pursuant to this article in respect of any such range to shares so acquired by any person, any acquisition by such person of additional shares shall not, for purposes of the preceding sentence, constitute a control share acquisition unless, as a result of such acquisition, the voting power of the shares beneficially owned by such person would be in excess of such range in respect of which voting rights had previously been granted. If this article applies to acquisitions of shares of a public corporation at the time of a control share acquisition of any shares of such corporation, then shares acquired by the same person within 90 days before or after such control share acquisition and shares acquired by the same person pursuant to a plan to make a control share acquisition are deemed to have been acquired in the same control share acquisition for the purposes of this article, regardless of the applicability of this article at the time of any other acquisitions of shares during such periods or pursuant to such a plan.</p><p>\"Excepted acquisition\" means the acquisition of shares of a public corporation in any of the following circumstances:</p><p>1. Before January 26, 1988;</p><p>2. Pursuant to a binding contract in effect before January 26, 1988;</p><p>3. Pursuant to the laws of wills and decedents' estates;</p><p>4.

Directly from the public corporation, or from any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, or from any corporation having beneficial ownership of shares of the public corporation having at least a majority, before such transaction, of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors of such public corporation; or</p><p>8. In good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter by or from any person (a \"transferor\") whose voting rights had previously been authorized by shareholders in compliance with this article, or whose previous acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares would have constituted a control share acquisition but for any of subdivisions 1 through 7 in this definition; however, any acquisition described in this subdivision 8 shall constitute a control share acquisition if as a result thereof any person acquires beneficial ownership of shares of such issuing public corporation having voting power in the election of directors in excess of the range of votes within which the transferor was authorized by this article to exercise voting power immediately before such acquisition.</p><p>\"Interested shares\" means the shares of a public corporation the voting of which in an election of directors may be exercised or directed by any of the following persons: (i) an acquiring person with respect to a control share acquisition; (ii) any officer of such public corporation; or (iii) any employee of such public corporation who is also a director of the corporation.</p><p>\"Person\" includes an associate of any person. For this purpose, \"associate\" shall mean (i) any other person who directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by or under common control with, any such person or who is acting or intends to act jointly or in concert with any such person in connection with the acquisition of or exercise of beneficial ownership over shares; (ii) any corporation or organization of which any such person is an officer, director, manager or partner or as to which any such person performs a similar function; (iii) any other person having direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of any class of equity securities of any such person; (iv) any trust or estate in which any such person has a beneficial interest or as to which any such person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (v) any relative or spouse of any such person, or any relative of such spouse, any one of whom has the same residence as any such person. For this purpose, \"control\" shall mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or to cause the direction of the management or policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, arrangement or understanding, or otherwise.</p><p>The \"votes\" entitled to be cast by any share shall, if any voting group is entitled to vote for less than the total number of directors to be elected at any election, be determined by multiplying the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holder of such share by the number of directors for whom such holder is entitled to vote; however, beneficial ownership of a majority of the shares comprising any such voting group shall be deemed to entitle such beneficial owner to cast all the votes of the shares in such voting group.</p><p>1989, c. 14; 1990, c. 252; 2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, in a proceeding under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> to dissolve a corporation, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.</p><p>B. An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within 90 days after the filing of the petition under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice shall state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and shall advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than 30 days after the effectiveness of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of outstanding shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the petitioner's shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.</p><p>C. If, within 60 days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.</p><p>D. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection C, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances. The determination of fair value shall include consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, including, unless the court determines it would be unjust or inequitable to do so, (i) the petitioner's minority status, (ii) the marketability of the petitioner's shares, (iii) the relevant terms of any shareholders' agreement, and (iv) if the court finds that the value of the corporation has been diminished by the wrongful conduct of controlling shareholders, the petitioner's proportionate claim for any compensable corporate injury. In determining the fair value, the court may, in its discretion, select an appraiser to appraise the fair value of the petitioner's shares and shall assess the cost of any such appraisal to the parties, to the corporation, or both, as the equities may appear to the court.</p><p>E. Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under subdivision A 1 b or d of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a>, it may award expenses to the petitioning shareholder.</p><p>F. Upon entry of an order under subsection C or E, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-747/'>13.1-747</a> and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court, which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.</p><p>G. The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection E shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final.</p><p>H. Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection C or E, other than an award of expenses pursuant to subsection E, is subject to the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/13.1-653/'>13.1-653</a>.</p><p>2005, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0765'>765</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0165'>165</a>; 2012, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0706'>706</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0734'>734</a>.</p>"

        "Body": "<p>A. A foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth may withdraw its certificate of authority by applying to the Commission for a certificate of withdrawal. The application shall be on a form prescribed and furnished by the Commission, which shall set forth:</p><p>1. The name of the foreign corporation and its jurisdiction of formation;</p><p>2. If applicable, a statement that the foreign corporation was a party to a merger permitted by the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and that it was not the surviving entity of the merger, has consolidated with another entity, or has converted to another type of entity under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation;</p><p>3. That the foreign corporation is not transacting business in the Commonwealth and that it surrenders its authority to transact business in the Commonwealth;</p><p>4. That the foreign corporation revokes the authority of its registered agent to accept service on its behalf and appoints the clerk of the Commission as an agent for service of process upon the foreign corporation in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time it was authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth;</p><p>5. A mailing address to which the clerk of the Commission may mail a copy of any process served on the clerk under subdivision 4; and</p><p>6.

The Commission shall not allow any foreign corporation to withdraw its certificate of authority unless such corporation files with the Commission a statement certifying that the corporation has filed returns and has paid all state taxes to the time of the statement or a statement that no such returns are required to be filed or taxes are required to be paid. In such case the corporation may file returns and pay taxes before they would otherwise be due. If the Commission finds that the application complies with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of withdrawal.</p><p>C. Before any foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth terminates its corporate existence, it shall file with the Commission an application for withdrawal. Whether or not such application is filed, the termination of the corporate existence of such foreign corporation shall not take away or impair any remedy available against such corporation for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to such termination. Any such action or proceeding against such foreign corporation may be defended by such corporation in its corporate name. The shareholders, directors and officers shall have power to take such corporate or other action as shall be appropriate to protect such remedy, right or claim.

At the discretion of the Commission, the annual registration fee due date for a corporation may be extended, on a monthly basis for a period of not less than one month nor more than 11 months, at the request of its registered agent of record or as may be necessary to distribute annual registration fee due dates of corporations as equally as practicable throughout the year on a monthly basis.</p><p>Any such corporation whose number of authorized shares is 5,000 or less shall pay an annual registration fee of $50.

In any year in which a corporation's annual registration fee due date is extended pursuant to subsection A, the annual registration fee assessment shall be increased by a prorated amount to cover the period of extension. A statement of the assessment, when made, shall be forwarded by the clerk of the Commission to the Comptroller and to each such corporation.</p><p>C.

If these methods of delivery are impracticable, a notice or other communication may be communicated by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the notice is intended to be given, or by radio, television, or other form of public communication in the area where notice is intended to be given.</p><p>C. Notice or other communication to a domestic or foreign corporation, authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth, may be delivered to its registered agent at its registered office or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authority.</p><p>D.

Any consent under subsection D may be revoked by the person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmissions given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or other person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications. The inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p><p>F.

A member's address shown on the corporation's record of members maintained by the corporation pursuant to subsection C of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-932/'>13.1-932</a>;</p><p>b. A director's residence or usual place of business;</p><p>c. The corporation's principal place of business; or</p><p>d. The corporation's registered office when left with the corporation's registered agent;</p><p>2. If mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a member, upon deposit in the United States mail;</p><p>3. If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient other than a member, the earliest of when it is actually received or: (i) if sent by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, the date shown on the receipt, signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (ii) five days after it is deposited in the mail;</p><p>4. If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subsection F; and</p><p>5. If oral, when communicated.</p><p>J. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if (i) the electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form and (ii) the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.</p><p>K. If this chapter prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements govern.

Eliminates the board of directors or, subject to the requirements of subsection A of § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-872/'>13.1-872</a>, one or more officers, or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors or any one or more officers;</p><p>2. Establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or their terms of office or manner of selection or removal;</p><p>3. Governs, in general or in regard to specific matters, the exercise or division of voting power by or between the members and directors or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies;</p><p>4. Establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any member, director, officer or employee of the corporation, or among any of them;</p><p>5. Transfers to one or more members, directors or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or members;</p><p>6. Requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of one or more of the members, or directors, in the case of a corporation that has no members or in which the members have no voting rights, or upon the occurrence of a specified event or contingency; or</p><p>7. Otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the members, the directors and the corporation, or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy.</p><p>B. An agreement authorized by this section shall be:</p><p>1. a. Set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are members or, if there are no members or the corporation's members do not have voting rights, by all persons who are directors at the time of the agreement; or</p><p>b. Set forth in a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are members or, if there are no members or the corporation's members do not have voting rights, by all persons who are directors at the time of the agreement;</p><p>2. Subject to amendment only by all persons who are members or, if the corporation's members do not have voting rights, by all persons who are directors at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and</p><p>3. Valid for an unlimited duration, if the agreement is set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, unless the agreement shall be otherwise amended by the members or the directors, as the case may be; or if the agreement is set forth in a written agreement, as set forth in the agreement except that the duration of an agreement that became effective prior to July 1, 2015, remains 10 years unless the agreement provided otherwise or is subsequently amended to provide otherwise.</p><p>C. The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate evidencing membership, if any. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it.</p><p>D. An agreement authorized by this section shall cease to be effective when the corporation has more than 300 members of record. If the agreement ceases to be effective for any reason, the board of directors may, if the agreement is contained or referred to in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws, adopt an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, without member action, to delete the agreement and any references to it.</p><p>E. An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.</p><p>F. The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any member for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in a failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.</p><p>G. Incorporators or subscribers for membership interests may act as members or directors with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no members have been elected or appointed or, in the case of a corporation that has no members, no directors are elected or holding office when the agreement was made.</p><p>H. No action taken pursuant to this section shall change any requirement to file articles or other documents with the Commission or affect the rights of any creditors or other third parties.</p><p>I. An agreement among the members or the directors of a corporation that is consistent with the other provisions of this chapter that does not comply with the provisions of this section shall nonetheless be effective among the members, the directors, and the corporation.</p><p>1991, c. 132; 1997, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0217'>217</a>; 2007, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0925'>925</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0611'>611</a>.</p>"

The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;</p><p>2.

The transaction was fair to the corporation.</p><p>B.

A transaction shall not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director who is not disinterested does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision A 1 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.</p><p>C. For purposes of subdivision A 2, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. The votes controlled by a director who is not disinterested may not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interests transaction under subdivision A 2. The director's votes, however, may be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this Act.

A corporation may sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of its assets, with or without the good will, otherwise than in the usual and regular course of business, on the terms and conditions and for the consideration determined by the corporation's board of directors, if the board of directors adopts and its members approve the proposed transaction.</p><p>B.

The board of directors shall adopt a resolution authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition to the members for their approval. The board of directors shall also submit to the members a recommendation that the members approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall transmit to the members the basis for that determination.</p><p>2. The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed transaction on any basis.</p><p>3.

The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the agreement pursuant to which the disposition will be effected. If only a summary of the agreement is sent to members, the corporation shall also send a copy of the agreement to any member who requests it.</p><p>4. Unless the board of directors, acting pursuant to subdivision 2 of this subsection, requires a greater vote, the disposition to be authorized shall be approved by more than two-thirds of all the votes cast on the disposition at a meeting at which a quorum exists. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the disposition by each voting group entitled to vote on the disposition at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p><p>5. Unless the parties to the disposition have agreed otherwise, after a disposition of assets has been approved by members, and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further member action in accordance with the procedure set forth in the resolution proposing the disposition or, if none is set forth, by the board of directors.</p><p>C. For a transaction to be authorized where there are no members, or no members having voting rights, the proposed transaction shall be authorized upon receiving the vote of a majority of the directors in office.</p><p>D.

Each member shall make loans to the corporation as and when called upon by it to do so. Such loans shall be made upon terms and conditions as shall be approved from time to time by the board of directors, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>1. All loans shall be evidenced by transferable instruments of the corporation and shall bear interest at a rate of not less than one-half of one percent in excess of the rate of interest determined by the board of directors to be prevalent commercial banking prime or base rate on unsecured commercial loans as of the date of the loan.</p><p>2. If expressly provided in such call, the loan may provide for a rate of interest which fluctuates with the prime or base rate from time to time and which would be subject during the life of the loan to adjustment as of each interest period commencing after the next interest payment date.</p><p>3. All loan limits shall be established at the $1000 amount nearest to the amount computed in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p>4. No loan pursuant to call under this section to a development corporation shall be made if immediately thereafter the total amount of the obligations of the corporation would exceed ten times the amount of its outstanding and unimpaired capital stock, its earned and unimpaired surplus established pursuant to § <a href='http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/13.1-994/'>13.1-994</a> and any indebtedness expressly subordinated to loans made pursuant to call under this section.</p><p>5.

All loan limits shall be recomputed as of January 1 of each even-numbered year, but no member's loan limit shall be increased as the result of such recomputation without the consent of such member.</p><p>7. Each call for loans made by the corporation shall be prorated among the members of the corporation in substantially the same proportion that the adjusted loan limit of each member bears to the aggregate of the adjusted loan limits of all members. The \"adjusted loan limit\" of a member shall be the amount of such member's loan limit, reduced by the balance of outstanding loans made by such member to the corporation and the investment of such member in capital stock of the corporation at the time of such call.</p><p>8.

The articles of organization or an operating agreement of a limited liability company may delegate full or partial responsibility for managing a limited liability company to or among one or more managers.</p><p>B. Managers need not be residents of this Commonwealth or members of the limited liability company unless the articles of organization or an operating agreement so require. The articles of organization or an operating agreement may prescribe other qualifications for managers.</p><p>C. The number of managers shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement. The number of managers may be increased or decreased by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of organization or an operating agreement.</p><p>D. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, managers shall be elected by the members.</p><p>E. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, any vacancy occurring in the office of manager shall be filled by a majority vote of the members.</p><p>F. All managers or any lesser number may be removed in the manner provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement. If the articles of organization or an operating agreement does not provide for the removal of managers, then all managers or any lesser number may be removed with or without cause by a majority vote of the members.</p><p>G.

Such persons may be denominated as officers of the limited liability company without being deemed to have the status of a manager, unless designated as a manager in the articles of organization or an operating agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, such delegation by a manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the manager to cease to be a manager of the limited liability company.</p><p>I. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, the managers of a limited liability company may take any action permitted or required to be taken by the managers without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by managers having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting. A consent transmitted by a manager by electronic transmission shall be deemed to be signed for the purposes of this section. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers may vote in person or by proxy, and any such proxy may be granted in writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p><p>J. The articles of organization or an operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of managers having such relative rights, powers, and duties as the articles of organization or an operating agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement of additional classes or groups of managers having such relative rights, powers, and duties as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers, and duties senior to existing classes and groups of managers.</p><p>1991, c. 168; 1992, c. 574; 1996, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?961+ful+CHAP0265'>265</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0432'>432</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0288'>288</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0601'>601</a>.</p>"

Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on the original obligation may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs.</p><p>D. The articles of organization or an operating agreement may provide in writing that the interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that he is obligated to make shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting member's proportionate interest in a limited liability company, subordinating his interest in the limited liability company to that of nondefaulting members, a forced sale of his interest in the limited liability company, forfeiture of his interest in the limited liability company, the lending by other members of the amount necessary to meet his commitment, a fixing of the value of his interest in the limited liability company by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of his interest in the limited liability company at such value, or other penalty or consequence.</p><p>E. No promise by a member to contribute to a limited liability company is enforceable unless set out in a writing signed by the member.</p><p>F. The contributions of a corporation to a limited liability company of which such corporation is a member may be in the form of an asset for which an application for a project requiring a certificate has been approved by the Commissioner pursuant to the provisions of Title 32.1. No further approval by such Commissioner shall be required as a condition to the validity of the member's contribution of such an asset to the limited liability company if (i) both the member and the limited liability company have their principal offices within the same city or county of the Commonwealth, (ii) such contributing member owns at least one-third of the membership interests of the limited liability company, and (iii) the assets contributed by such member to the limited liability company comprise not more than ten percent of such assets of the member.</p><p>1991, c. 168; 1995, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?951+ful+CHAP0168'>168</a>; 1999, c. <a href='http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+ful+CHAP0966'>966</a>.</p>"
